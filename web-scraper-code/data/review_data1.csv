5,I had amir install my home automation system for me and he gave me a new ethernet port right next to my bed stand so now I can work from bed :))))) super professional with best equipment and competitive price would definitely work with again
1,"Contractor was provided the make and model of the playground equipment to be assembled. We agreed on a price and he said he could complete the job the following week, in time for my kid's birthday. On the day he was supposed to be there, he called 40 minutes before he was to arrive and said he looked into the playground more and thought it would take too long to assemble for the price we agreed upon. In a rush to get it done in time for my kid's birthday, I agreed to pay more. He said he had to finish another project and would be there soon. He never called back and never showed up. DO NOT USE THIS CONTRACTOR! He's not a man of his word. I had 2 friends willing to help the weekend before, but cancelled them when I decided to pay for the assembly. This guy left me hanging at the last minute and my kid got a half assembled playground on his birtday. Thanks for NOTHING!"
