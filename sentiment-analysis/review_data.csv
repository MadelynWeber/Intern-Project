1,"Contractor was provided the make and model of the playground equipment to be assembled. We agreed on a price and he said he could complete the job the following week, in time for my kid's birthday. On the day he was supposed to be there, he called 40 minutes before he was to arrive and said he looked into the playground more and thought it would take too long to assemble for the price we agreed upon. In a rush to get it done in time for my kid's birthday, I agreed to pay more. He said he had to finish another project and would be there soon. He never called back and never showed up. DO NOT USE THIS CONTRACTOR! He's not a man of his word. I had 2 friends willing to help the weekend before, but cancelled them when I decided to pay for the assembly. This guy left me hanging at the last minute and my kid got a half assembled playground on his birtday. Thanks for NOTHING!"

5,"From start to finish, working with Lou and Budget Exteriors couldn't have been easier. My building has been wanting to do siding for awhile but have always been unable to do it because of the price. When I talked to Lou, he generally made it feel like you knew him for years. He got us a great price on siding and the quality is top notch. Here's the kicker too, from delivery of the dumpster to departure was only 6 business days. Workers were unreal, one of them was literally on his knees sweeping up the debris from the yard. I couldn't be happier with the way this turned out! I will definitely use them in the future and will be recommending them to my friends and neighbors! Thanks again!  - Rick M. Dorchester, MA"

After talking to John, I could see where his approach to the job was going to give me the look and quality I wanted. The installation team were all really great folks. I couldn't believe how fast the installation went and how great it looks. Definitely recommend them."
4,"I love my windows, Angel and Ray were very professional, they still came even we had a winter storm the day of install, I know Lou tried to get me in his schedule as early as possible but it eventually got done. Thank you."
5,"We had Budget Extreiors install vinyl siding on an apartment building that we own. They did a great job. I cannot believe the transformation. Very happy with the quality of the work.

They replaced old faux brick with new Portsmouth Shakes siding on 2 sections of the house and we’re very pleased with the outcome and workmanship. It was a great decision to choose them, the team is honest, professional, punctual and very clean. Everything was done well beyond our satisfaction. We hope to have other projects in the near future as we look forward to working with them again. Thank you for the A+++ service. Undoubtedly a 10 out of 10."
5,"Budget Exteriors replaced the rubber roof on our 5 car garage and installed a gutter that I requested kind of last minute—all done very much to my satisfaction and timely. The only thing we had to wait for was the permit (well, we’re talking Boston…). I especially appreciated their responsiveness throughout the whole thing."
5,"The whole budget team was great start to finish.John and Lou maintained solid communication and Angel and Ray faced some rough weather and pushed through to deliver a great and production the end. Roof, siding and windows all in one shot. I wouldn’t hesitate to use budget again."
5,"Budget Exteriors was great to work with. They came on time and left the place clean, and did nice work for a reasonable price. I called them to help me out of a jam when the new window I had order in June was back ordered until December(!). I was halfway through demo, expecting the window MUCH sooner, and was looking at going into winter with the back of my house half ripped apart.   Lou and Angel came, framed in the window, put on the cedar shingle siding, matched up some misaligned basketweave on the corner, and competed all the finish work, then came back later once the window finally arrived to install it. They even put new trim on an adjacent window to match.   I would definitely hire them again."
5,"Our house was in rough shape and needed all the rotten boards replaced under the gutters. They completed the job in two days. They were professional, friendly and left the job spotless. We didn't find any issues with the job. It was done great. I highly recommend them."
5,Budget Exteriors did a great job replacing three hopper windows in our basement and two missing pieces of siding from our house. Everybody at Budget Exteriors was friendly and easy to work with. We would happily work with them again.
5,I hired Budget Exteriors to replace 6 basement windows and would definitely hire them again for future projects. My job was relatively small for window replacements but John was able to give me a good price and Angel was meticulous with the install. Budget Exteriors was great to work with and I would recommend them over any of the national window companies.
5,"I've been looking for a contractor to replace siding on a few walls of our house and ended up working with Budget Exteriors after quite a bit of search. The initial communication and estimates were seamless, done in time we agreed to, no delays, no reminders. The estimate wasn't the lowest I got, but still very reasonable and competitive. The work crew was good as well, everything was done very quickly and looked good along the way. We encountered a little unexpected problem during the installation, which they addressed quickly and without any questions.  All in all, very satisfied and would not hesitate to work with them again."
5,"I had contacted another roofing company in May about doing my roof . they told me that I was on there list to be done. I waited three months calling several times to be told ""Your on the list."" In August I called Budget and within 48 hours had an estimate and within 3 weeks had a new roof. The crew came out on the hottest day in August and put on a new roof in one day. They were professional and cleaned up exceptionally well. Very pleased with this company and would definitely have them do more work for when needed. Moira Toscano Roslindale MA"
5,"Was on time, very responsive and when they left there was not a leaf to be found in the yard. Some of my neighbors have even asked who I had because it was so clean."
1,"The individual showed up late without informing me or apologizing. Upon reviewing the job, he continued to tell me he couldn’t do what I was asking but didn’t offer a reasonable solution. He sent me a couple of texts two days later telling me I shouldn’t proceed as planned again with no solution. I never received an estimate. Terrible!!!!"
1,"They forgot to complete a portion of my roof per my contract. I was told that they would come back and complete it since their workers made the mistake. It has been 5 months!! I was told it’s an hour job, and I had to wait my turn. When they charged me 10k they were here within a week!! Unprofessional, and I will be reaching out to a lawyer."
1,"We signed a contract for siding replacement in May 2021 and received no follow up or timeline for the job for six months. The excuse was that the city hadn’t issued a permit.

Budget kept us waiting for six months and the only contact was with the estimator sent inappropriate emails with extremely unprofessional behavior.

5,"John was amazing, honest, organized and helpful at explaining roofing basic and important info, giving me a free quote. I loved how flexible they were with rescheduling. Unfortunately wasn’t able to move forward with their service because there was a lot to do on my roof and it was pricey for us at the moment."
5,Budget exterior did a great job! we have new insulated windows which means less noise from the neighborhood! They were responsive and gave us a reasonable price! will call them for the rest of the windows soon!
1,"The individual showed up late without informing me or apologizing. Upon reviewing the job, he continued to tell me he couldn’t do what I was asking but didn’t offer a reasonable solution. He sent me a couple of texts two days later telling me I shouldn’t proceed as planned again with no solution. I never received an estimate. Terrible!!!!"
1,"They forgot to complete a portion of my roof per my contract. I was told that they would come back and complete it since their workers made the mistake. It has been 5 months!! I was told it’s an hour job, and I had to wait my turn. When they charged me 10k they were here within a week!! Unprofessional, and I will be reaching out to a lawyer."

5,We hired Budget exteriors to complete our home siding project. From start to finish their team was phenomenal! We received 5 quotes and Budget Exteriors beat all of their competition in both quality and price. Their team came within the planned time frame and communication was great! They restored our 120+ year home with detached garage with such great care. I would highly recommend Budget Exteriors to anyone looking for a quality home siding professional!
5,"Lou replaced the fiber-cement siding on my house. I am very happy with the work he did. The siding looks very neat. The project was completed in a timely manner. The communication was great: Lou was very responsive to my emails and calls, and he was very clear explaining the process and setting expectations."
5,I needed my roof shoveled fro the impending blizzard and Louis had a crew out there the afternoon I called him! Good and quick work!
5,"I had consultations with a number of contractors before selecting Budget Exteriors. Lou was very professional, responded to emails and phone calls within 24 hrs, and gave me a number of references. I went on-site to one of his references to verify that the job was done well.  Lou came in with the lowest estimate, even accounting for the cost of the siding proposed by various contractors. Even though the project took longer than estimated (an old, warped house is difficult to side properly) the job was done well and neighbors have stopped by to praise the work. Also, Lou does not nickel and dime, his word is reliable. Of course, do get everything in writing before starting the project.  I believe Lou does not directly employ the 3-5 crews that work for him; they are subcontracted. That's the only thing I didn't know at the outset. They did a great job though. Your results may vary with the crew you get."
5,I was extremely satisfied with the quality of the work as well as the pricer the overall job.

1,When I called the company they said they could replace my windows with Harvey windows. So I made an appointment for them to come out and give me a price. The gentleman surveyed my windows and told me he could get Harvey's windows in 4 to 6 weeks. While talking I mention I replaced one of the windows in my house myself. He asked why I wasn't replacing the 2 windows I asked them to replace. He said he would get a price to me asap. One week later I left multiple messages for them to get back with a quote. They finally called and said they couldn't find the price of harvey windows but he would definitely get back to me in a couple days. 2 weeks later still no quote. They wasted my time.
4,They did a satisfactory job !
5,Very responsive
1,"Told Mike's salesman I'm in hurry to get this job done within the next two weeks because I've had too many guys waste my time. Little did I know they were going to do the same.  Called his salesman and pushed for the quote because I didn't get it when promised. Got the quote and never heard back from them. 11 days later Mike is giving me grief telling me its MY fault for not chasing after them! I have other companies diligently contacting me for my business! I shouldn't have to chase after anyone to give them my money!!  With everything I have going on, I have to push them to do their job? They have one job to do, and that's work with the customers that they find! If they can't even do that, how can I expect them to take care of me after the sale?  He told me that he normally doesn't hear from people for 6 months. Ridiculous! Again, I mentioned that I told his salesman I needed this done by the end of the month and even expressed a sense of urgency with getting the quote and asked if I gave them the job, how soon would they be able to do it? His salesman said by the third week of June.  Mike vented to me (the customer) in a way he shouldn't. What ever happened to the customer is always right? How he sees himself and his company as being polished is beyond me. Making excuses for dragging their feet is bad behavior for any business owner, especially when the customer is telling them you need this done soon! I don't like the blameless attitude he has and the way he points the blame on the customer. When I was in sales and management in IT and finances, the correct thing to do was always follow up after a quote within 24hrs. Especially when the customer is making it clear that there's a sense of urgency. Not only has Budget exterior shown me they have a lackadaisical attitude but Mike convinced me that they didn't care about messing up my busy calendar with their procrastination. They were going to get back to me when it was convenient for them. And now, he's raising his voice at me because he doesn't to admit he's wrong?   Last night I got fed up with the way we were going back and forth and I had to tell him the truth that they wasted my time. Calling me up today to raise your voice at the customer is very, very wrong! I questioned his professionalism weeks ago when I spoke with him. He seemed rather abrupt & rude. He called and left me a voice message later apologizing for the way he spoke to me because of his 3 dogs barking when there was someone at the door. That's not an excuse for not being unprofessional. I figured I'd give him another chance since he apologized. But now after the call he made to me, he convinced me I wasn't dealing with someone I can trust to do business with.   I Really hate it when people act nice just to get your business but when they realize they lost it, they stop the pretense and show you what they're really like. Mike did not try to understand my point of view. He was being very argumentative and hard to communicate with. He has an unbelievable bad temper! He just wanted to call me and act like a tough guy, to give me a hard time, and what was important to him was that he get the message across that they are right and I am wrong. I didn't appreciate how he spoke to me and would never do business with them!"
1,"I set an appointment for an estimate. The owner didnt show up and he never called. I called him, left a message and got no response. I called four hours later and was sent to voice mail. Have the work done before giving him the money !!!"

I even called and left a voicemail and a message on here. No reply or explanation whatsoever. Very disappointed.

I wish I went with a different technician.  1. Tv mount: did not use a stud finder, ended up making 5 holes on the wall and still the mount is not firm.  2. Additional plug point: made the hole and then said he will not be able to do it  3. Recessed light for bedroom: cut open the wall and then said he will not be able to do it 4.

5,"We just bought our first house and wanted to fix up a few things that were mentioned in our home inspection report before we moved in—Joe and his crew went above and beyond, and were very patient with my total lack of understanding about home repair. They installed a washer valve, drain pan, shower fixture, fixed a burner on my stovetop, patched several screen windows, and replaced the GFCI outlet on the balcony in a day; next week, they're coming back to replace a screen door, and install a filter under the sink that hadn't arrived in time for the appointment. I hope we figure out how to do some of this stuff ourselves one day, but boy, am I glad I convinced my husband to leave it to the professionals this time. We are definitely keeping the Savino Services business card on front and center on our fridge for when we need it."
5,"Responded within an hour of my inquiry, service was performed within 48 hours. On time. Super professional. Easy to talk to. Great value.

5,A great experience and really appreciated the hands on information. Would call again for another servicing or furnace trouble.
3,"I appreciate the quick response to get the job done. It took all day to replace our range head and a few outlets. I’ll say this, I asked for an invoice multiple times from them and followed up when I could. He said he would get it out to me but never did. My stupid mistake was paying him before I got that invoice because now I don’t even know what I’m paying him for. I was highly upset that it was so expensive and the cost didn’t make sense so I wanted to know exactly what I was paying for. I would’ve still paid but not I have no record of what was done what it costed and such. Or $50 and hour I sure paid a hell of a lot more than that. I will not call them back again and they definitely just lost a loyal customer."

5,"I highly recommend Savino Services. They added on two new zones to my heating system. They came out right away, did the job professionally and were fairly priced. I will definitely use Savino again."
5,I highly recommend Joe. He was responsive and reliable so definitely someone you can trust and rely on to have what you need fixed done. He also comes prepared with the part needed and saves us tons of time as well. Thanks Joe!!
5,A great experience and really appreciated the hands on information. Would call again for another servicing or furnace trouble.
3,"I appreciate the quick response to get the job done. It took all day to replace our range head and a few outlets. I’ll say this, I asked for an invoice multiple times from them and followed up when I could. He said he would get it out to me but never did. My stupid mistake was paying him before I got that invoice because now I don’t even know what I’m paying him for. I was highly upset that it was so expensive and the cost didn’t make sense so I wanted to know exactly what I was paying for. I would’ve still paid but not I have no record of what was done what it costed and such. Or $50 and hour I sure paid a hell of a lot more than that. I will not call them back again and they definitely just lost a loyal customer."
5,"Savino Services made the whole process of fixing a variety of electrical requests easy. They promptly provided availability, allocated the entire day to ensure enough time, were responsive to questions, arrived on time and did not leave until all issues were assessed and/or resolved. 10/10 would rehire again!"
5,I had an issue with a recently installed Nest thermostat and my heat went down. I called Savino Services and they were able to fit me in right away. My heat was up and working later that morning. I hope to use them again to install central air in my home.
5,"Joe really saved us when our heat and hot water died in January! He responded right away, came out same day, and immediately diagnosed the issue with our boiler. When there were some issues with part shipment (not his fault), he was super communicative and understanding the whole time. He even was able to perform a routine service on our boiler while he was there. Super reasonable price and so helpful. Definitely will reach out again in the future!"
5,"“It has been a real pleasure for us to have a company like Savino to come and work on installing out garbage disposal and a new dishwasher in our house. The staff not only delivered a satisfying job, but also made sure to explained everything that needed to be explained. This was done without sacrificing quality.” Thank you Joe and team, you guys were fantastic and very professional."
5,Why is 5 stars my limit?! Went through 5 tradesmen pointing the finger at each other on how to fix my boiler / nest thermostat issues.  Joe and Dennis came through & were awesome!!!  Already have them lined up for 2 more projects!!! Thank You Gentlemen!!!!

5,Joe sent out a team to solve a complex heating problem that I had with my single pipe steam heat system. A steam pipe in a wall had corroded and was leaking steam!

Almost nobody has expertise in single pipe steam like that! Highly recommended!

5,Joe was a stand up guy who did a great job installing my dishwasher and garbage disposal. He also made sure to explain that I shouldn’t turn on hit water while using the garbage disposal because it would break it. (Who knew ha)   Appreciate his work and would hire him again!

2,"I hired Joe 2 times. The first time to fix an outdoor outlet, which was difficult task and he did a great job. Therefore, I hired him again for a bigger job i.e. to convert my shed to office.   We agreed on the price, and timeline to finish the work in December 2020. I paid advance as well. And he started some ground work, but decided in middle of the project that it’s not worth his time/money, and became unresponsive to most of my messages/calls. It’s April 2021, and nothing got done.  I told him that I’ll be open to increase budget, if he comes and talks to me. But that didn’t happen after several follow-ups. I’ll still give him 2 stars because he is a good"
5,"Our school used Savino services to get a Life breath HVAC system. They were very prompt in their responses and were professional. Their whole team was extremely friendly and responsive. They were detail oriented and meticulous, and made sure to clean up our space after the job was done. We throughly enjoyed working with them and we would definitely recommend them!"
5,"I had a garbage disposal replaced. Text communication to set up time and details went smoothly, the work looks great."
5,"Joe and his crew were a pleasure to deal with. Honest, pleasant, helpful, and so neat! They did everything as per the contract and more so- coming up with creative solutions to some tough problems, redoing anything I asked, including repainting walls when I realized I didn’t like the color I had picked. And they did so with smiles. Joe even called our insurance agent to get assurances that additional problems would be covered by insurance. Their price was fair, and the work was terrific. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them! Thanks Joe, Theresa, Ana and Dennis!"

After comparison with other services, I decided to work with Joe and it was really the right decision. Joe answers questions quickly and efficiently when I did inquiry and quote, and prepare the materials and do the installation with high quality and his team is professional.

5,"I am VERY happy with Joe. Found him knowledgeable, professional and reliable. He replaceD 2 garage windows that I believe to have been there for 60 years . Great job! I expect to be hiring him again in the future. It’s nice to find a contractor you can feel comfortable hiring to work on your home!"
5,"Joe came right on time at 10 am, replaced 2 bi-fold doors. Very professional! one of the doors was extremely difficult but Joe kept his cool and worked thru and made it work!

5,"Joe and his team were great to work with. Needed a dryer hookup, garbage disposal installation and a few other things in our new but older house. Was a bit more than they thought but Joe was able to grab a number of things from his truck that were needed and helped in areas that I didn’t think needed updates. I’d recommend Joe for anything needed and will definitely be calling again. Thanks, Joe!"
5,"Joe came out to look at our steam heating system & boiler because we have some extra loud radiators in the house. He was very thorough in examining the boiler and pointed out a few repairs that need to be made. He inspected all of the radiators to make sure they were functioning properly. Joe also took the time to educate me on how the steam boiler functions and why the various repairs needed to be made.  Before he left, Joe said that he would provide an estimate on the identified repairs and also some potential availability in the next few weeks. I'm very happy with the quality of Savino Services."
5,"Joe and his team were excellent! I had an urgent request and they was able to come by on short notice, first thing in the morning. They worked quickly and were reasonably priced—we’ll definitely have them back for more work in the future!"
5,Highly recommended went above and beyond to install the bathroom countertop even without his way to purchase the front faucet for us.
5,"These are really nice, honest people. While they were here to install our disposal, we asked them to figure out why we had water dripping in our garage (apparently from a bathroom), and they determined it was due to a partly clogged pipe. They recommended we hire someone who does ""rotar rootering"" and didn't charge us anything for diagnosing the problem for us."
5,Joe and his team did the work we agreed upon plus fixed some additional issues we were unaware of. Great to work with and would definitely recommend.
5,Joe came out and fixed a connector on a 2 person sauna. He was fast to respond and came out to do the job the same day. The cost was reasonable and he was very professional. I’d hire him again.

5,"Joe and his team were wonderful! Timely, attentive, and all around nice people. I will absolutely be working with them again!"
5,"Phenomenal Service. Done with compassion and commitment. Accommodated me on the day I reached out. Came by later in the day and got the job done. Drove me back to the store to buy the correct materials. Price was the most affordable for which I am grateful because I have an entire unit to rehab. I am so impressed with Joe Savino, his 2 very pleasant workers, their dedication in working outside in the cold, solving the numerous problems that came up with the project, staying as late as they needed to, to get the job done right. I can only hope that he gives me the same dedicated service at a price I cannot refuse in renovating my 3 bedroom rental unit. It would be a pleasure to continue to work with them. Very Highly recommend."

5,We could not have asked for a more professional team to work with. We had a very difficult unusual job of removing a floor hatch for a washer / dryer delivery and Joe made sure everything went well. He even came back the next day to help me with something else. Highly recommend!
5,"Responded immediately, clear communications, got everything fixed."
5,Theyve been very responsive and the quality of their work is excellent.

1,"""Where do I begin!  Always Always READ THE REVIEWS FIRST BEFORE PICKING SOMEONE. If I had done that I wouldn't have picked JOE SAVINO. Also read his responses to negative reviews. It shows a lot about his professionalism and creditability  Issue 1 - He didn't take notes of the conversation as we went through the unit. He took days to send over the invoice and missed a few things. He gave an invoice that wasn't itemized even.  Issue 1A - Upon a second visit and came with his young daughter. At the time I didn't think much of it but after thought it was a scam to lower a person guard and come off as a wholesome contractor depicting a loving father/daughter bonding moment   Issue 2 - He did not order any items, which for a GC, they typically get a discount on items, that most consumer do not get. So I could then reimburse him. I found this odd that he would want me the client to order. I understand that lights and small items the client can purchase but big tickets items like a kitchen package with a GC discount would save me tons of money.  Issue 2A - The appliances were delayed by a week due to a scheduling mishap on the delivery company and JOE SAVINO wanted to upcharge me  Issue 2B - Even with the delay Joe Savino told me he would be the"
5,"Savino come on time, did the project with complete professionalism. I would use him again and refer him to others."
5,Great guy. Trustworthy and does a solid job. I would use him again!
5,"Very professional, thorough and detailed. Highly recommend!"
2,Hired to fix some outlets. Came over an hour late. Took a look at them and basically said he couldn’t fix them. Charged me $200 for a consultation and only fixed 1 out of 3 of them. Not great service or attitude.
5,"Great work, thanks Joe"
5,Very good a/c replacement for one put into a wall
2,"I may have missed it, but I assumed I was paying $45 an hour, I did not realize there was a minimum 3 hours. This must have been in the fine print. There were 2 things that needed to be done, one which was completed took 10 minutes and I was charged $156, the other he could not perform offered to come back on Tuesday, never heard from him, but as he was going to charge me another $156, not particularly worried. In summary, I paid $156 FOR HALF A JOB that took 10 minutes."
5,We had Savino install our bath faucet and kitchen faucet along with our garbage disposal job was well done and we will call them back for sure for any other future projects
5,Fantastic crew outstanding work will definitely use again installed lighting and fans make sure to call you will not be disappointed Joe was awesome
3,"My gas boiler wasn't working properly. When I asked Joe about the license, he said he has the license to work on Gas boilers. I think he's very pricey."
5,Highly recommended. Saved money and did an excellent job !!!
5,Was well prepared. Finish the job fast and perfectly. Would hire again!
5,Had a nice experience when we had an issue with our heating and hot water. Would hire again!

5,Installed my garage disposal. Happy with the results. Would use them again.
3,"I needed a garbage disposal installed where there was none and needed an electric connection run from the board to the garbage disposal. I received several quotes for this described job, one of them was Savino. I was going to provide the garbage disposal. There was misunderstanding on who was to provide plumbing supplies. They may be nominal costs. But the quote to perform the job went up from $175 to $500 at which point I felt to re-evaluate and shop around. I didn't hire Savino for the job. They were friendly, responsive and punctual, I just couldn't get past the price change."
5,Replaced faucet and supply lines. Punctual and professional.
5,"Joe was very friendly, professional, knowledgeable and easy to work with. Would hire again."
5,Brad and Joe were rockstars. Needed a bunch of things assembled and they took the stress off my shoulders

5,Joe and his crew did an outstanding job for us mounting and wiring multiple monitors as well as construction of our offices we recommend the highly you will like the crew and quality workmanship
2,"UPDATE: 2.17.2021 I had great luck with Joe on my first project and hired him again to do a number of projects around my house. I still think that the work done was excellent but the lack of communication with the second project was disappointing. The work was not done in a timely manner and, at this point, work that was to be completed on my laundry room is still not finished. I have not heard from Joe in over 3 months and am sadly, not satisfied with the lack of communication and incomplete job.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: I appreciated Joe's communication with me throughout the project and his honesty about the possible cost depending on the extent of the damage inside my exterior wall. The team was very professional and the job was well done."
3,The wiring was abnormal but they were able to make sense of it and complete the job

1,Have 4 heating zones. Had an issue with one of them not working. After Joe from Savino came out he blew 2 fuses and 2 circulators and now only one of my heating zone works. I went from 3 of 4 working before Savnio came out to now only 1 zone working. Insetad of the $95 to come out it was $160. Then was told we'll email you with everything you need... never heard anything back.
5,Couldn't ask for anything better
1,"Joe came to give me a quote to replace a kitchen fan and a bathroom fan. When his quote came in it was astronomical at $14,000. I had the bathroom fan replaced yesterday by a different company and it cost $500 including the fan."

1,Don’t ever call Michel B. Handymen. This person in incompetent aggressive and rude. He has no idea what he is doing and completely destroyed my dishwasher. We had an issue of the water not filling so he took the door off and When the dishwasher started to fill up it destroyed the electrical panel. He tried to blame the dishwasher saying it was old. I could care less about the dishwasher but he scared my daughters and was aggressive towards my wife screaming and using foul language. It came to a point where I told him that if he won’t leave immediately I’ll call the police.

5,Very honest
1,"Very unprofessional. I had Michael install an outdoor light fixture. A very easy job I probably could have completed on my own, but did not have the time to get it done. He gave me an estimate of $250 to complete the job, which was a little high, but he was able to come out quickly, so I agreed.   He came to my condo to diagnose the issue with my light, but arrived late. He determined the light fixture needed to be replaced, but wouldn't be able to complete the job until I went and purchased a new light fixture. He asked that I pay the $250 at this time, and $25 dollars for gas for him to return and replace the fixture. He also said he did not have any caulking for the job, and said I would need to go buy some. I figured expenses such as gas and supplies like caulking would be included in the estimated price, but I reluctantly agreed just so I could get the job done at this point.   After purchasing the fixture and caulking, I scheduled a day for him to come complete the job. We scheduled for 3pm. About 30 min past the scheduled date and time, I still had not heard from Michael. I texted him and asked if he still planned on coming. He responded and said that he was at another job in Maine, and would not be able to come for about another 4 hours, which was not going to work with my schedule. We rescheduled for him to come the following day.   Michael was scheduled to arrive at my condo at 7am, but was late again, arriving more than an hour late. After ""completing"" the job, Michael texted me and stated that he could not caulk in the fixture, because he had left his caulk gun at another job. Michael did not indicate that he planned on returning to caulk it in, and suggested that I do it myself. After inspecting the work Michael completed, the light did not appear to be level and the fixture itself was loose from the wall.  I would not recommend hiring Michael unless you want to overpay, be nickel and dimed for things like gas and materials, which should be included in the quoted price, and have to deal with an unprofessional individual. At the very least he got the light working with the new fixture.  Michael identifies himself as an Army veteran in his profile. I am a veteran myself, and this is one of the reasons I trusted hiring him. However, this is not the way a veteran should conduct themselves when doing business."

My only constructive criticism about this company would be to pay a little more attention to communication. Communications only ever really happened when I initiated them - as a customer, it is always reassuring to get updates from a company, especially when you are trying to juggle work etc, about expectations of time, whether a part has arrived, etc - a little in advance of scheduling an appointment. Once the communications were initiated by me, everything went smoothly. Dishwasher fixed, I am happy with Ivan's work, so 5 stars!"

And when we asked for the model of the part or range, he refused to tell us for fear we'd do a price check. Unfortunately we were in a pinch and needed the work done asap.  I wouldn't recommend this outfit. And that's very rare for me as I always give top reviews."

1,Advertisement was not accurate. Ut cost me $180 for 15 minutes of work. Did not mention senior discount. This was after they canceled our first appointment.  Will not use this company again.
1,Not experts in GE Washing Machine. Recommended to replace Mother board while the problem was with Sensor.
1,"Very unsatisfactory! On the first visit, technician said he couldn’t find anything wrong. On 2nd visit a week later, he said the same thing even after I had explained the situation. He didn’t check anything but the freezer temp. I called a 3rd time and he guessed what the problem could be and quoted a hefty fee. Mind you, this was a guess. I don’t recommend them! Too bad I paid the $100 consultation fee!"
1,This company is a scam....do not use. They are dishonest and don't know what they are doing.
2,Fixed the problem. Price was 49 an hour. Did a bait and switch and pricing ended up charging 180 and hour. Fixed the problem in 15 minutes and still charged 180.
4,The follow up was professional.
1,The person never got back to me with any information after we connected. Totally weird!

1,"First the ""Pros"" waited till almost the end of my window to tell me they needed to come later or reschedule and we had the latest window to start with. The service person showed and then told me the part needed to fix my washer was no longer available (this was not true and was available from multiple sources). I called and when I told the ""office"" this information I was told a manager would have to call me back. Instead I received a text telling me they agreed the part was available but only wanted to use an aftermarket parts distributer who wanted to charge $130+ more than the actual manufacturer for the needed part citing they could not warranty the part if it came from the manufacturer and not their parts person. You cannot call with an issue because the ""manager"" who was able to immediately text me would not be available for several hours and in fact never did call me back. These guys are horrible and did not even attempt to work with me other than to say there was nothing they could do."
1,He didn’t take the Washing machine apart. He just guessed what could be wrong just talking to my husband. After he left we took it apart and found the springs ( what he said to replace) all in tact. He also said he didn’t know if it would fix the problem. Terrible service!!!
1,next time send a pro. The problem was not what he said.

1,First of all charge the amount you quote and then fix the problem to customer’s satisfaction. This tech insisted the problem was fixed and it was actually worse after he did the work. So $490 later still a washer that doesn’t work. He told my husband it works fine and he wasn’t coming back. Total rip off!

1,It was a complete waste of time and money.  Didnt even fix it but charged me 200$  Told me they would be able to fix it.  Came out wasted my time on 3 separate occasions.  Had I known they weren't going g to be able to fix it I could've spent that money towards a new one.  One of the 3 times the guy came out he told me at 12 (noon) he would be here in 30 min I waited around the whole day he showed up at 3pm

5,"Miguel was friendly, he showed up ahead of schedule, worked efficiently, and did a very good job installing my new vanity."
5,"My husband and I were very impressed with the responsiveness and the promptness of Miguel and his son. They came to see the job when they said they would and they started the job on the day they said they would. The job was done quickly and they left the area nice and clean. They did a really good job extending the stair wall and hanging a barn door. And, as a bonus they were really really nice guys to deal with!!"
5,Miguel did a great job installing the doggie door. His positive attitude and professionalism was on full display.
5,"Miguel was referred to me by a friend to check on my leaky dishwashers. He quickly found out the problems & fixed it!   We were going through some difficulty with some unfinished renovation/update & my husband let Miguel checked out our work. Miguel quoted us a deal & i can tell he’s trying to help out.   He started a week later as promised with his son daily to work on them. They listened to our concern & worked together solving many issues, often beyond our expectations eg he made our closet doors & shower door working better & looking better. He hung our shower panel a lot more secure than the youtube video that i watched. His son is also a very professional electrician, plumber & a creative problem solver. He worked efficiently & with care: he paid attention to protect our bath fixtures, eg he’d get drop cloth & papers to protect our bath tub b4 he drilled & installed any fixture, without me even asking. They also gave great advice on how to put things (towel bar, toilet paper holder) to make the space function better & more beautiful. The best part was they were so pleasant, joyful, polite & encouraging. I never imagined the work could be finished within 5 days but they worked hard to make it a reality. Honestly i was at my worst myself, but they were like angels helping us through. They have the best work ethics & are among those ppl (like my painter & my retired plumber who worked with me 7 yrs) that i would give an extra star if there is an option to give them 6 stars."

5,He was excellent and courteous. Made sure everything was do with care .
5,"Miguel is a true professional and man of his word. He does great work at reasonable prices. He's done plumbing, electrical and both interior and exterior finishing work for me, and I'm more than pleased. I'd give him 10 stars. He shows up when he says he will and cleans up and leaves work area nice and neat.He gets the job done quickly and doesn't mess around. He's my ""go to"" from now on. Hire him! You won't regret it."
5,He was honest what he can d6 and wiat he. Cannot do he help alot and i recomend him to ayone who needs a handy man
2,"I thought we were on the same page. He was kind when we met.  However, I felt I was being taken advantage with the cost of labor he was trying to charge me.  He asked me to get the material because his price for the material and labor was over my budget.  He told me he would charge me $400.00. I express that was extremely high.  I was able to find the material he needed to just board up my garage for $204.00. So $400.00 labor is double of what the material cost.  He said since I thought his labor was too much he didn't want to work with anymore, which I thought was immature. He didn't try to negotiate another price. As a consumer I have the right to express my feelings on pricing.  If he doesn't understand this then maybe he should not be in this business."
5,This professional was very efficient and thorough with each task/project I had. He showed up with a pleasant attitude and the goal of providing me with great customer service each day.

5,Erick showed up within an hour of requesting a quote. He was willing to work with us to help us avoid HOA fines and not blow our budget. He also went above and beyond to supply high quality materials and replace a broken sprinkler head for us so that we could water the sod. Would definitely recommend working with him!

5,"Torres landscaping responded quickly to my request for mulching my flower beds. I had contacted several other companies with ZERO response. After a brief conversation via messaging, we agreed on the scope of work and he was willing to come out the same day. But that did not work with my schedule so he came the following day. The work included him supplying mulch. He was early (wonderful) and completed the job quickly and to my satisfaction. He also took the extra effort to use a blower to blow away any stray mulch to give a tidy appearance. I could not have asked for better service at a better price."
5,They worked hard and fast to plant everything and make it look wonderful! Very helpful with suggestions and ideas to make the landscape pop.
5,Called Erick and told him I needed some sod installed by 5/28 at the latest and he showed up early on 5/26 to complete the job. They knocked out my entire back yard in about 5 hours. They even covered up some bare spots in the front yard for no extra cost. Torres Landscaping did a great job and met my expectations.

5,Torres Landscaping removed old dead plants and planted new plants for me. I thought they did a great job. They removed all of the old plants and positioned the new ones exactly where I needed them.  Erick is very responsive and also nice.  I will definitely contact them for future landscaping needs.
5,"I highly recommend the Torres family owned landscaping company. They were quick to respond and once they began the work, my yard was transformed over a period of two days. They are professional and the quality of work is above all others I have used in the past. It’s nice when a company does what they say they’re going to do. In fact they went overboard."
5,"Had a ton of weeds in our front and back yard flower beds. They removed all the weeds, put down a weed barrier and mulch and even added 6 bubbler sprinklers to our snowball hydrangea plants. They got there a little after 9am and we’re done just before 1pm. Super quick, friendly and professional! The value cannot be beat! They had the lowest quote compared to their competitors! They quoted me more than 50% less than the competition! Definitely go with Torres for your Landscaping needs!!! I have attached some before and after photos."

5,Erick and his team did a fantastic job mulching our beds and also planing 10 new Turk's caps plants.  Even cleaned up a bed that wasn't part of the price just so all the beds have consistent mulch. And he didn't mind purchasing bagged mulch from a certain provider.  I highly recommend and will reach out to Erick with any new mulching and planting needs.
5,"Christmas light install was great. They did a wonderful job and lights look really professional! Lights were cut specifically for our house, and when they come back to take them down, we get to keep them for the following years. Very easy to work with. Will definitely use again next year."

5,"Erick showed up on time for the first appointment and provided a prompt estimate. Then he kept in touch with me as I went through collecting other landscaping bids. Erick never rushed me for a decision but always made himself available for follow-up questions. In the end, my wife and I decided that Erick’s company, Torres landscaping was the right choice for the job. He was able to rapidly put me on his schedule while some of the others contractors could not schedule me for days. His crew showed up on time and completed the job within 3 days after I accepted his bid. My yard looks great and we are happy with the results."
5,Great punctual and high quality service. Very efficient as they provided everything for the lights that we get to keep after the season. The lights make me so happy!

Erick also worked with me on payments when I had an unexpected death in the family and had to reroute funds to help pay for those expenses—something that was truly appreciated and really above and beyond all of my expectations. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Erick to my friends or family and will definitely use his services for my next project."

5,His work was amazing!! Would definitely use him again!!!
5,"It’s challenging to find responsive and professional service providers nowadays. Torres was quick to respond to my inquiry and once we decided to proceed, he got the job done a few days later. My life is very busy and stressful right now due to my husband being ill. The yard work is now one less thing to worry about. Thank you!"
5,Tores did exactly what we discussed and did it all while I was being driven to the ER for a medical issue. He was easy to talk to and understood my requests. I would recommend him.
5,Erick bid in putting in 7 shrubs to replace my dead ones. His bid was reasonable and he got the work done quickly. I would hire him again.
5,"The work done was outstanding. They added topsoil and smoothed the yard before adding turf. They added some additional plants in the flower bed. The cost was reasonable, and Mr. Torres was the only one that talked about how much dirt was needed. We are very pleased with the results."
5,I am so impressed! My house was decorated 24 hours after my initial contact! It looks wonderful!!!
5,"I had never worked with Torres before and found them through a Google search. They were extremely responsive and also the cheapest quote I got. Once at my house, they were also able to help with a few other items in the yard at reasonable rates. Highly recommended!"

5,"Erick and his guys were super fast, and incredibly easy to work with. It was the most painless experience - they fixed my front yard and put in exactly what I asked for... new hedges and flowers. Definitely will use them again!"
5,"Erick Torres was one of five people  I interviewed but he was the only one who actually got down in the dirt and recognized what my problems were. He worked within my fairly modest budget to create a landscape that will look good all year long. He has a great aesthetic sense and, more importantly, shows up and cares about his work. I highly recommend him"
5,"My husband is really content with his work, he asked me to save his number in case we need him in the future, pricing was good, work was good!"
2,"The owner didn't come back to complete the job, the youngman left a corner of the property incomplete. He also showed up four days earlier than the day we were suppose to do the job. I had an event at my house and wanted the job completed specifically for the event."

1,"Reached out for an estimate, and passed messages back and forth for several days. Agreed that he would come out to inspect and give an estimate. Even confirmed when I would be available. After all of this wasted time, he asked me to send pictures so he wouldn’t waste his gas on the estimate. Pictures could have been requested right away. Very unprofessional."
1,"Torres landscaping was the worst experience I've ever had with a contractor. To simply explain here are the pictures of our landscape in less than a month. No one spends thousands of dollars for a temporary 1 week fix, expected it to last much longer, a lot longer. Was told by Torres after 2 weeks that this simply needs maintenance. At the end of the day we ended up reaching an agreement i was satisfied with. However, soon after he started sending very very unprofessional text messages. All I can say is Buyer Beware."

1,"Couldn't even get through a discussion on the job. They asked if I was a cheap person or if I like to spend money on designer things. And was never able to get a quote or information on the installation process. They are rude, condescending, and evasive."
1,"Unreliable company/ people. We hired them, paid a date hold fee and signed contract well in advance of the work date. When the work date was coming close I sent them courtesy messages to confirm and double confirm ( which I think typically the business sends) but they kept saying they are checking on their end. And never showed up to do the work and never responded to our many messages. They did refund our deposit. But now we are left with our work not being done as at this peak season time it’s hard to find someone.   If you value your time, please don’t hire them."

1,"I personally have not had a good experience with this company that I hired for Christmas lights installation. To begin, I made an appointment for an estimate and since they were running late and could not make it, I sent a picture. They replied with markings on where the lights would be. I agreed and scheduled. When the crew arrived they installed the lights but missed a part of the roof, stating that it was too steep to install the lights there. When I showed the crew the markings they went ahead and installed them. The light chords were just hanging instead of being neatly tucked in so you would not see them from the street. They stated that is why they use thin cables. I have since driven around areas to see other lights and even my own neighbor few doors down did not have any cables showing. Couple of weeks before Christmas the lights fell down, had to reach out for them to come out and re-install. To their credit they did come the following day. The lights fell down again few days ago which shattered on my porch and left glass on the ground, had to reach out to them again. At that point since it was after Christmas I asked for them to be removed. They showed up and with a pole they removed lights and clips but left three on the roof and left. Have sent them two messages asking why they left three clips on the roof when they should have removed all of them. They did not bother to reply.  All in all the lights did not look very good, as some did not even point in the same direction, and the cables were hanging. Definitely not as neat as i have seen elsewhere in other homes. It was a sloppy half-*** job that I paid way too much for. Now I also have to pay someone to remove the remaining clips. I most certainly would not recommend Torres Landscaping for lights install."

2,"Extremely disappointed in Torres and their customer service. Erick replaced our sod and some dead shrubs back at the end of March. He noted on his quote that there was a 90-day guarantee on the sod and that he would remain in contact with us during this time. I sent him pictures of dead sod a month ago that needed to be replaced; he responded that he would check it out after my second attempt of reaching him; however, I haven’t heard back from him for the last two weeks. Will consider changing this rating if he decides to contact me back and replace the dead sod."

5,"Sebastian and crew swiftly carved our mighty Red-Tip Photinia with the care and efficiency of seasoned surgeons. Over the course of nearly three hours, our 10-foot towering home to countless nests and shade source for our family and pets was reduced to mere fragmented splinters, erasing any existence of our erred planting 20 years ago.   We are so thankful to Sebastian's Concrete and Landscaping for a job well done."

3,"I offered them a project remotely. I think they did the work(I am still not sure), but the communication was lacking. So, I am still not sure how the place the looked like before or after. They sent me low-res videos via text messaging when I asked them for pictures (text messaging compresses videos). They took the project based on a high-res picture of a shrub, but implied that I misled them about the scope since shrub had three stems so it was 3 shrubs, like I should have counted the stems. I paid them in full, but I would not work with them again. They are probably hard-working people, but they are not professionals."

5,"These guys are amazing! We bought a house last year with a very neglected 1/3 acre lawn, and decided to tear out and replace the entire thing this spring. I received several quotes and theirs was very reasonable for the amount of work needed. Alex was super friendly and knowledgeable, and on the day of the project Juan and his team showed up on time and got right to work.   Between the three of them, they were able to completely tear out and replace an entire 1/3 acre lawn in TWO DAYS. This included scraping the existing grass and weeds, tilling, adding topsoil, laying and rolling sod, and rebuilding some flagstone paths that had been worn down into the dirt over the years. They even went above and beyond and tilled a few areas of unplanted flower beds that I had marked off in the back yard, and evened out the rock flower bed borders (making them look way better than I had been able to do on my own!). Everyone involved in this project was extremely nice and hard-working, and my new lawn looks so good that I've already had neighbors ask me for their card.   I will absolutely call these guys again the next time I need any kind of landscape service, and have already recommended them to neighbors."
5,Very knowledgeable about products & services.. Alex knows her stuff..Kudos!!! Love their work.. Punctuality was a HUGE plus.. I DO Recommend this company!!!
5,"I am very happy with my new lawn. they did an excellent job installing the sod. They also educated me on type of grass {St.Augustine], and to care for it. I highly recommend them for any landscaping needs. Bob H."
5,They were very professional and did a great job extending my flower bed. First mow and edging was done well. We are having J & A do our mow for the spring and summer season.
5,I had Bermuda grass 1700 sq in front yard and replaced it with st Augustine. The 4 guys were hard workers and thorough with the removal and tilling. The grass looks fabulous!!! Got a lot of compliments from neighbors and passerby people. Call these guys to do your next yard project :) :) :)
5,"We had a complete sod installation in our front yard. The price was very competitive to other quotes we received, and they were able to schedule us about a week after receiving our quote. The crew showed up on time and got it done in about 5 hours. They did a great job!"
5,"I was extremely pleased with this company. They gave me a quote for my yard and it was completed the next day. They were punctual and their customer service was excellent. The work they performed was great, it was a night and day difference. I would definitely use them again."
5,They did an outstanding job. Worked very hard all day to thin out
4,"Alex's team was efficient, got the job complete quickly and cleaned up afterwards even though they were not required to do so. Estimate was right for the job. Thank you. Will hire his team again."
4,"This review is for install of a French Drain. Job completed. It's been about one month now. I guess it works, as it has not rained much in my area. If you do not speak Spanish, the communication between Alex (female English speaker) and Juan is mediocre at best. I told Alex exactly what I was wanting and Juan had to start over on one section due to lack of communication. As well, I don't have a good feeling that he graded the drain appropriately. No screens were placed over the collectors to prevent mosquitoes. Had to do it myself. However, they did complete the job in one days time. They did allow me to make payments. That is the reason for the 4th star. For this particular type of job, next time, I'll look elsewhere."

The next day he texted me that he was running late which I thought was considerate of him. The mount I had my tv on had loosened from the wall and I needed Faris to reinstall it. I was having a hard time removing one of the preexisting screws from the mount in order for it to be reinstalled, which made me worry. Luckily once Faris arrived he was able to loosen and remove the troublesome screw, which I was extremely grateful and relieved for. After that, the reinstall went by quickly (15 minutes) and smoothly. Would highly recommend."
5,Faris responded quickly and asked for details and came prepared. I wanted the French cleats for my mirrors installed a little out of the ordinary and Faris made sure he understood before starting the project.

He communicated his delay within a reasonable timeframe. Will definitely contact Faris again!

He arrived on time, and worked quickly and efficiently. He had my picture hanging beautifully in no time! He even spared a few moments to give my obnoxious dogs some love...they were incredibly eager to meet him.

He is both crazy dog and curious cat friendly, a nice guy, and I think that the value for money is excellent. I will be recommending him to other people, because hanging pictures is a rare enough thing that nobody does it very well, at least in my experience. And, the next time I get new art, I’ll have him come diver to put it up. Great job."

5,Faris was easy to work with and communicative. I bought the wrong hardware and was able to get some additional work done around the house. Would recommend!
5,"Faris was kind, efficient, honest, and helpful. I had purchased the wrong TV mount initially and he walked me through ordering the correct one and then agreed to return to complete the project after it arrived. However, on the first visit, he was able to mount a different TV in another location, hang two heavy art pieces, and mount a cumbersome mirror on the wall, all within 1 hour. I was shocked how quickly he completed everything. His work is very professional and reasonably priced for his efforts."

5,"Faris was awesome! He arrived on time, very professional, did excellent work and was very reasonably priced. Highly recommend his services!"
5,This was by far the best experience I’ve had in booking a service to fix something at home. I got a the reply 5 mins after I requested and the tv was mounted and working 2 hours from when I reached out.   If you are looking to mount a tv or anything he is the person to reach out to! He is very careful about the holes he puts in the walls. He also comes with all the required tools and screws so that makes it easier!
5,"Faris did a good job with mounting my 55"" TV. He gave me some options for height since I was a bit indecisive. Very pleased with his work!"

We had an ample series of framed items that need to be hung, in some cases high up on stairwell walls, and he was patient, thoughtful, and offered up his opinions when asked. We'd love to have him back when we next have a need."
5,"Second time using Handy Bear. Does a great job, very fast and efficient, answers all your questions and knows how to get the job done rent!"

It was so clear he knows what he is doing, he took much less time than previous professionals we had used to hang things and really hung the items properly. Thank you Faris!"
5,"He installed a mantle mount over my fireplace. It looks great! He was fast and efficient, and was able to schedule me quickly."
5,"Handy Bear was able to install the television wall mount a day earlier than the initially schedule date. Once he arrived, he got to work right away. The installation took less than an hour with the television perfectly centered above the fireplace."
5,"We are very happy with how the final project turned out. He hung up a collage of photos and they were all even and looked great! The only thing wrong was that a few photos were placed in the wrong order than what I had showed him and I wish I had payed closer attention to correct it before the hole from the nail went in. But, even with that being said, it looks great! Definitely great pricing and was done quickly."
5,"Even though my wall mount kit was missing some screws, Faris was able to find the replacements and completed the mount. Highly recommended."

4,Very easy to coordinate a time and he arrived perfectly on time. He mounted my 55 in tv with a mantelmount with ease -- very clear he knew what he was doing and it took him an hour. Only small gripe is he didn't clean up after himself -- I had to erase the pencil marks he left on the wall and sweep up the drywall dust on the floor and mantle.
5,"We hired them to hang pictures - paintings, drawings, etc - in our place and could not have been happier with the work. Moreover, it was a pleasure to deal with them - they were responsive and punctual and the work was of the highest quality. I recommend them without reservation."

3,"Faris did the job he was hired to do which was mount a tv above a fireplace. The price was fair and he did the job fairly quickly. I was, however, very uncomfortable the whole time he was there. Among the first things he bothered to say to me after arrival was about the tv mount I bought, ""Where did you get this? Best Buy?"" I replied, ""Yes"". He said, ""It's no good."" So now the tone is set. I don't know exactly what he means - like, will it not work with the tv I bought? Should I halt the job and buy a different one? He just stares at me blank-faced and I have no idea what he means or what to say. It was so weird. I'm now completely uncomfortable in my home and don't know what to say to this comment so I leave the room and let him work. He then calls out to me to ask me how high I'd like the tv mounted. I asked him what most people do. He says, ""Different people like different places."" Okay fine - I point to a place on the wall, after he ASKS me where I want it and doesn't offer ANY guidance or suggestions, and he replies, ""That's too low."" Well thanks. You ask me where I want it, don't offer any help or suggestions, then tell me I'm wrong. Faris hung the tv as he was hired to do but I found the interpersonal interaction with him uncomfortable, weird, and awkward. The only time he talked to me, or acknowledged me, was to insult my purchase and tell me I was wrong. No, I cannot say I recommend him because I prefer to work with, and hire, people who don't make me uncomfortable and who make even the SMALLEST effort to be friendly and personable - especially when they're in your home doing work."

1,"He had amazing reviews, so not sure why we had a disconnect. As soon as I answered the door, he was not friendly. I explained that I needed a couple of shelving units anchored to the wall, but that I had previous issues with the sheetrock not holding heavy items. I asked if he was going to locate a stud and he said no, would use anchors. That was the issue I had when I did it myself. Sure enough…anchor would not stay in place. I stopped the work and gave him $40 and told him we were finished. Also…every time I spoke to him he looked at me like I did not know what I was talking about, kind of dismissive toward me. I considered that we might have a language barrier, but could tell by his responses and his English was very good. I can hang things myself by the hunt and peck method…make my own holes…do not need help with that. He did offer to patch his hole and I said no thanks."

1,This is a revised review --- I had given high stars to the service. I got the service done in late 20201...Within few weeks of the service my TV mount started to droop. I reached out to Faris to which he said when he comes around my area he will take a look and fix and gave me some tips to fix the TV mount. After multiple failed attempts i have been waiting since September of 2021. The story is still the same from this installer and now hes saying i gave you tips on what to do customer fix their own issues themselves. Which I think is the worst thing to say. I guess not all apples are shaped equally a true professional otherwise would go out of his/her way to satisfy the customer needs. But not this one lesson learned not hiring again!!!

"Ben Handy, Fully Insured"
5,"This review or for mounting and installation. I talked to Ben about four possible tasks that I needed done: 2 motion sensor solar panel light mounting, 1 door reinforcer installation, and 1 cabinet hinge repair. Initially, I asked if all four projects could be done in an hour. However, after our discussion, it sounded like it would take more than an hour, so I I asked Ben to prioritize the lights first to see how much he can do in an hour, which he agreed. Ben installed the two lights on a non-flat surface and on one of the lights, a difficult angle and reach. Ben used his own tools and I advised him to bring specialized tools, which I didn’t have, to drill into concrete, which I didn’t know how to do either. Ben did tactfully completed this task. Since I was satisfied, I decided to proceed with Ben’s services for the second hour to install the door reinforcer and fix the cabinet hinges. Ben and I strategized ways to install the door reinforcer. He used another special tool to remove the trim after taking measurements, and I suggested fasteners were better than the screws the manufactured provided. Ben already had a tray of different screws, including the fasteners, prepared. Ben installed the door reinforcer with the fasteners and tested it. He successfully accomplished this task. Third, Ben was able to easily fix the cabinet screws and now the cabinet works fine. Conclusion, Ben took 100 minutes of 120 minutes to finish all four tasks. Mathematically speaking, Ben finished the job 20 minutes faster and was 16% more efficient than I expected. In terms of efficacy, on a scale on 1-5, 5 being the best, I rate him a 5 out of 5. I highly recommend Ben on future projects.   Side note: Ben’s professional experience AND Bachelor’s AND Master’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering makes him standout as a"
5,Very Professional! He has done so many jobs on my properties since 2019 and I couldn’t ask for a better
5,"Great experience- Ben responded promptly and arranged to come fix my broken cabinet door the very next morning, even messaging an ETA a few minutes beforehand. My broken cabinet door was fixed within 90 minutes and I am very pleased. I would not hesitate to call again. Thank you!!!"
5,"Ben can do it all. Responsive, efficient, resourceful and willing to help with on the fly additional fixes! Will DEFINITELY be hiring him again in the future!"
5,"We had Ben come in to change the halogen recess lighting in our kitchen to led recess lights. Given that the halogen lights were low voltage, Ben inspected the lights and didn't unnecessarily rip out the transformer but tested and was able to install the new lights with the existing transformer. He also changed the outdoor lights for us and properly caulked them.  Given the high quality work he did on his first visit, we had him come in and hang 9 paintings in our house. A couple of them were really tricky to install (extremely high - 14ft+ and another required drilling through a duct).  Overall, we had a great experience with Ben and would hire him again. In addition to knowing his stuff, he is extremely courteous and professional to work with."

5,Ben did a great job mounting my Samsung Frame TV. He showed up in the expected timeframe and also was able to help out with another task on the spot for a reasonable fee. He did an excellent job on both projects. I appreciated his flexibility and helpfulness!
5,Ben was great to work with. he was helpful and spoke to me about how the work was being done. He was also flexible with his time and made sure he did as much as he could do from the list of items we wanted to get done. Will definitely work with him again!
5,"The workmanship and componentry looks very sound. Also, his demeanor was very courteous and professional. Plus quick response as well!   I definitely recommend him to others."
5,"Ben came prepared with the tools to do what ever was required. It was a small job, but not an easy one and required some creative thinking. Ben is a very pleasant person to work with and I will definitely use him again. He may not be the cheapest rate, but he is very intelligent and knows what he’s doing."
5,"Ben was great, very responsive and kept us updated throughout the process. He fixed the light and also helped snake the plumbing. Would recommend!"
5,"Ben did a wonderful job assembling and installing heavy-duty industrial shelving in my garage, including attaching them to the studs so they can’t ever tip over. Not the simple task you might imagine, because neither the floor nor the walls were level or straight, so he had to fashion wood spacers to make them level and secure. Great job, and a lovely guy."
5,Ben was great to work with. Very flexible and knowledgeable. Fixed our main issue efficiently and also did a few other things I asked him if he could do on the spur of the moment!
5,He replaced a garbage disposal and changed some outdoor lighting. He was efficient and punctual. I will call him for future projects.
5,"Ben had outstanding workmanship, and was an excellent communicator. I sprung a leak, and Ben promptly communicated & was able to have everything fixed in a matter of hours from when I first reached out. He fixed exactly what I was hoping to have completed, and had great quality of work."
5,"Ben was way late, but he’d agreed to do the job the same day, since he was so booked the next several days. Once he got here, he went right to work. The job was, in his own words, “a nightmare”, but he persevered. He’s kind of expensive, but I really needed his help. The job, putting pedal extenders on my car’s brake and gas pedals, was difficult because of the pair I’d selected: they were inexpensive and, I’d been warned, not at all easy to put on. He got the job done and I’m very pleased. I used them for the first time today and I felt safe and they seemed very secure and on the exact right spot for me to drive comfortably and safely."
5,Ben was super quick to respond and was at my house within 30 min for some light kitchen repair. He did an awesome job. Would highly recommend.
5,"Ben is a true professional and did incredible work installing a new kitchen faucet and all our Google Home products. He is flexible, communicates well and does quality work - always going the extra mile!"
5,"Ben repaired some sliding closet doors so that they glide very smoothly. Even with some underlying uneven construction that made the job very difficult, he persisted and made it work – good as new."
5,"Hired Ben once, since then can’t work with any other"
5,Ben did a great job for us. We had three small jobs that each had something tricky about them - he figured each one out calmly and patiently and finished the job with skill and efficiency. We will definitely hire him again!

5,"Ben Handy is absolutely outstanding! From start to finish, I contacted him to get a quote for a few small things around my house. I sent them some pictures regarding the projects to be done, he contacted me extremely fast with a reasonable quote. I supplied material that I got on my own from Home Depot, but he mentioned that he can also get the materials for you. We made a 9 am appointment and he showed up 10 min early (8:50 am). He wore his mask, did prep at the start, and clean up at the end, all-and-all, he finished 3 little jobs within 2 and half hours. Very impressive & I highly recommend Ben Handy for your home & business repairs, & installation."
1,"Updating this review to terrible because of the following issues.   Ben Fixed a broken door in an emergency and I hired him for more work.   We hired him to fix a leak in the ceiling, some locks, and seal a toilet and didn't do a good job and charged us a lot.  We are trying to start our bar business back up after the pandemic.   We arranged to meet at the venue at 9am. He showed up at 2pm because he was hungover from drinking the previous night.  After arriving he said he needed to shop for parts. He took an excessive amount of time to shop and look for parking because he was hungover. He continued to charge us $100/hour for this extremely slow shopping time.  His patching of the ceiling is unprofessional and half baked. See the pictures. We are hiring a new contractor to fix this botched job.  He is ok for quick repairs that take one hour or less.  But do not hire him for large jobs. He will rip you off"

5,Pedro and his team performed miracles for me. My home purchase was on hold due to repair work needed and two days later he was already starting repairs. Completed within two days and looks perfect! Today I received the approval to move forward . I will definitely use him again and will recommend to others..
5,"was very pleased with the quality of work and how quick and efficient they were, will hire them again for other projects"
5,They gave me a great price on painting my deck and my entire house . They helped me picked up colors for the house and it came out so beautiful after all the painting was done. They found a problem with the holes in my house and they help me solve the problem Plus they pointed out the my gutters were dirty . They provided me with excellent service . They were friendly and nice . Plus they were busy with other clients and I like how they were able to fit me in their busy schedule. I like their service so much I hired them again for another project in august. I will refer all my friends and family . I have been getting so many compliments about the color of my house and now it feels like a brand new how . I’m so in love with it thank you again.
5,Pedro and his crew were on time did a great job and the work looks awesome. I’m just glad I didn’t have to get on the roof and climb 24’ ladders to do this.
5,"Affordable Painting Services did an excellent job touching up a few spots on my house. Adees and his painter were quick, professional and as the name states, affordable. I will definitely use his company again for other paint jobs big or small. Thank you!!"
5,"Pedro and his team are professional, respectful and very flexible. They did a fabulous job and did the job they bid. They’re very affordable and adjusted to some last minute changes and requests. I highly recommend them. When every other request for a bid was turned down or ignored, Pedro followed through and provided a timeline that he stuck to. I love the whole job he and his men did."
5,"Pedros and team did an exceptional job on our multiple painting projects. We appreciated the thorough prep involved and the results are amazing. We've had neighbors comment how great our ""new"" home looks and have shared Pedros contact info. I definitely recommend him and the team and will continue to be a referral source."
5,Everything looks good. They showed up when they said they would and quality is what was expected. Thank you very much for doing the job in the truncated time frame we had with all of the other projects we were trying to work around
5,"Pedro and his team did a great job repairing extensive dry rot around our house, replacing all our gutters and downspouts, and painting. They were responsive to questions and changes and their prices were reasonable. We will definitely use them again."
5,Pedro painting is a very professional company that do excellent work. The paint they use is high quality. I recommend Pedro painting to everyone who wants a excellent product.
5,Pedros team provided excellent craftsmanship. The work was great. We had the whole house interior painted and floors installed. We plan to them return in the spring to paint the outside of the house.
5,Needed a quick job done for home closing repairs. Pedros responded same day and came out next day for a quote. It was very fair and priced right. Came a day earlier and got the job done. Repairs passed inspection. Thanks for saving us!!
5,Pedros and his crew did an excellent job painting our garage floor with epoxy product and garage walls plus ceiling with semi gloss paint. We are very happy with the outcome and would highly recommend his professional service.  Since we did both tasks he gave us a discounted price for the combined job. His crew thoroughly power wash the floor then come back the next day to finish both tasks in the same day. We also like the flexibility to go to a paint store and select the color of wall paint we like. Pedros picked up the paint. Paint cost is included in his quoted price. He gave us specific instruction to wait 3 days for the epoxy to fully cure before parking cars in the garage. The treated floor does not attract dirt and it’s such a pleasure to work in the garage now. We’re glad to have made the investment. Very worthwhile!
5,We are very satisfied with the work done in our garage. From the wall paint to the epoxy floors. I highly recommend them.
5,"Great, quality work! I got estimates from several other places, and they were the best option for the services I requested. They even finished ahead of schedule. I’m definitely keeping them in mind for any future home projects."
5,Pedros team provided excellent craftsmanship. The work was great. We had the whole house interior painted and floors installed. We plan to them return in the spring to paint the outside of the house.
5,"Pedro was prompt and provided excellent communication during our interactions. I'm very happy with the paint and epoxy job he and his workers did, he also provided excellent value. I will definitely reach out to him again if I need more paint work in the future."
5,Great painters and epoxy. Had my garage epoxied and it looks great and is far more functional. A hard worker and a man of his word.
5,Very responsive
5,"If only thumbtack gave us the options to select it all, we would! Hire them! It's affordable meets quality. They're very professional and kind. Always kept us in the loop of the entire process. Thank you for everything. We love our new garage."
5,"Professional, hard working, and diligent and completed as bid. Friendly and accommodating. Would recommend to family and friends. Before and after photos show the beautiful work by Pedro and his crew. Thank you Pedro, we are very happy!"
4,"Work was great and the floor looks awesome. My only disappointment was a clear coat was not part of the deal, but everything else was really good. They worked quickly and efficiently."
5,Pedros house painting did a wonderful job on my exterior house painting. The price was very good and the prep and painting was finished in 2 days . The paint used was marquee BEHR and the coverage is excellent. Pedro is very polite. He gave me a quote quickly after looking at my house and asking what I wanted. He put me on his schedule and started the day I expected and finished quicker than I expected. My house looks beautiful.

The shed looks great and my wife is happy we have lots of time to decorate before the event. Thank you for the fast and professional job!! I highly recommend them, very friendly and professional."
5,"He did an amazing job and in a pinch! Honest and straightforward, would definitely use him again."
5,Great work! Took time to complete the project right and matched the paint to the stucco work perfectly. Highly recommend Perdro’s house painting.
5,Pedro and team were rock solid. They were super awesome and responsive. The value was amazing and we love our garage!
5,Did a great job doing epoxy painting for our garage area. They were very responsive and on time!
2,"Adees was fast and responsive, but color chips came off after mopping the floor first time. To his credit, he offered a fix, which I rejected due to my experience on other project with him.  Thing to know, it is most basic epoxy treatment. No leveling, or repairs of the concrete of any kind. They had just applied ""Rust-Oleum EpoxyShield 2.5-Car Garage Floor Kit"" available at Home Depot for $134.  Paintwork on walls/ceiling is good at least."
5,"These painters were willing to fit us in during a very busy time. They worked 12 hours to do the job. We would hire them again, no question about it."
5,n/a

Its complete and I am so happy that I used Thumbtack/Pedro for this project."

5,Pedro did a fantastic job meeting my schedule as I was in mid-move and he completed the work with quality while I was moving. I definitely recommend Pedro’s painting.
5,Pedro was quick to respond with a quote and extremely professional. He came over to look at the job and communicated what time he’d be coming and showed up ON TIME! He then set an appointment with me to do the work the following week and again reached out a day prior to confirm. The day of the job him and his crew showed up on time again and worked quickly and professionally. The job turned out great and he made sure we were happy with it before he left. I’d absolutely recommend him and we will definitely use him in the future.

5,"I had a living room, dining room and 2 hallways to be painted. The results were fantastic, it took a lot less time than I expected. They were very helpful and kept me updated step by step as the work progressed. I definitely recommend them."
5,I highly recommend using this company! The communication is great as he responds promptly. He is flexible with your schedule and stands behind his work. There was another coat needed for our job and he came back to make sure it was to our satisfaction. I plan on using him for future projects as he is reasonable with his prices.
5,Did a great job on our rv garage and two car garage
5,"I had an ugly dark stain on my stucco house. Pedro’s House Painting helped me understand what needed to be done to get rid of the stain. We made an appointment and in a very short time , he came and painted over the very large stain, and now the stain is gone."
5,I had 2 painters cancel on me while I was in the process of moving out of my condo. Pedros House Painting was prompt with their response and was able to paint my black wall quickly and efficiently. I will be using them again and recommending to friends & family.
5,"Pedros was professional, high quality work. He went above and beyond and installed bead board and trim that looked beautiful. I would hire again in a second!"
5,"He was very communicative and thorough, which made for an job so well done that it met all our expectations. Hi requested a walk-through at the end, with a crew on hand ready to respond right then to anything we may have found.  His excellent communication skills and thoroughness at the beginning gave us the confidence that he was going to be so throughout.  During the initial walk through, he was seeing the same types of things that we were in areas pertaining to dry rot, and he asked very specific questions as to trim paint style preferences. He definitely gave us confidence that he was going to do a good job, and the end product proved to be great!"
5,"Pedros did a great job for me. I shopped around for painters and he was very reasonable. He was very helpful, arrived when he said he would and the quality of his work was excellent. I would certainly recommend him and plan to have him paint the outside of my house as well."
5,"Had three rooms for painting over bright colors, and a tight schedule. The painters worked with my schedule and had good contact with me. Job well done."
5,"Pedros and a team of two guys showed up EARLY to the job and finished in 1/3 of the time it should have taken! They were so good, they didn't even remove light plate covers or tape around curtain brackets and there's not a speck of paint anywhere it shouldn't be! I would highly recommend Pedros and his team."
5,"Pedro was an all around great painting professional. His price was very reasonable, showed up on time each day, did a professional paint job and was very responsive to our questions. I highly recommend Pedro's Painting."
5,"Pedros and helper did a great job for me taking care of some drywall and putting in a new landing pad wood piece under the sink. They also gave me free sealant for another issue. They were friendly, hard working and helpful and good quality work. I will use them again. Thanks Pedros!"
5,Pedros did an amazing job fixing my floors. He was very good at matching a broken floor board that was now discontinued. He also touched up the paint in my house and did it all for a very low price. I will definitely use him again in the future.
5,"Stop your search here. Pedro is a genuine guy and exactly who you are looking for. Most competitively priced, top-notch quality. He went above and beyond, we could not be happier with the results. Very customer-oriented. You will be thankful too."
5,Pedros House Painting did a good job of repairing my wood rot and repainting sections of the exterior of the home. He was affordable and quick. Did a good clean up upon request at the end. Very nice young man and wants to please his customers.
5,"Pedros House Painting was a pleasure to work with. He was very accommodating with his schedule, showed up on time and did a clean professional job at a reasonable price.   As a interior designer I have many years of experience with painters. I definitely recommend Pedros and hope to use him again."
5,"Pedros responded quickly and quoted me a fair price for interior house painting. Even with other changes needed when he arrived, the price didn't change, work quality was on point, completed quickly, and professionally written up. Definitely recommend!"
5,"We asked Pedros Painting to paint cabinets in a rental kitchen. He removed the cabinets and sanded and painted them. Came out amazing. Before and After pics posted. We asked Pedros Painting to paint the outside of the front of the building. He and his crew did an excellent job in replacing rotted siding and painting. He painted the inside walls of the front unit of our duplex, which came out excellent. He performed a full paint of the entire rental unit in the back of our duplex and did a good job! He is responsive, on time and offers great value. We were very happy with all the work he did for us. The last picture is Adees with paint on his teeth, hair and face. He is not afraid of hard work. He also communicates with the customer along the way to make sure everything is what the customer wants. At the end of the job, he again calls the customer to check on the work and he does more touch up so that the customer is happy. Thank you Adees!"
5,Pedros came in and replaced my broken toilet. He did the job earlier than scheduled and the work was done very professionally. I'm happy to recommend his skillset anywhere as a contractor.
5,Pedros was phenomenal. He did an excellent job painting my whole house. He has an eye for details. Took care of the mov and accomplished the job in timely manner with a great attitude. I defintkey recommend Pedros and will hire again.
5,"Perfect job, clean covered everything, made sure I was happy with the final product, goes out of his way to make sure every thing is done and on time. Great listener."
5,"I found Mr. Pedro’s Ad in Thumbtack, Gave him a call to come over and see how much would he charge me to paint my kitchen cabinets, once he came by and looked that it and he gave me a good price to paint them, so I agreed to it ! And I wanted it to be legit, so they give me a year warranty and they are licensed too !  And my kitchen Cabinets look amazing after the job was done !  I will definitely recommend them to my friends and family members !"
2,He charged over $600 for 4 hrs work. He claimed to be $30/hr.
5,A job done well. Pedros was really responsiveness and did a great and timely job for my garage epoxy floor.
5,"We are very pleased with Pedro and his crew. They did a great job, We will be using them again for other projects!"
5,They take their work seriously and was professional and responsive.
1,"I called Pedro for a consultation. He was friendly enough on the phone and even made an appointment to come to my house. I waited, but he never showed up. No phone call, no message, just didn't show. Horrible way to conduct business"
4,Pedros arrived as scheduled & was super reliable & was responsive to the areas that needed special attention. Thanks Pedros for doing the job so quickly.
4,Pedro’s crew was always punctual and professional. They had to re-schedule a few days due to weather and finishing other jobs so the entire project took a week. They addressed touch up and siding repair concerns as we asked because the first attempt at repairing siding did not look complete. Overall quality of the paint coverage was good.
4,I like Pedros as a company. But one frustration was scheduling the appointment for an estimate at dusk. As a result the paint we selected was not correct and I was stuck for an additional $70 charge because they bought the wrong shade of paint. It seems to me he stuck me with extra paint that he said he couldn't return. Generally the job was well done.

4,"Very good communication with Pedros, on time and quick to respond always. Starting out first day power washer broke, no work that day. After that seemed like the project (painting exterior) was in a bit of a hurry, as expected. Painting got done by Pedro and his helper. When clean up touch up and walk through came, Pedro's helper went to Russia for two weeks leaving Pedro alone with no other helper. I had changed a color on a couple doors so Pedro had to make time to get that done hurriedly so some minor areas were overlooked (he had to go to another job). I understand that this is a hard business to find employees. This is not a team of workers. I did appreciate Pedros expertise in recognizing dry rot and repair."
4,"We liked working with Pedros. He was efficient and got the job done quickly.   My only suggestion is to make sure they spot clean a bit, as some paint was left on our floors that I had to clean after. However, I feel if I would of caught it earlier they would of fixed it."
4,Pedros house painting was very quick with the estimate and the work. The price was reasonable and I was very satisfied with the work.
1,Never showed up on date he said he would be there. Gave us a lowball offer….and won’t answer the phone or texts! Waste of time! Do not use!!! Fraud alert!!!
5,Quick and professional job. Well done!
5,Best price in the area and great service !
4,House looks great!
1,Absolutely not honest in his estimating and pricing process. I do not recommend this
5,Very nice and on time. Great value. Will definitely use Pedro's house painting in the future.
5,Love there work.
3,"Quick to respond. Came to do work in 5 days. I was told to buy 2 gallons of paint, used only 1/2 gallon. $40.00 a gallon. Lots of running drip marks on the wall where too much paint was put on. Daughter and I went in after they left and fixed approx 20 areas of drips. Very good about cleaning up after working. Very nice, polite fellows."
5,"Fabulous! Precise, professional and dependable with reasonable rates. We will use them again!"
3,"WOULDNT USE THEM AGAIN. bad trimming job, paint on floors,blinds,windows, door knobs,windowsill, hinges, paint on side stairs bad trimmings,there's too many touch up thats needed,running paint, paint on boarders, missed areas. paint the flat walls ok. I'm Done.  AP...You're such a liar. Please dont lie! You know DANG well You had no furniture to move around!! You did a sloppy bad paint job. I paid you over$2,400 and you wasnt worth that believe that!.A lesson learn.  The $300 owed to you. you were going to be paid. I was so displeased with your work and altitude. I asked for receipt didnt want give that to me when I made my payment. Told me company send me receive. Dont know who your customers are that they will pay you without receiving a receipt. We went back and forward with that until I said wasnt giving you the check until get a receipt right then and there. We did a paper handwritten receipt. You wasnt worth the $300 but it was going be paid. I didnt want give you full amount owed because I was so disappointed and I knew I had to get some6else come and redo your mess. You're the one that said give to me as a gift. So why would I not accept! I didnt want to see you. ask for address to send payment to you. Told you I looked up your company and you said I had wrong one. some reason you didnt want me to contact the company you work thru. Anyway I have moved on and gotten over it.   JUST DONT LIE ON YOUR CUSTOMERS ): YOU JUST DID A BAD JOB. AND SOME OF YOUR OTHER REVIEWS SIMILAR TO MY EXPERIENCE):"
5,Amazing and fair pricing! Understands your needs.
3,"Very friendly and responded to messages quickly. However, the work was sloppy. Sent msg and pics. No response. Work does not show like he is a professional painter. I would not recommend."
5,Friendly. Very personal. Good prices and beautiful and professional job. Will hire again for whole house painting
5,"Great Experience. Super fast, reliable, great communication, and the did exactally what they said they would do."
4,"I need a job done quickly, Pedros was able to get the supplies needed and complete the task on a holiday!"
5,"The team arrived on time, got right to work, did an excellent job and finished early."
5,Pedros house painting did a professional job. Very clean work & attention to detail.
5,"Awesome job painting my vaulted ceilings, fast friendly and affordable service."
5,Very punctual and professional with completing my house’s door paint project
5,Easy to communicate with and did a great job pressure washing my Duplex. Thanks!

4,"Exterior paint looks great, thanks for the suggestions on color. Recommended."
4,We had a great experience and will definitely be booking again! Thank you.
4,My house looks fine. Pedros and his crew did a good job.
4,"Pretty good painter, left some over spray on the black color we had to clean up"
4,Pedro's was always on time. I would recommend him! Not immaculate but worth the price. They are more than fair!
4,Very thorough and courtesy of my time frame requested. Did a great job on both my garages.
4,Showed up on time. Worked hard. Fair pricing. Thanks Mr. Pedros!
4,"Pedros responded quickly, gave a good price and showed up on time and had adequate quality."
4,He will be painting my bathroom this coming Sat. Can't rate his work until it is complete.
2,"Price was fair, response was fast. Downside, left several unpainted spots, didn’t mask so our wood floors have splatter around the entire house, light fixtures. Doesn’t cut with masking so it’s that soft line from your base to walls. Preference, but in a lot of areas just looks lazy and incomplete. I’ve got a high walk in the staircase that absolutely needed another coat. You see the white coming through the yellow he painted. A rail wall completely missed painting right in the middle about 1/4 of it. He took all the blinds down, then after saying he’d put them all back up left most of them down. A week later I’m still putting blinds back up and cleaning up after him. He won’t respond to my text since he got paid. Not confident I would use him again. Maybe in a pinch if I’m desperate. Just too many cut corners and seems to not care after the project to make anything right."
2,"Pedro painted our home in August. And to be fair he did a good paint job (except the front door, see picture) BUT......He was planning on painting the outside of our home, our bathroom vanity and our master bedroom. After he finished the outside and wanted to be paid for that apart of the job (which we happily did) he claimed he had to leave the state for his brothers wedding and would call the beginning of Sept to do the inside. After not hearing from him, I had to text to ask when he would return, I was then told his grandfather was sick in the hospital and to please wait for him. I waited a few more weeks and decided to go on this thumbtack app to contact him. To my surprise I find 3 new reviews for jobs in Sept!!! Wow! Why not tell me he had bigger jobs to do and I should find someone else instead of lying?? I now have to hire someone else. Here is a picture of the front door he painted. Opps missed a spot! Grrrr To Pedro....being honest could have very well saved you from a bad review!"
2,"Appointment was not kept by Pedros. Blamed me for the problem..... Did not keep initial appointment time and then was on the other side of town, when it was time to get together.  Did call and phone not available, but still not adapt at time management w/ appts."
2,"Spoke to them to discuss what I needed, and they told me they would call back in a couple of hours to set up an estimate. I never received a call back. I used the plumber that installed my toilets originally."
2,"He was rushed and quickly unmasked his tape, leavings lots of problem areas that never cured. He came back the next day for touch up, but you can only do so much with torn parts."
3,No follow thru. Once he was paid ‘no response to our requests for itemized receipt!
2,Tried to cancel start date. Agreed to work 1/2 days. Not prepared
1,1.Complete the project  2. Refund client’s money ($50) for not painting mantle and leaving paint.
2,Not that professional looking job messed up my floors blinds n took forever even tho it shuda been 6 days
5,Great work and finished early. I recommend them.
5,Very honest and Fair. Good workmanship
1,Repeatedly scheduled times with me then never showed up. Only let me know that he wasn't going to make it after I text him asking him to confirm that he was still coming. Would not recommend using him.
1,This guy does not display professionalism. He wanted the appointment to be in the middle of the day on a Sunday. I called him in the morning to verify appointment and left a voicemail which he didn’t return. I drove a distance to meet him at the house and 40 minutes before appointment he sent a message through thumbtack asking to change appointment. This guy is not very friendly either.
1,"i wouldn't recommend! WHAT an experience.. hire this contractor after being told when he would start only to be told two days later he forgot about me! Me being a developer/owner conveyed to pedro that's very unprofessional.. he seems to got offended and said now he couldn't do the job! wow .. wish i would have known this before hand, in my business time is money. big mistake."
1,He came to my house for a free estimate to paint some rooms in my house and he had an opportunity to see what s to paint and gave me the quote. Then over the phone he changed the quotes becuz of doors to paint on. He was here to see everything that needed to be painted on and he changed the quotes becuz of the doors. When I decided to reduce the number of rooms for him to paint due to high cost of the work. He technically did not reduce much to the point where I realize he is not reliable with the price. Thanks to him for his effort.
1,Was supposed to come at 7 am to paint one bathroom   Never showed. Called and he said he had to finish another job . Said he left message but did not on my home phone or cell.
1,The quotes price was 1/3 of any other quote and the time estimated was half of others. This lead me to believe they didn't know the job like other pros. They also refused to give a license number after I requested it. (Even though they claimed to be licensed) I would be hesitant to hire this company.

5,Reza was amazing! He called me to confirm that he actually would be 30 minutes early and then completed the entire job within 20 minutes. He also gave me some great advice for another project we were planning on doing. Would definitely hire him again.

5,The individual dispatched was great and explained the process as he was doing it.

5,I will absolutely be calling FixTman again. They texted me when they were about 20 min away. Assembled my desk within an hour which is why I hired them in the first place. We tried putting together another desk and took us over 2 1/2 hours. Well worth it!

He had a last minute cancelation and my desk just happened to show up the other day. So it was meant to be.  He was done in an hour and I couldn't be happier with his work. The desk is put together correctly and I can move on with setting everything up.   Thank you!

5,Mehrdad from FixTman was great. He did a fantastic job assembling our outdoor dining table and chairs. He was very easy to work with. Thanks.
5,My experience started off with a delightful conversation with Veronica who gave me useful information to see how FixTman ranked against the other pros on Thumbtack. This was also at 1am. I was given a honest and fair price and was told a rough step by step process of what would happen. I was informed that the employees follow Covid 19 proto calls and are vaccinated (not that I cared by some people do). I was also given pictures of previous installs. They were even able lucky for me to fit me in same day.   I received an appointment reminder and sent a contract to sign with a firm price. Later in the day I received a reminder of the appointment and Mehrdad (tech) sent a message and kept communication about the time he would arrive. He arrived and took very careful care of our television. He was following all Covid 19 protocols when he arrived. In the contract it said I would need to help him move the television because of the side. The over all install took less then an hour and then we placed it on the mount were he secured it. After it was mounted he tested the television for functionality and everything was great.  If you have small babies or pets I recommend they go to another room while the the bolt is screwed into the wall as it is loud. After Mehrdad finished I paid the invoice that had been sent in a text and all was great. Mehrdad was courteous and professional throughout the encounter.   The office followed up after the install to make sure everything went awesome. All tips go directly to installer. Thanks for an awesome experience FixTman.
5,"Mehrdad is very skilled, he assembled my TV stand following the menu quickly; there’s no menu on how to setup lights, he was able to figure out to complete the setting. Definitely recommend his service."
5,We requested assistance with setting up our treadmill. He came and set it up for us within a reasonable amount of time. He kept a clean workspace and took proper COVID precautions. I would recommend him.
5,Reza did an amazing clean job to install my recessed fireplace and even purchased extra wood to cover the inset as it was cut big. They took time to measure everything and do a clean job.

I was REALLY happy with the service - they were quick to respond, showed up on time, were highly professional, and were flexible when we changed our minds a couple of times. I would recommend them and will be hiring them again for another round of hanging and fixing in the future."
5,"I contacted FixTman LLC on Friday afternoon about assembling a desk and gaming chair, and they booked two guys for the next morning at 9. They showed up on time, were totally professional and very nice, and did a great job. An hour later the job was done and it was perfect. They also made sure that I understood how to put the monitor on the desk and the features of the chair. I would absolutely book them again."
5,Shervin was on time and got the job done quickly. I appreciated that he checked in with me at different points to make sure it was how I wanted it.
5,Helped me installed wall mounted speed bag for boxing. Response was quick and I got scheduled on the second day to get the work done. Installation is professional. Would like to see the crew to offer some cleanups after installation to make overall experience even better
4,I needed two bath room vanities assembled. I reached out and within a couple of hours had a quote and appointment booked. On the day of the appointment they arrived within the window they said and with little instruction quickly assembled the vanities. They both looked great and saved us a ton a time if we had to do it on our own. I would definitely use them again.
4,I had a tricky tv mounting job that I wanted done quickly. FixTman responded quickly and arrived within an hour. After a few hiccups the technician made it work. Would use them again.
5,"The technicians did a great job. My tv and sound bar look beautiful, the cords are well concealed and they were punctual. Good quality, highly recommend!"
4,Installation went great. There was a miscommunication between dispatcher and the tech on the cable concealing product the former recommended I should have prior to the job and the latter rejected to install.
5,Needed help with a bed assembly with a short turn around time. Very responsive and professional! Really appreciated Farshad's attention to the details and verifying everything was working.

5,"Mehrdad did an excellent job today installing the legs to our small sofa. He was punctual, professional and efficient (took only 30 minutes and was extremely courteous with throwing away the packaging/wrapping). My sofa is sturdy and looks amazing! Will use this company again for future services."
4,"Overall a good experience. The only complaints that I have are that the installer kindly helped me by picking up the tv from the store, but I was never informed that there would be a $50 charge to drive a couple of miles and putting the tv in his truck. Also, I thought that paying to put the cords behind the wall included the necessary equipment to do the job, not having to go to the store to pick up the items. Otherwise, everything else was fine, I just wish that the communication was better."
5,A FixTMan crew came and mounted 3 TVs in my home. They were fast and worked clean. They even handled a difficult task of mounting over a marble slab Fireplace.
5,"First, FixTman was incredibly responsive to all my requests and my need to reschedule. I felt like I was able to reach them anytime of the day or night, which is really rare. Then, the day of service, the person sent was extraordinarily qualified to do any number of chores. He assembled a bed for me in record time,was conscious about cleaning up after himself, took pride in his work and had a great attitude. He also hung a couple of pictures for me with great precision. He noticed me struggling with a couple of chores around the house, and volunteered to lend a hand. You can't ask for much more than that! At the end, the invoice reflected exactly what was quoted."
5,Reza and his co-worker were incredible! They were very professional and assembled my 2 entertainment centers in a quick and efficient manner. Many thanks to FixTman (Bay Area). Call them!
4,Hired FixTman recently to wall mount 3 TVs. Got a quote and appointment within minutes upon my inquiry. Rate was good and the tech that came out was professional and quick. Would definitely hire again.
5,Very professional and cordial. My new exercise equipment was perfectly put together. I tried the exercise machine later that day. Works great. Would highly recommend!
5,"I would have chosen all five: quality, professionalism, responsiveness, value and punctuality. I would recommend this company to everyone. I'm looking forward to hiring them for future projects. They are a total package of excellence."
5,My appointment with the Fixtman was on Tuesday but they called me on Monday and said they could do the job earlier if I wanted. My Monday suddenly became free so I agreed and they were at my door in less than half an hour.  Their quote was less than other companies once they found out the tv mount was already on the wall and I just needed someone to attach the tv to it. They are quick to respond and make sure any issues are worked out. I’m pleased with their service and professionalism.
5,"We needed an IKEA diaper table to be set up immediately. After approaching FixTman, they promptly provided a booking the very next day. The technician was able to fix and set up the table for us within an hour. He assembled the furniture carefully without any damage.

5,"FixTman assembled an IKEA dresser for me. Shervin was a total expert - he not only did a great job with the dresser itself, but he also adjusted our closet’s sliding doors so that we were able to put the over-sized dresser into the closet. I would love to hire him again."
4,"Special kudos for their ability accommodate my request to advance the appointment by a week. Technician arrived on time and was professional. However, he took longer than expected due to the furniture assembly instructions and had to redo some of the steps."

It’s not actually centered on the wall which confused me at first, but I realized was because of the metal stud placement in the wall and they did a good job of finding a place to hang it. Just moved stuff under the tv to “center” it so it’s all good. Very polite, knowledgeable, and quick install thanks guys! Company has very fast, informative responses - I booked the night before and had maybe 10 back and forths total from inquiry to invoice, customer service is totally on it and makes sure you have what you need."

They charged $130 which is much higher than I expected. But their service was flawless.
5,"I engaged FixTman LLC to mount 2 TVs in my house.  Right from the word go, they were very professional, straightforward, and responsive in their communication.

Farivar reached on time and did a great job mounting both the TVs. Throughout my appointment window, Farvivar was very respectful and approachable.

5,"I hired FixTman L.L.C. To hang 10 or more pictures/artwork on my walls in my 1 bedroom condo in SanMateo at the Lauriedale Condominiums. I looked online and found Thumbtack, an app that has several top pros who hang artwork/pictures. We communicated with each other by sending messages to each other to set up a time frame and date for the work to take place. FixTman was very highly rated by people who had used his services and had been very satisfied with the quality of the work. We settled for a several hour time frame for the work to be done and I was instructed to put the artwork in front of the wall it/they were to be hung on. I placed the pictures in my bedroom, oh I I groom,dining area, kitchen,bathroom and bathroom vanity area. FixTman sent two young men who were top rated Pros with excellent reviews from past customers. The workers arrived on time and were very pleasant and polite and after checking what they needed to do they worked quietly and diligently to hang my various artwork where I had specified I wanted it hung. The Pros worked cooperatively with each other and asked me if they needed anything   clarified. They completed hanging all the pictures within the agreed upon time frame. They did a great job and cleaned up as they completed hanging each picture and the condo was very neat when they finished the job within the allotted time frame. I was in my bed room out of their way so they could work with out interruptions and they were very quiet and respectful of me and I hardly felt that they were here. They did a neat and excellent job and deserve a great review of a five star rating. If I need additional work done I would not hesitant to hire them again and recommend them to my friends and family members without hesitation.

He came earlier than expected (a plus for me) and knew exactly what he was doing! He was fast and efficient and did so much better than the last people I hired. I’m really happy and will definitely be using them in the future. Great price also, book them! You won’t be disappointed."
5,The team arrived on the dot for my appointment and completed the work (with some additional asks i had) in less than 45 minutes. I was super impressed! Everything was done with care and they were very kind.

4,"I had great experience working with FixTman LLC. When I requested the quote they were one of the very few teams who sent the complete details. Also there were real good photos on thumbtack so that I could be little bit more confident on their work. The technician was very punctual . I provided a slot 1-3 .

3,"The associate turned up on time and was collegiate and friendly. He was helpful in moving the beds to the right room and was knowledgeable with the furniture and instructions. He pointed out that the material was not great, which was a good insight.   However when he was putting and moving one of the bed the floor was scratched. It would have been useful to come with a sheet to cover the floor or he could have asked us for one. Photos attached.  So overall no issues about the assembly. I would recommend they are mindful of the floors when assembling furniture as some wooden floors can get scratched."
5,Came on time and did the work in an hour. Will recommend
5,Very good service! I am very happy with the TV installation. Will hire again!

If the wall has metal stud, $25 extra, to stick a small cable concealer is $45 (it will usually cost couple of dollars ) And I would have appreciated if they adviced me on the placement of the tv.  After they mounted I had to hire another handy man to lower it as I was getting neck pain. The new handy man stuck painters tape and visualized how the tv would like.  I would expect similar professionalism from these folks but in reality they were in a much hurry. They spend like 30 mins and left in hurry. Not worth the price and hassle"

OLD REVIEW Tv was mounted too low, and off center. They blamed the mount and the outlet (possible - but I wouldn’t have mounted it at all had I known, would have bought a new mount).   Tv was also damaged. Can’t blame these guys directly (who knows).   But - getting a replacement tv, and forced to get it remounted due to bad job by these guys."

5,EXCELLENT Pro put my IKEA bed together fast and flawlessly.
3,"Surprisingly I did not have a very good experience with FixTman, but I want to note they did give a lot of opportunity to make things right.   It all starts when I reached out when the time window of arrival was closing, and I was never contacted about the technician being late and I had to reach out myself. Ultimately, I had waited the entire time and didn't get any update on when the technician would arrive until well after the time window had passed. They were understanding and apologetic, saying this never happens (unfortunately it did for me). Real professionalism I would have expected them to contact me if there were schedule issues, at the very least. They gave me a slight discount for the troubles, and genuinely wanted to make up for it, so I do appreciate that. Finally, about 2 hours after the arrival window, the technician arrived. They had communicated the final time after, but nevertheless, it was still later than that time.  The technician was rushed, very rushed. The attention to detail was not there. I paid for an entire TV mounting, yet I was expected to help. I actually had to change my plans to be there that late, and I still had to lift the heavy TV on and off of the mount a few times, and he even asked my wife to help as well. Why am I paying for an installation when I'm so actively helping? I don't mind helping, but I also would rather not be paying for myself to do some of the work. It just seemed really weird.  In addition, I told him clearly and marked exactly where and how high to mount the TV, but even then, it's still too low and not where I wanted it. He really didn't want to go the extra mile to make sure I was happy.  I didn't want to fight it or make it worse. It's just not worth my time. But now I have a nice new TV mounted in a suboptimal way. It's supposed to be really flush with the wall, but he used an extension chord that is in the way (which he also asked me to pay for). We wouldn't need an extension chord if he actually put the TV in the right spot and cut the in-wall channel in the middle rather than way over on the right.  Overall, it was a really rushed job and I had to help out a lot. Also, I was told they wouldn't haul the boxes/shipping material away, but would put it in the trash/recycling, but he also didn't do it. I just wanted him to finish because it was so rushed and unpleasant. I spent another hour breaking down the box and cleaning up afterwards, and then spent another hour trying to fix the mistakes and get the TV flush like it should be. There were so many steps he didn't do, and even mentioned that those steps were for amateurs. Unfortunately, that also means amateurs do a good job at making sure the mount is flush and setup as designed.  The technician was nice, but the rushed nature sucked.  The company did say they would have a QC technician come out to take a look and fix if they could. They would honor a 30 day guarantee. So I definitely think they want to make it right, and I think they would. But the QC technician's window of arrival was a huge 3 hour window the next day. That additional stress of it all, waiting again for 3 hours, just wasn't going to cut it for me.  They genuinely want to do the right thing, but man, I really didn't have a good time and maybe I'll ultimately take their offer to get their QC technician out here, but it was just not a good experience at all, and I really don't know if I want to deal with another round of it.  I think the way to make this right: 1. Have the technician come at an EXACT time, not a 3 hour window 2. Refund me some more portion of the cost because of how much I was expected to help 3. Actually redo the job, patch up the holes, and not require my help (maybe bring a second or third technician)  I hope this is just a one time thing, and that otherwise they are great at what they do. I will be looking elsewhere, and just wanted to leave this in case it's useful."

5,Reza was early for the appointment and was able to work around the metal around the Sheetrock.
5,"I like that Mohammad and Reza went out of their way to contact me so I didn’t have to wait another day. Even though I live in a older house, the walls are not always easy to work with. They did a great job mounting my Flat screen TV and sound system. I would recommend them.  Thank you LC"

The process is very simple – describe the scope of work – an estimate is offered – schedule the time of service – easy peasy. Farivar arrived on the scheduled day, performed the work, completed the job within the allotted timeframe and he cleaned up the area he worked in. I am very impressed with Farivar, he is extremely professional, courteous and knowledgeable. I would recommend Thumbtack and Farivar."

5,"I was very impressed by this teams professionalism, efficiency and craftsmanship. Additionally I was impressed with their close attention to COVID protocols. They entered our home with masks/shoe covers, and perfectly mounted our flat screen in less than 15 minutes.   Beyond that, throughout the quoting process they were very helpful in helping us choose our mount and giving us the best price possible.  I’m already considering using them for other TVs in our home! Would highly recommend!"
5,"I had bought two bookshelves from IKEA (same model), and failed to assemble them. So, I decided to hire a ""pro"". I could not be happier. Farivar texted me one hour before he arrives to let me know when he was arriving, and he did arrive on time. He finished assembling the shelf that I tried to assemble, and then assembled the next one from the scratch. He was very respectful, polite, and his job was really well-done. I hope to count on his service again when needed."
5,Very easy to book an appointment. Got my treadmill assembled without trouble. I will use their service again in the future.
5,"They arrived right on schedule, no delay and they were professional and worked efficiently with their time. I highly recommend their services"

5,"So glad I chose this service. Very professional, courteous, and technician Farivar went above and beyond."
5,"Mansour, arrived on time, worked efficiently and was very professional. I was extremely happy with the FixTman service and Mansour! I will definitely use the service again - and ask for Mansour!"
5,Exactly what I wanted. I decided to do what would be the cheapest option and just get the tv mounted to my drywall without concealing any wires. Our technician Reza Moghadam was very communicative and responsive to my inquiries along with the company. My living room looks beautiful with this service. Would definitely recommend!
5,"FixTman hung my tv on the wall and they did it with care, efficiency and speed. The installer was running a little late but I was notified ahead of time and it was fine. They worked quickly and recommended the perfect height for our tv. I will definitely use their services in the future and will recommend them to family and friends."
5,Reza and his team were fantastic. Loved how fast and efficient they were and the shelves look great!
5,"They called in advance to let me know what time they would arrive so I wasn't guessing within the 2 hour window. They showed up right when they said they would. The job took 30 minutes from start to finish. They were extremely professional and cleaned up after themselves when done. To top it off, they were polite and friendly. I highly recommend them."
3,"They were only able to complete half the job they were hired to do. Before hiring, I asked if they can mount a TV and a security camera. They asked for the model and link to the camera and then confirmed, yes they could.   The day of the appointment, they tell me prefer not to come at the prescheduled time bc I am too far. I was flexible so I allowed them to come the next day. Fatima was pleasant and kind. Mounted my TV fine but the man complained that fishing the wires behind the wall would be too difficult (even though I would be paying $50 just for fishing and my previous mounters fished it through the wall without saying a peep and no charge). Then I gave them my camera, he took one look and said he couldn’t do it bc of the wires. It is a standard Ring camera and I showed them the exact model before hiring them. I hired them specifically bc I wanted the camera mounted along with the tv. I could’ve gone to previous tv mounters who are cheaper had they been honest that they actually cannot mount cameras.   Overall- they can mount if your TV and other straightforward jobs. If you have curveballs or a complicated set up, will likely need to look elsewhere"
5,The booking process was smooth. The pro showed up on time and did a good job for the furniture assembling.
5,The tech was on time and very courteous. He texted several times to confirm prior to showing up. He completed the job quicker and I expected as well.
5,"Very clean and responsible crew. Showed up on time, both wore masks the entire time and even vacuumed up the mess. TV mount is strong enough for me to hang from and they were in and out quick. Will definitely use again and will definitely recommend to everyone!"
5,Happy with the assembly and tips they mentioned for adjustment
5,Clean and efficient job with our Marcella Bed assembly.
5,Great job by the guys installing my NordicTrack FS10i elliptical. Took an hour and a half at most. Great value for me. Highly recommended. I’ll be using FixTman again!
5,"Farivar was super kind and efficient. I have got the home gym machine almost two months ago but I wasn't sure how to put it togethe, we are so glad Farivar was able to work with us and as promised he was on time and patient enough to put together the most complicated home gym machine substancially under less than 3 hours. Thank you for your service 😀"
5,"I was looking for a pro to help with TV + sound bar wall mounting / wire concealment, and TV stand assembly. Dispatchers were very responsive and helpful, so I scheduled an appointment with them. Mohamed and Daniel came in today. They were very professional, thorough, attentive and caring. They did great job for me. Thank you FixTman team!"
5,They did a great job and it was quick. Came within the time frame mentioned. Cool guys. Will request for my other 2 TVs upstairs.
5,Very knowledgeable and helpful with proper placement and best viewing experience. Would recommend this service to anyone
5,Great company they sent someone out who could handle the job efficiently and in a reasonable time
2,Spent all this time coordinating a time with them. Then the day of they said they were stuck in a job and would be late (when they would come don’t know). After clarification would be 1-1.5 hours later. Then after that they changed to will be there in 8 minutes (which came and passed). Then a call 30 minutes later saying how about the next day? Pretty poor reliability of service. I know things happen but don’t overpromise. Wouldn’t recommend
5,Three people came and mounted the tv very fast. The mount is slight off centered a bit too far to the right. Otherwise everything was great.
5,"Farivar was excellent. he assembled an cross train bike for me.   prompt, courteous, professional , quick and tidy! could not ask for anything more!"
4,Sent a professional who was not used to the assembly but stuck to it and got it done
5,"Wow. They called with their ETA. Asked a few questions and immediately got to work. TVs were mounted quickly, wires covered, etc. Trash boxed up."
5,Did a great job mounting two TVs on two different type of mounts.
5,My Technician Farivar was on time and communicated with as he got closer to His appointment. He is professional and very quick in assembling my equipment. I would highly recommend Farivar.
5,He arrived exactly in the time frame discussed and completed the desk assembly (X2) within the quoted time frame. I paid exactly what I was quoted!
5,"I am very happy this service. My treadmill was assembled by Farivar. He was professional, punctual, did a thorough job and reasonable pricing. I Would recommend them!!"
5,Quick and easy. Will definitely use again in the future
5,"Mor and crew did a great job mounting my 65” TV and organizing all the cords. Final product looks great, and it only took maybe 20 minutes total. Couldn’t recommend them higher."
5,My 85” TV was mounted under 30 minutes. Quick and professional. Would highly recommend.
5,Project has not been completed. But have the the experience excellent to date.
5,They mounted my TV over a fireplace and did wire/cord concealment. They also put together a bookshelf and a utility shelf for me. They did a great job with all projects! I couldn’t be happier with my TV mounting especially. Thank you guys for your expertise and professionalism!
5,"Mounted the TV in one hour including hiding the cables in the wall. Half the price of other quotes I got, although it did not include installing an outlet behind the TV. Very professional."
4,He did a good job. I wished he'd had a bit more experience in the job he took on.
5,"FixTman crew did a fantastic job with my chaise, bed frame and closet. They were fast and professional; they also kindly rescheduled my appointments promptly when my shipment is delayed."
5,"Highly responsive, full-service, professional wall mounting. Provided a wall mount for purchase as well as a wire cover. Hung our TV and sound bar. Provided great guidance on where to hang it. On time and quick!"
5,TV mounting with hidden wires.  Extremely fast and efficient. Will definitely recommend to friends/family and use again myself!!! Thank you!
5,Great job by FixTman team. Highly recommended . I really liked the work quality and responsiveness.
1,"From the beginning, I mentioned that I wanted a professional"
5,I had my tv mounted and the technician was super quick and helpful. Looks great!!
5,Farivar was very personable and professional in his work. He did an excellent job setting up my 65 inch. Thank you FixTman team.
5,"My husband and I panicked last night realizing we needed our TV mounted on the very next day in preparation for the cable guy. FixTman responded right away and promptly responded to my questions. Work quality, professionalism,responsiveness are all 100% too bad I could not pick ALL compliments; I will add the 2 remaining as they will add to the FULL review... punctuality and value are superb! They gave me a time range but let me know they’d aim to the early part as per my request.. All in all SUPERB experience with FixTman!!! Will have them on speed dial for any future projects. Thank you!!!"
5,Technician was experienced and ready for variety of scenarios
5,Arrived within the agreed time window. Fast and efficient.
5,The guys were great! Super responsive and easy to work with. Would definitely recommend and hire again if I needed anything.
5,Farivar was very professional and agreed to come early to accommodate my schedule.
5,"The pro came during the specified window, and completed the task professionally. Happy with the result, would hire again."
5,Service was awesome!! Really fast and excellent result!!
5,They did a great job and I appreciate their guidance. They suggested that I not do the in wall wire concealment even though that is the more expensive service they offer because I live in a rental. That was good advice and I appreciate their honesty. Thank you.
5,Great work and very professional agency. They are flexible with appointment settings.  I would recommend their services and would utilize their services in the future.   Thank you 😊
5,Technician was very knowledgeable and got the work done quickly and effectively!
5,"They were super fast, both to respond to my initial inquiry, and to mount my TV. It was less than 24 hours between when I first reached out to them and my TV was mounted!"
3,Wasn’t what I expected for the cost. Usually when I get my tv mounted I don’t have to worry about the company having extra tools and the right equipment. I need to now go to Home Depot and hide the wires properly myself because in one room it wasn’t done right and looks crazy and in the other room they didn’t do it at all because the cover they have only conceals up to 3 wires. Shouldn’t advertise a service you can’t provide to satisfaction. Have different size quality covers and be prepared at the amount you are charging or lower your prices along with customer expectations. I wouldn’t hire this company again or recommend them.
5,"The team that came and mounted our outdoor TV was punctual, professional and did a great job. They had our TV mounted on a tilting mount in about 45 minutes on stucco with no issues or mess. They hid the power chord deftly and had extra supplies to get the job done when we had to make changes on the fly. Highly recommend sending photos of your job in advance so that the crew knows what to expect.   I would highly recommend them to anyone and use them again for future work."
5,"Mansour and Reza were punctual, professional, responsive, proficient, quick and made things so easy for me. Their online site was really easy to maneuver and they even made it easy to pay. I’ll be using them again for the 65” TV I’ll need mounted soon! My only small constructive comment is that it would’ve been nice if they had covers for their shoes but since I was still moving in it wasn’t a big deal at all. Would absolutely recommend."
5,"I got my adjustable desk assembled by them and the work was efficient and fast. Communication was very clear: I knew how much I was paying, what time the technician would be dropping by etc. I would highly recommend FixTman!"
5,Farivar did a great job helping me with tv mount installation.
5,Farivar did a perfect job mounting my TVs. He was on time and worked fast.
5,"5 star seemless experience.  They came on time and were very polite. We had a 85 inch tv and they did a fantastic job in wall mounting it.  We had earlier compared cost and this was the cheapest (and by a long margain). Will highly recommend their services, it's a no brainier."
5,I had FixTman assemble a Ab Booster Plus for me. He came on time and assembled the machine very quickly and had me try the machine to make sure it worked. Very professional and I recommend him.
5,"I got my adjustable desk assembled by them and the work was efficient and fast. Communication was very clear: I knew how much I was paying, what time the technician would be dropping by etc. I would highly recommend FixTman!"
5,"The guys gave me a call and told me exactly when they will come- they were accurate to the minute. They were also accommodating in changing the time slot in the same day.  When they came in, we realized that we won’t be able to use the existing mount. They were very effective in suggesting a mount that would fit the TV model I had for which they gave me a fair price. They installed it perfectly and cleanly- super happy."
5,was so easy to schedule and the work was completed quickly. thank you!
5,"Received a piece of furniture in the morning and they were able to come by on short notice. Excellent communication, courteous and did an excellent job of assembling our cabinet."
5,"Great attention to detail, and helped me choose the location and better position for the TV"
5,They did an excellent job mounting our 65 inch TV. They were very quick and on time. Did the job neatly with wires concealed . I would highly recommend them for any TV mounting services.:)
5,"I was so impressed with this service. They gave me a range from 12-3 but I contacted the company to inform them that I had to leave by 2:30. I was told no problem and these guys showed up right at 12pm. When do you ever get that these days?   The communication from the minute I made the request was exemplary.   The two technicians were very friendly, professional and fast. 30 minutes later when he called for me, I thought he had a question but they had already mounted and installed my 55 inch flat screen TV. Just a quit setup and they were completely finished.   I will definitely use FixTman again, which will be in a couple of weeks for my next project.   I highly recommend this company. 5 Stars plus!"
2,"I sent two pictures of where I wanted TV’s mounted and described that one is in ceiling and one is on brick. The tech that was assigned was very hesitant to do the work and expected me to do a lot of helping. Ultimately he left the job undone because apparently the dispatching person did not share the description nor pictures with the tech that was assigned, and the tech let me know that he had shoulder surgery and could not do my install (after lots and lots of texts and phone calls to prompt me to commit to hiring them). I was so frustrated with the situation that I decided to not continue with this contractor when they offered to send out a different tech on a different day. I’m sharing the pics I used to communicate the expected scope of worm…You tell me if it is not clear where and what and how a tv will be mounted from the pictures that I shared with them. So I was extra insulted when the tech wasn’t aware of the scope of work before he showed up at my house."
5,The technician came was very polite and professional. They did a great job mounting my tv
2,"We provided a detailed project description to this business. The initial contact went well and they sent a really clear itemized invoice right afterwards which made us feel really confident in their work.   However, the technician showed up and said he didn't know the scope of the job, he didn't bring the tv mount we paid for, and he told us he couldn't complete the job because he had another job to get to in 1.5 hours.   While he was here working, he didn't bring a shop vac or a ladder for a light fixture installing and tv mounting job. He asked to step up on our toddler high chair (we said no) and he also banged our new TV against the couch and laid is on the edge of the couch display side down."
5,Very punctual and was great to work with; good outcome and happy with the results!

5,"They're pretty cool, professionals. Many Thanks, I'm glad I chose them"
5,"Great communication and quick+accurate service. Hired the team for a 77in tv installation, complex as it was on a brick wall, they did a great job"
4,"Although there were a couple hiccups in scheduling and arrival time overall read satisfied with the work. Advised that mount purchased was not going to fit in recessed wall, but had a reasonably priced mount they ended up Installing that met our goals for side swivel."
5,"Very professional, did a great job. Assembly was done perfectly with no damage"
5,I had a really great experience using this service. You guys were very responsive and worked quickly! I will definitely be using you again in the future.
5,Will definitely hire again - Farivar was beyond excellent!
5,Very nice and professional got here on time highly recommend this guys 👍👍👍👍👍
5,The technician was very professional and did an amazing job on my tv stand. I’m extremely happy with the service
2,"They arrived on time with all the right tools but I found the person who helped me to be challenging and lacked precision.   First, the curtain rods in my living room are not hung up straight and when I said that, he suggested they were properly leveled. Second, one bracket was not properly screwed into the wall and I had to point it out for him to fix it.   Next, I had him hang up a curtain rod in my child’s room and said I wanted the curtains to hang six inches to the side of the window. He hung the curtain rod directly on top of the window and then said he couldn’t move it because there were no studs. I found it frustrating that I found this out after explicitly stating where I wanted the curtain rod.   For $180, I would’ve expected better communication and precision."
5,Perfect installation. The team was fast and efficient. They made sure things were in working order and in proper placement. Would definitely recommend their services!
5,I needed a new Nordictrac recumbent studio bike assembled. It’s a fairly complex assembly. The work was done quickly and professionally. I highly recommend FixTman for similar projects.
5,They did a great job helping me mount my tv. Initially I had a ceiling mount they were able to help me get the correct mount! Thank you! Will use again for future projects!
5,The two installers ended up coming early (they called ahead to make sure it was ok). They did stellar work and checked with me throughout. I’d highly recommend them.
5,We had an amazing experience with our TV installation. Professionally done. Great attitude and very flexible with our schedule
5,Yes I would recommend them without hesitation. Mansour was very professional and caring and did a great job and also came at a good time to do the work
2,"Fixtman charged me 179 bucks to assemble an ikea bookcase qnd crib. The bpokcase needs 2 people according to the manual. Fixtman claimed their techs are very experienced and 1 is enough.  The technician who came was about to nail the wrong side of centre shelf which cannot be repaired later. He could not fit the doors. We read the manual and told him how to do it. He placed all the shelving upside down and did not fit some parts which were required for soft close. We also had to help him with the hanging of the shelf for which they charged an extra 50$ dollars. He did not see the L clamps and their hole size before drilling. He was about to drill a large hole which would have made it impossible to fit the shelf   All in all, we had to read the manual and oversee quite a bit. I felt bad for the technician since he did not seem experienced and fixtman just sent him without an additional person. So if you want to hire fixtman, make sure you have someone at home to help them and oversee, also figure out if it's worth your money"
5,Great experience! very professional & quick. Would definitely recommend for future projects.
5,Shervin showed up and got the  job done fast and efficiently!
5,He was awesome! Knowledgeable and friendly! Thank you so much!
5,Moe answered all of my questions and I'm satisfied with the work
2,"The installers came in late and seemed in a lot of rush. I could not communicate directly with the installer because he wasn't comfortable/willing to speak English. But there was another person who helped translate - that and the rush they seemed to be in definitely threw me off.  I was misguided on how to center the tv - for an additional cost. Since the mount would end up going on the dry wall and not the stud, I declined which turned out to be great because the mount itself had a way to adjust the tv horizontally. Which I did after they left.  Finally, the TV was installed 5 inches higher than I had request. But then they ran away as soon as it was done before I could get a chance to sit and inspect and all.  I am not happy. I will just fix it by myself now I guess and will be careful hiring someone on ThubTack."
5,Very responsive. I wish the marks left on the TV were also cleaned by the folks who came. Otherwise they were very professional and courteous
5,Reza’s team was top notch! 100% satisfied with their quality of work mounting our 3 TVs
2,"Hope my experience is an exception.I hired them because hood review and business volume on this platform. 1, After the appointment be set , they sent me text messages, They charge reschedule fee and cancel fee, I am Ok with it, but they rescheduled the appointment at last minute. make me spend whole day waiting in the house. 2, The guy left without the job done , Until I called the company. 3.They proposal 85 dollars for my two bookcase assemble, after assemble, they side they the price for one item. This issue cost one hour get settled. Everything looks tricky."
5,If you need a mounted tv installed Reza team are very professional and complete the install in a matter of no time..
5,I appreciated FixTman's professionalism and quality of work. They assembled several furniture pieces for me and I was impressed with their care and excellent service. Would definitely hire again.
5,"Arrived on time, extremely polite and fast! Would definitely hire again!"
5,Showed up on time. Fast and efficient work. Would hire again!
5,"Showed up on time, prepared, did the job quickly and efficiently. Would use again."
5,Super fast. Very professional. They unpacked the TV and the mount and set everything up. Perfect service.
5,"They were able to fulfill my request the very next day, technician was on time and quick, my TV looks great!"
5,He was professional and so talented. He was easy to work with and helpful.
5,Great and fast Service. Very friendly and knowledgeable team.
5,Mansour from FixTman helped us with assembling the treadmill. He arrived at the location on time and completed the assembly within the estimated time. He assembled and moved it to the spot where we wanted and made sure the treadmill functions before leaving.
5,"I had a great experience, my technician assembled a bed very quickly and it's very solid! Would definitely book again!"
5,"Very good experience mounting 2 TVs. One 85 inch, one 49 inch. Very fast and professional. Great installation."
5,Got my tv mount up in about 30 minutes. Very quick but professional and diligent. Would hire them again in a heartbeat
5,"Great work and great company!! Very responsive on the app and answered all my questions before hand. Mansour was AMAZING!! He put together furniture for my entire apartment! This included a canopy bed, coffee table, Vanity desk, and the mighty 12 drawer dresser from IKEA!! He worked quickly and efficiently. He ensured all furniture was perfectly leveled, brought his own tools, cleaned up all the card board boxes and even helped me arrange my furniture. I couldn’t have asked for anything more! I will definitely hire again.   I was even a little bit scared to have a man in my apartment since I live alone, but Mansour was very kind, professional, and a total gentleman!   Thank you to this company!! 🙏🏽"
5,Wall mount was installed quick and looks great in our office. 100% would recommend their service
5,Reza and his partner did a wonderful job. The project I had envisioned turned out great. Linda
5,Took down both my large TVs in under 30 minutes. Nice and professional! Good communication too.
5,"Great customer service. They were timely, speedy and very pleasant to work with."
5,Mounted a delicate TV and pictures quickly and efficiently!
5,"They were great, very professional, knew what they were doing. Except for not maintaining the correct time window."
5,They were awesome! Very kind and put up my tv’s extremely fast. I would highly recommend them!
3,"Update: Almost immediately after posting my 1 star review, I got a message from the company. They apologized and said they were confused because I already had an appointment scheduled to fix the issue at no cost. I never got a message asking when I was available or confirming any appointments.   When I asked when my appointment was for, they said Thursday from 3-5. Thursday around 1pm, I got a text asking if they could come on Friday instead. I said I was available before 8:30 or after 10:30. They said okay confirmed. ?? I asked what time my appointment was, and they had scheduled me from 8:30-10:30. Exactly when I was not available. I explained my schedule again, and they said they would come at 8.   They actually arrived at 8:05 and fixed everything and it looks great now. The end result is great, but all the hard work of scheduling and rescheduling this service so many times was not worth it. I will not use this company again.   Original 1 star review: While it seems like they typically have great service, I did not have a great experience.  I originally scheduled an appointment for 4pm on a Wednesday. They arrived at 2:45, and unfortunately my baby was in the middle of his nap. I asked if they could come back at my scheduled time, maybe see another client first, because I didn't want the sound to wake the baby. They said no and asked if they could come the next morning at 8am, and I agreed.  At 8:35 the next morning they had not arrived yet. I texted them asking if they would be there by 9, because the baby would be napping again at 9:15. They said there was a lot of traffic, and they could not make it by 9, and we rescheduled for the next day at 3:30. They said ""We will be there at 3:30 on the dot.""  The next day they arrived... at 4:45. They put the tv up, and seemed to be in a bit of a rush. While they were putting it up I wasn't sure if it was quite right, but I saw them measuring and assumed they are the experts and know what they are doing. I should have double checked right at that moment. When the tv was up it looked fine, and they left quickly. After looking at the TV a bit longer, I realized it was not centered on the fireplace. Within an hour I messaged them saying that it was not centered and asking if it could be fixed. I specifically said ""there is 19.5 inches of space on one side and 16.5 inches of space on the other side"". They scheduled an appointment for a few days later at 4 pm.  At 3:45 they called me and said ""do you still want us to come today, or should we come tomorrow?"" I said please come, I am ready. So they come at 4:30. One of the guys was there a few days earlier, but he did not speak English. The other guy was new, and he spoke English and acted as translator. The guy who was the same immediately started measuring things. The new guy looks at me and says ""Did someone else do this? You can see just by looking at it that it's not centered."" And I said ""no actually, you did. he was here the other day with someone else."" And he said ""wow, I'm sorry. We will make this right.""   The two men chat a bit, and then he tells me ""we basically have to redo the whole thing. They didn't give us much time today. They just said you needed it straightened, so is it OK if we come back another time?"" He again tells me ""we will make this right"". I agree to yet another visit, and he tells me that the scheduling service will need to call me to set up time.  A few hours later someone calls me and says ""so it sounds like we have to redo it, so I just wanted to see if you still wanted to proceed."" I ask him to confirm that I will not be charged, since it was their mistake. We go back and forth a bit, he seems to have some incorrect details (for example, stating thatI asked for service on two tvs, which I did not), and then he says ""it seems like maybe we have some inaccurate information, and maybe your records got mixed up. Is it OK if I give you a call back?"" I say yes, and he never calls back. So now I paid them almost $200 for a crooked TV, and will now have to pay someone else to fix it."
5,"They came, mounted the tv and sound bar I requested and it looks great. Just where I wanted it."
5,FixTman did a very good job -- were fast and efficient and tidy!
5,The team did an excellent job! They were on time and professional!
5,"Very capable, fast, nice, and efficient. Amazing service."
1,"The Technician showed up late, he then spent 90 minutes trying to figure out the situation, which he couldn’t!   This Soundbar is still here collecting dust !😡"
1,"I booked this company last Sunday to assemble my IKEA PAX wardrobe. I requested two technicians to complete the task due to the large size of the wardrobe and how heavy the pieces are.  They cancelled my appointment on Sunday hours before they were supposed to come because they couldn’t find a 2nd technician. So I rebooked for the next night (Monday), and confirmed with them multiple times that two technicians would arrive.   Sadly, only one person showed up and looked at my wardrobe and said he couldn’t do it.  Biggest waste of two days/nights for me and still nothing has been assembled. They were the quickest to respond to my request on Thumbtack, and after reviewing their services I thought it was a good pick based on reviews. But I was completely wrong and they took the opportunity away from others on Thumbtack that could have completed the task."
1,"Flake. Initially great responsiveness to book and using their app. I was very impressed with the speed and quality of the communications. But unfortunately, the positive experience ended with the booking communications. The person scheduled flaked for the morning appointment and then did not show up again for the rescheduled appointment at the scheduled time.   I contacted them 1 hour after appointment time and they then tried to schedule it out AGAIN by another 3 hours later. In addition the had the audacity to schedule the same person that flaked for the first appointment for the rescheduled one. Really? I WILL NOT USE THIS COMPANY."
5,Super fast at their work but did arrive late and rescheduled time slot day of
5,"Great service, mounted my 65” inch TV exactly how I wanted it"
1,"Even after sharing clear description along with pictures before hand, the vendor demanded more money on site stating that the work was under scoped earlier. Avoid."
1,"Ask him to put together a trampoline. He didn’t even read the instructions. They called me and said they need a second person. When I examined what he was doing, he didn’t even read the instructions. By the time we got the trampoline set up the net was on backwards and he said he has come back tomorrow to take it apart to put it back together. Glad I did not pay prior to the work being done. This company should not be in business"
5,Farivar was extremely thorough and is clearly a perfectionist. I highly recommend
5,Team did a great job putting up our tv in less than 20 minutes! Thanks!!
1,Your service is horrible my appointment was at 10 o’clock they did not arrive till 10:30 the job is to hang artwork on my high ceiling walls I specified they needed a long ladder when I spoke with a young lady over the phone and when gentleman finally arrived he had no ladder.
4,"Mansour from FixTman installed the treadmill for us. He was late, but informed us ahead of time so that we could adjust our planning. The installation work was done professionally. He set the treadmill properly at the location we set it to. He addressed all my questions about the installation and told me to call him if there is any issue we face while using the treadmill. He cleared up the area and put everything in the box for easy disposal."
5,They were very fast and really professional. The TV’s came out perfect.
1,"The technician who had come over to wall- mount my TV over the fireplace had no prior information of what needed to be done and insisted that mounting a TV above a fireplace with concealed wires was impossible!. I had spent time with someone from FixTpro explaining all the details of what needed to be done and shared pictures of the wall concealer kit I had purchased, but turns out none of this info was passed on the person who came over. STICK TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS!"
1,"They mounted a 65” TV on my living room wall. The first time I pulled the tv out so I can see it better from the kitchen (the mount has an adjustable arm and is designed for this type of movement) the tv and mount fell off the wall. They both came right off the wall. The company took 0% of the responsibility. The TV fell onto a marble table and the tv screen cracked, the mount bent, and it the iPhone sitting on the table was damaged.  They sent two men from the company to assess the damage and take pictures. A manager then called and incessantly stated it was not the company’s fault “due to the evidence” ie the pictures THEIR company took and THEIR department reviewed. At nauseam, he repeated it was not their fault and continued to reference THEIR assessment of the situation and implied that the accident was a result of an “outer force” applied to it. When we asked what this could be his reply insinuated we had done it by maybe applying to much pressure, someone hanging from it etc. We did neither but had no way of proving it. How do we as customers prove to a company with legal council we did no such thing? This is unfair and one-sided. Company v. me and my wife. Their conclusion that it was not their fault and therefore we would not be compensated is clearly one-sided and unfair. We are out of about $2500. We would have never imagined that using Thumbtack to refer us to this company would result in a loss of $2500 (cost of tv $2000, cost of wall mount $165 cost of installation $185), time and inconvenience.   It is 100% their fault and they are taking 0% of the responsibility. I will never use this company. I will repost this review on Yelp."
5,"The technicians were prompt, experienced and did an excellent job. I recommend them highly."
5,They were quick and everything they hung for us looks great!
2,"It’s hard to review these people, and I feel sorry that this happened to myself, but it can happen again and again. The main issue is that they send two pros, one is the main pro, who may or may not speak in English, and the other who is actually not a pro, but a translator for English. This makes it really hard to communicate to the actual person doing the job. In our case, the translator was very sensitive to our demands, took everything personally.    Now as for the real review on the work, we had to mount a soundbar and also a curtain rod. We told them to NOT level the soundbar with the TV as it was not leveled itself and we could adjust the tv later but they didn’t hear or didn’t understand, and we’ve had to then get in to some argument around it, was a terrible experience. After that, the soundbar was not centered, and they again went in to an argument with me about it and I had to bring my own tape measure to show them, it was off by a whole darn inch. They then fixed it by redoing the screws again, so now there are 2x holes behind my soundbar, does not show, but the shabbiest job ever for a simple mount.   Ok now for the curtains, they did a good job listening to instructions this time, but they left the curtain rod completely lose!!!!! Me and my wife had to tighten all the brackets with the provided Allen key. When I had confronted them that it was lose, they said they could manage only that.   Terrible service, I would never go for these people."
5,Great service. Timely and really cared about the quality!
5,On point insulation was a breeze for these professionals I will recommend them to anyone who is seeking These services
1,"Price transparency and price for service actually provided -- I was quoted for a very different service to install my TV and consultation on which TV mount to use (with TV mounts provided) than the service that was actually provided. FixTman said that the initial quote that was provided was my final fee despite the many issues encountered, services not provided, and the parts of the project not completed (for example, bringing a TV mount that would fit my TV along lines we had discussed, which I would pay for). Unfortunately, it was not an easy customer experience when I contacted FixTman and the situation was not resolved after calling and messaging the Company.  I was also contacted by at least three different people via phone, email, and text at FixTman LLC over a 24 hour period confirming different technicians at different times and days. Ultimately, a technician arrived a day ahead of what was scheduled and I only knew about it shortly ahead of time.   Would suggest a different service, at least for TV mounting purposes."

1,"I wanted a treadmill assembled. I carefully provided the brand and model number when I made the appointment. The couple arrived, took one look at it and said it was too heavy and they couldn’t do it for the price I had paid. They said they would have to call the “company” and would come back another day (perhaps next week). I said I needed it assembled today. I sent them away and assembled it myself in a couple hours."

1,"I had a man named Derek!  He first told me he could do my simple taking apart a couch so it could fit through a door and then putting it back together project.  He then calls me and tells me that I’m order for the project to happen I need to pay him for moving it upstairs even though he didn’t have to move the furniture anywhere. I tell him I’m not doing that then he calls me to let me know he can’t do the project and to cancel my appointment! Also he kept calling more than 10 times until I finally had to block him!  Update: Charlie is a man on this app who decided to contact me and tell me that he thought my project was fake so he decided to screw me over and cancel my appointment!  I had proof of a picture I sent to them, I told them ahead of time that I did not have instructions, because I bought it off of another person!  If my project was fake why did I give a real number, real email address, real pictures, real address. All I wanted was for someone to take apart my couch so I can move it to another location!   Charlie proceeds to harass me about taking this review down! He said that everything I’m stating is a lie!   I mean seriously how rude all because I didn’t pay you an extra $85 to take it literally 5 seconds away!  I will never come back on here again!"

1,This company is just plain disgusting. I requested cancellation of my project one day before but they said that I had to pay 20 dollars still as I requested cancellation less than 24 hours before. They also said that I had signed Thumbtack contract (I do not know though of anything) for paying them. I did not sign any contract with this company at all. They just snatched the money without doing anything. No one should talk to them even. There are enough much better companies and people who are much more flexible.
5,Responded quickly professional job
5,Reza M. was fast and efficient! Great value.

2,"I bought a new MantleMount (one of those tv mounts that drops down over a fire place) and needed it installed. I filled in my information request (exactly what I needed, how heavy my tv was, pictures, etc), and then was told the day before that I would need to “help” the one guy coming unless I wanted to pay more. I’m nine months pregnant and obviously wasn’t up for helping hold a 70” tv. I found this to be deceiving that they quoted me low but then had these additional charges for extra guys, and an additional charge for dismounting my current tv when I clearly stated in my initial job request that my tv would need to be dismounted. I would have appreciated transparency with the initial quote - they quoted me $180 and it ended up being closer to $300.  The worst part was, the guys that came out seemed to have never installed a mount like this before. They placed the mount way too low at first and it wouldn’t even come back up over the mantle. They came back after I had to measure and prove to them that they could place it higher without hitting the ceiling, and then they placed it way too high and didn’t even make the sound bar flush with the tv. Eventually, my husband and father-in-law redid it and now it looks good, but it took a lot of work since the guys that came out stripped a lot of the screws the mount came with.   I’m giving them 2 stars for coming out to try and fix it, but ultimately we had to fix it a third time ourselves to get it right. Wish I could get my $300 back. Also, just a small note, but the cologne one man was wearing was way too strong and left a scent in the room for the day. As a nurse, I don’t wear perfume at work because I know people might be sensitive to it. I believe these guys should adopt a similar approach to customer service.   The photos are of the mount way too high and the sound bar not flush, and my husband measuring it when it was too low and realizing it could go up and not hover over the mantle (we took the sound bar off so it wouldn’t hover over the mantle - even though the “pros” said you couldn’t take it off).   In the future, I hope these guys just say up front if they don’t know how to do a job, versus do it incorrectly and try to convince me it’s right and there’s nothing else they can do and leave. They kept saying it would hit the ceiling if it was higher, or that the sound bar can’t come off. Both of which we discovered were untrue.   Would not recommend."

1,"These guys are terrible. They changed the price three times. They change arrival time 4 times. They said their technician will msg or call me 30 mins before.. but he just came and I had to run from my office to home to accommodate these guys. After all this ordeal, they open everything and say they cannot do it and need more people and left. Don't hire these guys."

Another hour later, the new team showed up and did a great job but the headquarters is asleep at their job."

1,"Hired them to hang a mirror. They arrived and didn't even measure the alcove to ensure it was centered. I asked them twice to measure, they assured me they had it under control, and sure enough it was off center. They re did it, still isn't perfect but it's hung now. The initial holes they made stuck out so they said they'd come back to fix. I requested twice, both over the phone and text that they bring off white caulking. The first two times, no one showed during the appointment window. When someone did show, they brought bright white caulking. I asked him to reschedule when he had the color I requested and was promised. Haven't heard anything since. Very disappointed and would not recommend."
5,They did a very good job.
5,On time. Right price. Great job. Done right.

5,"Great service provided. Mehrdad assembled my difficult TV stand that was hard to put together. Many screws, bolts and pieces that I didn’t have passion to assemble. Mehrdad did great work! Thank you"
5,They helped us set up a wall TV mount and some curtains in our house. Very courteous and polite and made sure they were doing a quality work. Would recommend.
5,"Mehrdad did a wonderful job mounting 2 TVs and concealing the cords. Very professional, polite and good communication in making sure it was just how I wanted it.  Definitely recommend!"

5,"Wouldn’t recommend service.   Left large amount of wire exposed, about 2 feet horizontally. Cut holes in the wall even though he knew he couldn’t hide the wires and this would be the result.   I don’t know why he wouldn’t tell me he couldn’t properly hide the wires because of the studs BEFORE he drilled two big holes in my drywall.  Recommending an electrician after the holes were already drilled is unhelpful. Disappointed.  Edited Review:  After leaving the above review I was contacted by customer service and a HUGE effort was made to make the service right. We discussed expectations versus what they are permitted to do and we came to an agreement. Even offered to come out again!  These folks aren’t electricians so they are limited in their ability to do complicated jobs. I would hire them to do work for me again if I don’t care if wires are exposed in a second. Will make sure my expectations are known in advance of job.  Tech was fast and nice, he even went out of his way to buy a less visible cord for us."
5,The Tech Mehrdad is a pro. I hired him to install my 6 drawer chest and he did it with utmost perfection. He arrived on time and immediately started doing the job. He was extremely professional. Would love to work with AmzTech again in the future.
5,I contacted Amztech llc to install a wooden curio cabinet with glass doors and mirrors. They were very professional right from the initial estimate call all the way to install. Suzie even followed up right before the install to know when i could expect the tech within the window that she gave me before. Hosseinali came on time and did an amazing job with the install. I will definitely be using their services again
5,Very responsive and the best value I ever got at Thumbtack. We’ll definitely hire them again for our next project and furniture assembly.  Thank you guys!
5,"I found the installers to be punctual, courteous, neat, they made sure they cleaned up after themselves and very patient and flexible when I was deciding where I wanted to hang a piece of art."

5,Great work by Mehdrad. The whole mounting was done in 45 mins. The job was executed cleanly. As a bonus he also helped unpack another heavy TV and place it on a cabinet with no extra charge. Highly recommend!
5,"AmxTech didi a wonderful job for our 75” TV mounting project. The price was very reasonable. The technicians were on time, very professional and helpful! I would hire them for my next job!!"
5,"I admit that I first choose amztech bc its reasonable price. But their professionalism and work quality surprises me. The whole project went on smoothly and it takes half an hours or so. They even patched the holes that I drilled for my previous tv mount.  Overall, very good service."

5,"Had AmzTech assemble my dining table set. The service was top notch and very cordial. Even though some parts were missing, they offered to come back again and finish the assembly for free once I get all the missing parts. Going to rely on AmzTech for furniture assembly in future."
5,The job was done carefully and very clean.  He was able to work in a small already tight space apartment.   I feel that my daughter will be safe on her bunk bed tonight and that is all that matters in the end. Thank you.
5,AmzTech was amazing. I have 5 items to put together. Amz tech did a great job tackling a big project. I'll call them again when I need help!
5,I’m very satisfied with the job done by Amz technician. I had my plans changed and the lady on the phone kindly rescheduled the job to the day I asked. The job itself was done very fast and professional.
5,"Great! I had a tv mount on the wall and just needed help getting a tv up on it. They came fast, same day, and did the job for a reasonable price since it didn’t take long. Would hire again!"

5,Mehrdad did a nice job of installing our entertainment centre. It’s a complicated assembly. He patiently listened to my requirements and clarified some of doubts I have about the stability of the install. The final result was very much inline with my expectation.
5,Mehrdad completed job well under difficult circumstances. Pieces of furniture had been damaged and he improvised a solution. I give him a five.

5,Very nice to work with and great job done! Much appreciated. Will be using for future jobs.
4,The technician was great! Saved me a lot time and frustration. Would definitely hire him again.
2,They are a bunch of interns. The technician never showed up the first day. Then the technician shows up the next day super late. Does not have the tools needed. I had to go and purchase the tool for him. In spite of that did a very shoddy job.   The task was to remove the sliding glass door to the bathtub and install curtain rods. The job was done badly. With tons of scratches on my bathtub and no plan to fix them. Would not hire them again.

1,"Hemi reached out to me and said he’ll price match my job and will come at an even earlier time than the competitor who I confirmed with. So I cancelled with my original guy and moved forward with AmzTech, then they called me 15 min before our appointment saying they can’t make it and will have to reschedule for tomorrow. Ummmmmmm….. no thanks. Not reliable. Makes it extra frustrating when I asked to leave work early to make the appointment, only for them not to be able to make it on time."

I never heard anything from any technician."

3,"+ 1 star for professional and prompt communication in the app + 1 star for showing up on time + 1 star for the portion of the work completed - Minus 2 stars for working extremely slow. Details below.  Why I rated 3 stars: I only give 4 stars when I have zero complaints, and I only give 5 stars when someone goes above and beyond in a truly spectacular way. That’s why this was a 3. Other people rank simply passable average work as 5 stars, but that’s not the way I rate.  Job: Pulling weeds by hand Rate: $49/hr. At the end he tried to say the rate was $60/hr but I had our DMs where he’d previously quoted $49/hr.  Details: I asked Kevin to weed our small front yard and pull a few other weeds along an adjacent sidewalk; I was clear upfront that I only wanted to pay for two hours max. After 90 minutes (!), he’d only weeded a corner that was about 4’x4’ and I asked him to pay attention to other areas with big, obvious, easily-pullable weeds that were still sitting there. He seems to pay a lot of attention to minuscule details while ignoring bigger more obvious things like 3’ tall dandelions and entire swaths of tall weeds. I wouldn’t describe him as efficient, e.g. using a weak leaf blower to blow 2 inches of dirt at a time when sweeping would be sooo much faster. I asked him to stop after two hours since that was my agreement upfront. He said he’d add a few extra minutes for free and that he usually throws that in for clients. He has a pleasant if slightly awkward communication style/demeanor. But wow, the slowness — even with a migraine I could have gotten more accomplished in half the time.   The kicker is that the assigned work isn't complete — I either have to hire someone else to finish pulling the weeds or just do it myself. For contrast, I previously had someone on Craigslist to weed the entire front yard plus the parking strip in ONE hour for $50 (I wish I’d saved his number). Hiring hourly on Thumbtack is frustrating — It would be better if we could price a job at a flat rate no matter how long it takes because hourly pricing seems to encourage people to work as slowly as possible. Kevin is a nice guy but not a match for my expectations. Good luck!"

He came at closer to 10. I had one coatrack that I needed to mount and two leaky sinks. He fixed the coatrack right away, and it is now secure. For both sinks, he said that the leak couldn’t be fixed and I needed to replace the faucets on both of them. He offered to help me order new faucets, but I declined. His work inspecting the faucets and mounting the coatrack took less than an hour, so he asked me if I had anything else he could help with."

1,"Arranged for him to work 4-7pm (his preference). No show. We considered a calendar mix up but he failed to respond to attempts to confirm, check, and verify. When we finally reached him by phone, he stated he had not placed us on his schedule after all. Summary: Lack of communication, professionalism in common problem solving, and clarity in communication. This man does not know me, spouse, kids, et al. That number of individuals is even referenced is unacceptable."
5,"Kevin did a great job installing outside shades, mirror, bathroom hardware and fixing a light! I will definitely hire him again."
5,"Once he was finished, Kevin had done a great job hanging heavy mirrors and curtains. Everything was level and he used quality mounting materials. He was fast and affordable. I would work with him again in the future."
5,Kevin did a terrific job of painting the living room and patching up the walls. We were also working on replacing the bathroom sink faucet but some major plumbing issues require us to hire a plumber. I would definitely hire Kevin again.
5,Kevin assembled 2 West Elm chairs for me. He was very professional and friendly and he put the chairs together quickly. I will definitely work with him in the future.
5,"Kevin installed a pet door for me, and it looks great! Scheduling was a little challenging but once we had a time confirmed everything went smoothly."
5,Very knowledgeable and kind. A pleasure to work with. Did a great job! For a great price!
5,"Once he was finished, Kevin had done a great job hanging heavy mirrors and curtains. Everything was level and he used quality mounting materials. He was fast and affordable. I would work with him again in the future."
5,This was a great experience for me. I been trying to get my bed put together for two years but lost some screws when I moved here. Kevin was able to achieve what no one could and he did it very professionally and fast.
5,"Kevin was very professional, and knowledgeable about plants. He was very polite and made helpful suggestions."
5,High quality work. Very responsive and always arrived on time.
1,"Kevin is a kind guy, but the work he did planting our trees was not well done. We asked for 7 trees to be planted - and specified that we needed with holes dug 2x wide, filled with new soil, and gopher wire. He did not do this. Instead: - the holes for all 7 trees were dug 2-4 inches wider than the root ball.  - only 1 tree was given new soil (we purchased extra bags of soil for this and pointed them out to Kevin, but he did not use them) - only 2 trees were planted with gopher wire.   We are currently replanting all 7 trees. The avocado started to die because it was surrounded by clay instead of enough new soil, and there were a lot of air pockets. Kevin said it was normal for the tree to lose all leaves and come back next year...but that didn’t seem right. Poor tree. We’ve replanted it with a hole twice as wide as the root ball, new soil, and leaves have stopped dropping. New buds are forming. Super thankful.   This has been very frustrating.We paid $400 dollars across 2 visits, and have to re-do the work - the right way. We will not work with Kevin again or recommend his services."
5,"Even though the job was small, Kevin responded quickly and was super easy to work with"
1,"I tried to reach out to him regarding a small project we needed assistant with. I heard back a day later, so I thought ""Great! He can help us!""  I don't know if it wasn't a big enough job or he's just too busy, but I would respond to his message and not hear anything several times. So I called him to ask if he was still interested, he said he would call me back and let me know when he could come to our house. Once again, he did not respond. I'm frustrated because I would just rather someone tell me they aren't interested than give me the run around."
5,Very timely replies. Professional
5,Job well done at very reasonable price
1,Awful communication skills and very unprofessional. He canceled 3 times within a hour of project. This app needs accountability for individuals that operate like this. @thumbtack you have the capability to track message between the individuals with that information it would cut down on individuals like Kevin not showing up or being inconsiderate of someone else’s time.

5,It all starts with the right knowledgeable contractor. We were fortunate enough to have Angelo. We will certainly use him again for other jobs if needed.
5,Angelo came to fix and reinstall a few light fixtures and repair some entryways as well as a few different things around the house I’ve been putting off getting repaired for months!! He was fast and did an amazing job on everything and now I’m in sheer bliss with these upgrades and appreciate just being home and inviting company. This recommendation is the least I could offer for such a job well done by a professional with a great personality! Definitely using this service again.
5,I had some curtain rods hung in a few rooms around the house. Very fast and professional work. He also help install my ring security camera and sensors. Thanks for your great work.

5,"Carlos and team were punctual, easy to communicate with and highly skilled at installation and cabinetry. They installed our wall cabinets and storage system onto stucco without a hitch and aligned some doors in our home as well. Highly recommended!"
5,They responded very quickly and was able to get someone out right away. It was a big job and it was done efficiently in only one day.
5,"I’m extremely satisfied with the work that Max did for me for many reasons. First, he is responsive and accommodating. Many other people I contacted were flaky and ghosted me, but not Max. He responded quickly to my requests and questions. Mostly, I’m happy with his creative solution. I hated my bedroom closet and wanted to tear it out and start all over. Max’s quote came in at 1/4 of the price of other vendors because he had a creative solution that was perfect! I couldn’t be happier with the results and would have no hesitation in recommending Max to anyone who needs work done but is looking for a cost-efficient solution."
5,"Best contractor/handymen I've hired for my beachside apartment. Max and Juan floored the pantry, upgraded my bathroom and fixed my closet doors. Really smart and easy to work with. I highly recommend Max and team and plan to call them in the future."

5,Carlos was great! Great with quality and within budget!
3,"while the quality of the work was excellent, it took longer than anyone expected, and therefore also cost more. i was ok with it costing more, the task required it, but i was uncomfortable with the idea that i had no idea how much it would cost in the end, until it was done."
5,"This was our first experience working with Max and we are very pleased!! He did a great job, was very professional and did exactly what he promised in repairing and rebuilding our 2 gates. He’s also trustworthy and we felt comfortable having him around while we were coming and going to and from appointments throughout the day. I basically explained what we wanted and he made it happen. We had wood from our gate that he also salvaged and repurposed during the rebuild of the gate which helped save on costs, especially since lumber costs have gone way up! He’s very competent in his work and our gates look great and function properly as well. I would hire Max again for other stuff as well because he did such a great job and was very reliable. That hasn’t been my experience with other people I have hired in the past, I had to chase them down. Max shows up and gets the job done! Hire him, you won’t be disappointed!"

GMI installations
5,Georgi arrived about an hour later than we had discussed but he did inform me that he was running late. He did an excellent job installing our new fireplace mantel onto our tiled fireplace wall. He also did a great job at installing both of our garden hose mounts. He was here for about 2 hours and 30 minutes. He did charge $250 for all three jobs which is on the expensive side but he was coming from the LA area. He did inform me that he would need to charge extra for the distance. We're in Santa Paula. Next time I will try to hire a more local
5,Georgi did an excellent job. Needed a cabinet trimmed for space for a refrigerator and he did the job exactly to my expectations. Would highly recommend him and would use his services again.
5,Georgi was amazing at communication and the quality and promptness of his work. If I have more jobs in this region I will certainly use Georgi. Thank you!
5,"We had a really large piece of furniture we couldn’t get around the turn in our stairs to get it to the second floor, and Georgi helped us take it apart, get it upstairs, and reassemble it. It turned out amazingly well. I was deeply impressed by what a great job Georgi did."
3,"Responsive but flakey… first scheduled for nov 6th for around 10am, then pushed it back to 1pm, one day before the job sends a message that he needs to reschedule for the next day. Also wanted to charge a 3 hour minimum because we are outside of Los Angeles, but our city is in Los Angeles? Not really reliable."

5,Work was done well and he was very professional
1,"Contractors rate is 49 per hour, however to come to my home he wanted 150.00 then an additional 49.00 per hour after two hours. His rate of pay is misleading. It should say 75.00 per hour😳"

He was honest about what could and could not be done and tried to undercharge me for the time he spent :) Also, as a woman, one can be nervous about having a stranger come in to her home alone.

5,"Vaughn was awesome, he assembled a bed frame, two night stands, a desk and a chair for me. It would’ve taken me all day to do this, it only took him just over 2 hours! He was friendly and his pricing was very reasonable."

My significant other had surgery before we moved and has had complications from healing that have made it difficult for him to lift heavy or put a lot of strain on his upper body. We hired Vaughn to put together our bed frame, dresser and boxspring since we couldn’t have done it all ourselves. He did fast, quality work at a very reasonable value and provided all of his own tools. Would highly recommend to anyone in need of housework/repairs."

Then he went silent, even as I suggested he come at 6pm the next day, since I would not be available early in the day. Too bad. I tried to give him some business, but wasn't about to be held on a string, forever rearranging my schedule, as a reviewer had indicated."

1,Don’t schedule an appointment if he is busy working with other clients. He wasted my whole day on thanksgiving eve and after 10pm said he was still busy. That’s very unprofessional and rude.
1,Unprofessional. I spoke with Vaughn on Thursday Nov 18th. He said he was free on Sunday Nov 21st to do the closet job. I mentioned 2pm/3pm he replied “Works for me” Today is Sunday Nov 21st And Vaughn is missing missing in action. He never responded to my message or called me. Meanwhile the tenant is waiting at home for her closet to be fixed because I told her Sunday Nov 21st 2-3pm. I had to hire someone else last minute. Luckily I was able to find a good handing man to do the job. This is very unprofessional business from Vaughn Jackson.

1,"They cancelled on us multiple times and then checked in and told us our technician had said they were there and left. They only spoke to us through text message and constantly tried to reschedule. We were at the house at the designated time and no one showed up. When calling the company no one answered. They said they would send someone back, but at that point the damage had been done and we could not trust them. I told them not to send anyone and they offered 5% off, which seemed almost insulting."
1,"If I could give zero stars I would. This company scheduled and rescheduled my job 3 different times, quoted different amounts several times and at the end no installer was available to complete the work. The time frames the quote are misleading and not transparent.   Moral of the story, go with any other company, you’ll be better off."
5,Im very pleased with the service and will definitely be returning in future.
5,Thanks for the excellent service. They responded immediately and gave me service in one day !
1,This was terrible! Not reliable at all. After waiting from 11am to 1pm they called me asking me if the assembler showed up. I told them no and they asking me to wait from 4pm to 6pm. They don’t respect your time. They should really change there way of operating and give you a specific time.   They really expected me to wait from 11a to 1pm then 4pm to 6pm. That’s pretty crazy!! Wouldn’t recommend it.
5,"Was on time, did the work quickly, and put up with my rambling and music"
1,Cancelled the first appointment and then Never showed up for the reschedule. Not sure why.

1,"I would put 0 star if possible. I asked them the service for July 2nd at 8am, ahead of time. Anibal texted me multiple times to confirm for July 2nd, which reinsured me at the beginning. He sent me another verification msg a day before actual moving day. Then on D-day, he doesn’t show up.  I text him, call him multiple times to finally get him over the phone. He tells me first that he thought it was for tomorrow, then he says that he forgot. He changes his argument each time. Finally he excuses himself but he is out of town and cannot make it. I’m left with all my packages ready to go and had to hire other movers in last minute with more expensive price. Absolutely horrifying experience. DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL"

5,"I needed to have a bathroom sink unclogged, couple of TVs mounted on existing fixtures on the wall, and a bathroom sprayer installed. This was the first time I was using an app to find service technicians. In the past I’d use Angies list. Ana from A++ Handymen Services contacted me promptly and scheduled the work for the very next day. Even though I was told it’d take 2 men for two hours, only one person, Alexey, showed up but he was able to get everything done by himself. Alexey was very friendly and courteous, asked if he should take his shoes off before going inside the house, and communicated with me throughout using Google translate ( I wish I had learned Russian so this part would have been easier:-)). He had to make two trips to the store to get some extra parts for the plumbing work, which was totally understandable once he explained why.  I did notice a small leak after the sprayer install, but almost immediately after I contacted them about it, Ana got back to me and scheduled for Alexey to come out to fix it right away, which he did! He just needed to tighten a bolt a bit more and that fixed it. Again, he explained everything in detail. He was keen on making sure it wasn’t leaking and waited long enough, testing it a few times before leaving. He even followed up with me later in the day to make sure the issue had been resolved!

5,"They were excellent to work with. Responded within an hour of my initial request, provided a quote, came out in 2 days, showed up on time, and did a great job. I’d use them again for sure"
5,"Was very impressed with Angel's Handy Services and their knowledge base of the various jobs we needed completed. They installed an exterior door for us and fixed an outdoor light with stubborn, old wiring. Communication was good - very quick responses. Would definitely hire again!"
5,I contacted them Sunday and they were out Wednesday for our Christmas lights. We had a few trouble spots on our roof lines. They fixed those and added lights to the rest for a clean professional look. We have found our light installer for years to come.

5,The work is perfect. The guys are very professional and polite. And they have the perfect skills to install Christmas lights and expertise in many services for home’s maintenance and repairs. 100% recommended. Congratulations to the Angel’s Handy Team.
5,Yury and his crew did a great flooring job and completed the work on a short notice. Very professional and reliable. They are trustworthy and completed the work unsupervised. Very responsive to text messages and kept me updated all the time with photos. I’d hire them again for sure and highly recommend them.
5,I needed a bathroom vanity replaced and some repairs made in a guest bath and was having a hard time finding someone to do the work. I found Angel’s on this app and decided to give them a try. They far exceeded my expectations. The contractor completed the work in 1 day and the new vanity abs fixtures look beautiful. He also installed my chandelier which looks amazing. I plan on using Angel’s for future work and highly recommend them.
1,"Where do I start? I had a HORRIBLE experience with this company! The level of professionalism and customer service skills lacks tremendously. I was threatened by Anna the dispatcher that they’d call the police and take me to small claims court because their bank didn’t get my payment. Mind you, she had the confirmation of payment sitting right in front of her! This was an issue between her worker and his bank but she reached out to me the customer threatening me and telling me about previous issues from previous jobs! When I hired them, she allowed her worker to go to the store and get parts that were the incorrect size for the job. Causing him to have to come and go and not able to complete the task in one sitting. She also asked me to pay for his gas! No! The first time I hired them, same issue. There was such a language barrier that I was not confident he understood what I was asking for to hang my TV’s and conceal the wires. He arrived to my home with no equipment to do the job and had to go and come back. She then messaged me asking could he come back tomorrow for the job AFTER they had canceled on me earlier that morning and I waited on them all day. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE ALL THE WAY AROUND. I WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN!"
1,Constant rescheduling of install project without communication. I had to reach out in order to find out status. Horrific communication and service.
4,I gave 4 stars mostly because the grout on the floor probably wasn’t mixed very well and the color is uneven so we’ve got someone coming out to fix it. That being said I feel like they’re very honest and trustworthy and Alex was very nice and polite with my mother. Overall my mother was happy with her bathroom and she said she would use them again for other projects in the future
5,They did exactly what we said. They fixed everything we needed. Thank you!
4,"It looks a lot better! It was more than I was anticipating, especially since it changed from a drywall repair job to a paint job, but overall I am just glad it’s done."
2,I had a window that I believed to need a seal repair due to temperature fluctuations in the room on the 3rd floor of my townhome. It should be a simple repair once the leak location is identified and the wonderful reviews made me believe they would be able to perform the work. They quoted me $120 before his arrival. The

1,"I arranged an installation of Christmas Lights with A++ Handy Services but they are NOT so Handy at all. They requested to move the original appointment out and set a new day and time , I accepted their request immediately. They just did not show for the appointment or provide an excuse. Really Bad All Round Service"
4,"Leo and his colleague arrived on time on a Sunday morning and were very efficient in completing my three small home repair tasks within one hour. They gave helpful advice on how to choose a new ceiling fan to possibly buy to replace my old one. I'll certainly consider them for future work. Only negative point was a cancellation of our first appointment on Saturday morning by them at the last minute, due to what they said was a busy schedule."

5,"May 18, 2022 Hello, my name is Teresa I contacted ""Ricky"" regarding fixing my Fence Gate. He told me he could come on 5/17/22 at 3:30pm. I arrived at 3:15pm and ""Ricky"" had just pulled up too. (15' early). He was a super nice guy and worked on our gate for almost 2 hours.  After he was finished the Gate was fixed. I had asked him if he could put 2 handles on but he did not have them with him. He said he would run to Home Depot and get them. I told him I wanted to leave (as I was there with him for the 2 hours), this was our Rental Property. I paid him and trusted that he would come back to install the 2 fence gate handles. I told him to please send me photos after he comes back and finishes. So at 5:45pm he texted me the photos of his completed work. VERY PROFESSIONAL and VERY TRUSTWORTHY!. He could have left and not come back (because I already paid him) but he left, went to Home Depot in horrible traffic (5pm is the worst time) but he still kept his word and did a great job!!!!!!!!!"
5,Very great personality compared to others in the same field I ran across. Take time do a good job and good communication skills. Will definitely be hiring for next project soon.
5,"Ricky was extremely helpful, very courteous and professional. He took care to make sure that the water heater that he installed was working properly. He called after an hour to make sure that the heater was functioning properly. I highly recommend Ricky for any plumbing jobs. Excellent work. Thanks again for your excellent service."
5,Really good experience. I was extremely impressed with the quality of his work. Will be calling him again for the rest of my honey-do list.
5,I had a great experience with Rick. He fixed my shower faucet in a timely manner.

5,He is incredible and precise but also quick. He mounted two TVs for me and was respectful of my schedule and time.   Will hire him again!
5,Ricardo installed 3 sinks and the installation was perfect. Highly recommend him for home projects or repairs.
5,"Ricky was super professional, and responsive . He took his time to make sure everything was installed properly even tackled a few other tasks I needed done around my home. I have him coming back next week to start a new project. I will continue to use his services."
5,Ricky was professional and provided quality work. He has repaired and replaced multiple items in my home over the last year. I highly recommend him!
1,Never will I hire this so call
1,"I had high hopes of having a great experience with this contractor. Unfortunately, he appears to be very disorganized and very unreliable. We set up an appointment for an estimate on Sunday afternoon. The appointment time came and went with no him not showing up. I ended calling him an hour after the scheduled appointment time and he said he was on his way. He finally showed up three hours late.  The following Tuesday he texted me asking my availability for the week. I told him I was available Wednesday and Friday morning. I didn’t hear back from him again until Friday morning telling me that we could “shoot” for the following Tuesday. He was told if he could give me a firm appointment for Tuesday we could do the job. Needless to say I never heard back from him and the job was never done. This a very poor way to run a business. Buyer beware!"

5,Ken from rains services is amazing! Not only do these people specialize in pressure washing but he is also a handy man! Ken helped me put up a closet shelf and curtains! They are very responsive and Ken is very knowledgeable when it comes to handy work! He comes in prepared to do any job and DOES NOT QUIT OR STOP UNTIL THE JOB IS DONE!!!! Even when I had a minor issue he had NO PROBLEM visiting again to make sure I am happy! I’m so glad I found him and we look forward to continue working with him! Welcome to the family Ken! And thank you for all you do!

5,He was on time and he did a great job .. really happy with my curtain bars. Would definitely call him again for future works. 5 ⭐️
4,Rain helped the same day replace a mailbox for my father. I was grateful for his quick response. His price was very fair. The only complaint I had was that was a huge piece of cement from he old mailbox was left behind near the curb. We had to pay another contractor to remove it as my sister and I do not live with my 82 year old father.
4,I like that they were in top of the communication to ensure service was provided in a prompt manner. He actually arrived ahead of time and was able to fix my garage front panel. The job was a little messy and he clean it after work. I give a four because the wall besides the area got all full of the glue and other material he was using and did not clean it until I ask him to please do it. But overall good job. Appreciated the service.
5,Great service kept me up to date on progress. Gutters cleaned and house are power washed. Exceptional job.

5,"Extremely professional, did a great job. Highly recommended."
3,"I requested pressure washing for my driveway, sidewalk, picket fence, and patio. I'd just say make sure you know what you're getting with the quote. The scheduler and serviceman were nice, but there were a couple things I didn't care for. I was told the service person would arrive at 7:30AM, and he didn't arrive until around 9AM, and there was no communication at all saying he'd be late. He only apologized after I asked whether he knew he was supposed to arrive at 7:30AM. Overall, he did a good job, but a few days later I realized he only did the inside of the fence. When I requested a quote, I said I had a picket fence, and to me, requesting pressure washing for a fence would be the whole fence (both sides). When I contacted the scheduler saying only one side was done, she said the service person is not allowed to go into the neighbor's yard or on the area where the lake is, but, he could come back to do that side if I paid $100 more. My fence is not shared with a neighbor, so there would have been no problem for him to walk around the exterior (if he was concerned, he could have asked me about that, but didn't). The scheduler said I didn't tell them I needed a double-sided fence done. But, isn't every fence double-sided? To me, when I ask for my fence to be cleaned, I'm asking for the entire fence. The least they could have done was clarify whether I needed one side or both sides of the fence done. I also didn't appreciate that the scheduler mentioned it costs them $40 to give me a quote; it's kind of unprofessional and I wasn't sure if she was trying to use that to make me feel like now I need to use them. So, they did a good job with what they did in terms of the quality of pressure washing, but it definitely wasn't clear about the appointment time or the extent of what they would do. I'm now the owner of half of a nicely pressure washed fence (and thankfully a well pressure washed driveway, sidewalk, and patio)."
2,I stated the residence was 3 stories. Needed windows and mildew removed from fascia/overhang. Ken did not have proper extension ladder so could not reach mildewed areas my main concern. Very disappointed.
5,"Easy, quick turnaround for gutter cleaning and a great price!"
2,"I have a two story building which needed the gutters cleaned. I had a few estimates of the exact same amount of $200, so to be fair, I picked the first company that gave me that same price. The person showed up pretty much on time, but with only a step ladder (no where tall enough) and a leaf blower. Ok, so we let him use our tall ladder and whatever else was needed.   After hours, and one incident where he got himself stuck on the roof because the ladder fell over (who knows how that happened) we were informed that he could not do one side of our house because the roof was too steep (he slipped and almost fell off, he said) and the ladder did not reach. Then, I was called to ask if I would be ok with him not doing that whole side, and I replied that we are paying for the whole house to be done. That’s what we were quoted for.  Anyway, they then sent another person to see what could be done and finished the job. Turns out they used their van and put our tall ladder on top of the van and reached the gutters that way. Completely unsafe, but we didn’t realize this until they were just about finished and we checked.  Next thing I hear is that they were going to charge an extra $70 because they said our house needs some kind of lift and they took longer than expected. Now mind you, the first thing you can see driving up to our house is how tall it is on one side. If there was an issue, the right thing to do would have been to tell me upfront that they could not do the job or couldn’t do it as quoted. We would have then had a choice to continue or hire someone else, but they decided it wasn’t s problem and started. It didn’t become a problem until 3/4 of the job was done.  I argued that I shouldn’t have to pay extra, because they quoted a price and they could have just declined the job, after seeing our house. After back and forth, I ended up paying $240, as I am not completely unreasonable, but I don’t feel like I should have been guilted into paying extra, especially after the mess they left. All other quotes were including bagging up and removal of debris. Rain’s doesn’t seem to do that.   The kicker, though, is that they started a case with Thumbtack, saying I hadn’t paid A WEEK LATER! I have proof of payment, of course, and have sent all the info to Thumbtack.  I am attaching some photos of the mess they left on just one side of the house (all those leaves came from the gutters). If I find the photos of all the leaves they blew onto our pool screen, I’ll add them, but I can’t find them at the moment. And, all the leaves and dirt blown onto our pool deck.  Moral here is to make sure they can do the job for the price quoted, before they start. If you don’t, they may put you in the position of paying extra, because what are you going to do if they’ve already done most of the work. Also, they need to have their own ladders and proper equipment, as well as clean up after themselves."
1,"If it is possible you should pick someone else. This “company” is unable to fulfill its commitment for services agreed upon. I secured an initial appointment for Monday and supposedly there was a missing part so it could not be put together without it. I was charged $30 for the visit no assembly done. When I received the replacement part the “company” had scheduling issues and sent someone else to get it done but he was unable to figure it out so he left without doing anything but moving a few pieces of the furniture to the top of the bed. So now I’m out $30 and don’t have anything to show for it but this experience. Again, don’t waste your time hiring this person."
1,"Had two shelves hung. Within a month the bottom one fell off the wall while I was in the bed. Damaged the shelf and wall. I sent Rain’s Services a message and was blamed for the damages and they proceeded to ignore my messages. Had to escalate the situation with Thumbtack to get them to take responsibility for their work. They finally reimbursed the $90 cost for the project and $50 to cover broken parts to repair the shelf. Each screw was to hold 80lbs. There are 3 screws. A basket of socks and desk supplies weighing maybe 5 pounds in total ripped the shelf off the wall. When you hire a professional, you expect them to do quality work and take accountability when the work is subpar. I had to threaten a lawsuit to get my money back and will never do business with this company again. Be sure to ask about a warranty, which for me was only a 24 hour guarantee after they left the job site!"
5,"For sure will recommend them to my friends, them deserve the mouth trust."
5,Very professional with the work  One of the best  Highly recommend

5,We were very lucky to have David. The project was about a week long. Our house was a short sale one and had lots of problems. Walls were broken and many stuff did not work at all. David fixed all the problems and made the house look like new. He built a new wall to make an extra bedroom and added a new roof for our patio. The most important part is that the costs were low. David always find ways to repair things at low costs. All my family members like David. He is an excellent
5,Dave and his brother did a great job painting my home. He also fixed a few spots on my wall and recommended doing a few other jobs! I highly recommend and will definitely be using his service in the future!!
5,"Our previous contractor, someone that we knew through family and friends abandoned our project after receiving 2/3 of his estimated costs for the project up front. ( A costly lesson that we will not make again.) He left our project in a terrible mess and us holding the bag for about 10k worth of work started but not completed.  After his abandoning our project I went to the internet to look for a contractor who might be able to finish our disaster. It was there that I stumbled across an app called Thumbtack and found Dave and his crew at “RTLPhillips inc.”  Dave brought professionalism and a sense of purpose to our project. He gave us vision on the best way that we should proceed to remedy the horrible situation that we had been left in. He let us know how he intended to do things and what we might expect. He and his great crew then proceeded to quickly and expertly renovate the exterior of our home. Dave’s attention to detail is meticulous. The speed with which he and his crew were able to replace every bit of rotten wood on our 70’s home, his most excellent carpentry work in doing so, his design and paint color selection advice and brother Paul’s paint job, one the finest I’ve witnessed ever, made working with RTLPhillips inc. a real pleasure. Thank you so much Dave and crew. You saved us from our disaster. We will of course call you first for our future projects and now wish to give you our most heartfelt thanks for everything and highest recommendation possible to you and your company!"
5,They did a great job and we had a good amount of projects that needed to be done. Would definitely hire them in the future.
2,Attention to detail. Evaluate the finished state and work to that.

5,Very efficient and friendly service at a fair price
5,Dave came out the next day to give me a quote and he and his team fixed our issue the next day! We had been dealing with other contractors who would give us quotes and then never show up. He and his team were very professional and did an outstanding job. They cleaned up everything and were very detail oriented. I highly recommend them!
5,RTL did an excellent job repairing a damaged wall in my home and helped me with a couple of other things along the way.  I’m definitely thinking of hiring them for other improvements in my home. I would highly recommend their services.
5,"Couldn’t be happier with the work these brothers did in my house! Having just experienced a horrible time dealing with contractors, David and his brothers were a breath of fresh air! And they were extremely fast while making sure what I requested was completed the exact way I wanted! Exceeded my expectations! A job well done and I highly recommend their services!"
5,"Selling a house and Dave was quick to come out and take a look at what needed repairs, and recommend what should be done right away, and what we should perhaps wait for the inspection to take care of. Him and his crew did a great job and got it done 2 days after we originally met!"
5,Very efficient and friendly service at a fair price
5,RTL contracting did an excellent job giving our 1990 built home a complete face lift. We hired RTL to paint our home and modernize our round columns to square and install new out door perimeter lighting. Dave and his team were very responsive and provided a day by day update on the process and the next steps in the 2 week renovation. The project was completed on time with beautiful results. RTL contracting is not cheap but you pay for what you get. I will definitely hire Dave for my future home renovation needs.
5,Dave and his crew did an awesome job on my bathroom. From rebuilding walls behind the old shower to flooring and painting. Dave listened to what I wanted and made suggestions. The end result is that I am thrilled with the bathroom and the price was right!
5,"FANTASTIC JOB!!! These guys are the real deal. Professional, thorough, and efficient. I would recommend them to anyone, everyone!!"
5,They did a great job repairing stucco cracks and repainting my entire house. It's apparent they know what they're doing. Also appreciated the fact that they showed up on time and kept me in the loop if they couldn't make it (had to work around rainstorms which is understandable). Would definitely hire again.
5,"Dave and his brothers did an amazing job. They are really nice guys, and you can tell they know their stuff. We had a patio ceiling to be replaced and I had others who either proposed panels, which would sag, or didn't give me confidence they wouldn't shoot holes into the attic. Dave clearly knew what he was doing and the job was done top-notch... beautiful. His rate was higher than the others, but for specialty projects like this one I would highly recommend him. You could tell he and his brothers cared about the work, which meant a lot and reassured us it would be spectacular."
5,"Dave and his brother did an excellent job in my house. They installed an electric fireplace and a wine rack in the wall, framed, stone tiled it, and replaced the lighting. They also installed a new tile backsplash in the kitchen. Their attention to detail, excellent vision and craftsmanship puts them above the rest of the contractors. Dave communicated very professionally: always answered my questions promptly and guided me if I needed help with a decision. Even though my timeline to finish the job was tight, Dave and his brothers worked diligently and finished the project ahead of schedule. I definitely recommend Dave to anyone who is looking for a quality contractor. Their price may be higher but the beautiful workmanship and a great customer service are worth the price tag."
5,Dave came out promptly to help in an emergency when the ceiling over my patio collapsed one morning. He and his team made great recommendations to enhance the look of our patio ceiling and installed a beautiful tongue and groove ceiling. They also made appropriate repairs to the roof to ensure we wouldn't have a future problem. Pricing was fair and the work was well done.
5,Stucco sealed and repaired. Exterior paint applied. Excellent workmanship. I was very impressed with the quality of work and professionalism shown by David and his co-workers. I will definitely utilize the services again for future projects.
5,"David and his brothers did an excellent job for me on 2 occasions. They removed popcorn ceiling and painted. On the second trip they removed and hauled old nasty carpet and padding, counters, toilet, linoleum. What a mess! But they did it all. Great job, guys. Hire them. You won't be disappointed."
5,"Started my floor project and decided I didn't have the skills to complete. Got quotes through thumtack and decided to go through David based on reviews. David wasn't the least expensive but you get what you pay for.   David was able to come in two days after the quote to start the project. This was on a Sunday! I felt David cares about his work, his reputation, and the people he is working for.  The new year is just around the corner and I'll be contacting David for several other remodeling projects."
5,"We tried our hand at putting down laminate flooring and soon realized we needed help. I had called a few places but never got my calls returned. I found thumbtack and as soon as I posted my need, Dave responded right away.  He even came out about an hour later to give me a quote and began work the next day.  Dave and his brother Paul were super nice, very knowledgable and skilled for the task. They got the job done quick and it looked great! The price was fair and included extras. I love my new floor!  While Dave was here, he had some great ideas for future projects in my home. When I'm ready for those projects, I will definitely call Dave again."
5,David and his brothers came out and did a spectacular job framing out a new room. They followed all precautions and completed the job beyond my expectations. Would highly recommend and will be using again in the future.
5,"If you are looking for personal professional repairs, remodeling or construction, LOOK NO FURTHER THAN ELITE! They have returned my bath to excellent condition, better than new. Their listening to my needs and surpassing them were terrific!"
5,Fast response! came out the same day and gave me a quote. They start the work the following day. They finished on time and the job looks very good. I am happy with the work performed and would use them again. I had 2 sheets of drywall installed around a fireplace remodeling with a recess for a built in TV.
5,David and Paul are very prompt and courteous. Their work is very professional. We were pleased with the work they did.  Yolanda Tankskey
5,"They replaced baseboards throughout our 2880 sq. ft house. They did this  work in three days the week of Thanksgiving. They had two kids, two  adults and four dogs to work around. We are very happy with the result.  Will call them again for other projects."
5,David rebuilt my dock with composite wood. It was great to work with a professional who follows through with everything that he said he was going to do. I will use him again in the future!
5,I highly recommend working with David and Paul. They are the most professional team that I ever worked with. They painted the interior of my home and every inch of it was done to perfection. They really care about doing things right. I will call them again for future projects. I love their work and they have my trust and confidence.
5,"Excellent!!! David was great. Numerous projects were completed sooner than expected and on short notice (painting, replace ceiling drywall, roof repair, etc). He was willing and able to take on additional unexpected projects and exceeded expectations. I would definitely recommend Elite Remodeling as well as use their services again."
5,David and Paul are very prompt and courteous. Their work is very professional. We were pleased with the work they did.  Yolanda Tankskey
5,"Very Prompt on getting to me to bid the job, very prompt on doing the job, Did a fantastic job for me. David Will be back to do more work for me in the future. Thank you"
4,Was fast to respond and came out to my home and completed the wall in one day. All of his guys were professional and the wall looked fantastic when completed. I was offered lower pricing after the job was completed by other contractors so compare pricing before you hire them to make sure it’s competitive.
4,"I had asked for pressure washing on my deck and the front of the house was added to the ticket at my request. The deck is still pretty dirty, but I asked them not to have the washer so high that it took the paint off, so they used a lower pressure that really didn't fully clean it. But is is not their fault, it is what I requested. So they did what I asked and completed the job in a timely manner."
4,"Dave & Paul did work in our master bedroom, removing the ceiling tiles that were there and redoing the drywall. They added a coffered ceiling which is beautiful. We love our new ceiling! Only thing keeping them from a 5-star rating is the amount of dust cleanup we had to do after the job."
4,Dave did a good job of getting an awkward roof job done. He did a good job at coordinating some sub-contractors as well. He did it at a fair price.
5,"Very Prompt on getting to me to bid the job, very prompt on doing the job, Did a fantastic job for me. David Will be back to do more work for me in the future. Thank you"

5,Got the work done quickly and correctly!
2,Better communication.
5,Great experience. We love our fireplace. The quality of work is impeccable.
5,"He was extremely prompt in returning my call. He also was on time, gave me an estimate and completed the work the next Day. The bill was exactly what he said before taking the floor up. I thought the job I needed was going to look like it was just repaired and not match at all. When he was done it was awesome. You would only know there was a repair if you knew it was damaged in the first place. I would definitely call him again for floor work and also general contracting work as well. Thank you Dave"
5,Great contractor. Would recommend best for things that require multiple types of trades or a little more complexity.
3,"We had some stucco repaired and some new spots to blend in. David responded promptly and completed the work quickly, but I thought it was pricey for the final result."
5,"David and Paul did a fantastic job! We love the work that they did. They were on time, professional and courteous. The project was completed as as scheduled and we absolutely love the results as does everyone else that comes into our home. The crown and base moulding make such a difference and the crowned accent shelf turned out perfect! We will definately be using David and Paul again for several more projects!"
5,Dave did a great job . He finished the job ahead of schedule . All work was quality .

2,"Not really happy with the amount of money I paid and the haphazard attitude about the mess I had to clean up with the stained tiles from the grout. It literally took hours to clean each tile. or the wrong electrical outlet put in or the paint job which still has touch ups needed. Or the floor that was left filthy after grouting and I was told to clean it. Or a problem area that needed tiling was ignored, or lay a wall across from my bathroom has speckles of paint chipped off. Especially as I paid, yes, $1000 a day."
4,"David was very nice and worked with us to get exactly what we wanted done. We had a wall added in our home with an added A/C vent. He framed in antique doors that we purchased. He was a great value for our money and really worked with us and within our budget. He went out of his way to help us. An area of improvement would be punctuality, but he did work within a short time frame because the wall was for a nursery! We would work with David again and recommend his work. Our wall and doors look amazing!"

5,"They attached two wall mounted, floating wooden shelves for us. We contacted them and they were able to come the same day after our prior handymen bailed on us!"
5,Communication was perfect and spot on. Excellent job on the work by the technician mounting 2 flat screen TVs and concealing the wires to 1 TV. They offer other services like assembling a king size bed but unfortunately on my end I didn't have the special bolts needed. The company deducted the amount from the initial invoice and they also stayed true to their pricing. I recommend using this company. They provided a 5 star experience. Many thanks 👍

5,"The technician was on the way but had something urgent to attend to. I received a call to reschedule for the next morning, but gave me a discount to make up for it. I would use them again."
5,Arash and his assistant were excellent. They were extremely professional and made sure each and every part was assembled correctly. A massive and complex job that completed perfectly.
5,"Let me begin by saying I was a little hesitant when I received the initial quote for the assembly because it was about a third of what the other companies were charging. Well, from start to finish the customer service is outstanding! They were always available when I had a question and when I had to reschedule. The gentleman, Arash, who came to assemble my tv stand was so kind and meticulous and NEAT. No mess for me clean up! Arash, did an outstanding job - I wish I could give him 10 STARS. Easy to work with, very respectful and all around wonderful guy. Don’t hesitate to use this company - you’ll be so happy you did!"
5,Tech did great job and finished quickly. The only issue was the tech texted at 11:45 and said he was on his way but didn’t show up until 1:45.

The technician came early ready to work with all his tools did an excellent job very nice very polite very courteous. Would definitely recommend and rehire them again on the future, Keep up the great work."
5,"The guy that put my patio furniture together did an outstanding job and charged a flat rate. He arrived the time he said he would. I was shocked the flat rate price was half of what other contractors charged and we were glad we went with them and they did an outstanding job, the next job we have at home I'll use them. Compare prices you will be shocked how affordable they are"

I am in the process of moving into the area, but still only in town every other weekend. I called today and requested service, which I knew might be challenging due to the short notice, but they made it happen and sent the best technician ever! Michael hasn't even started yet with the company, but drove an hour to take the job, which is an employee and service provider going above and beyond my expectations. Kudos to FixTman for hiring such a wonderful new employee and to them for delivering such fantastic service.   I HIGHLY recommend hiring them and will do so again myself in the near future."

Sam reached out to me first and made an extra effort to contact me when I was not answering my phone. He gave me prices up front, emailed a copy of an invoice and was able to schedule the service the next day. Arash texted me when he was on the way and arrived within the 2 hour window as promised. He told me the mirror needed to be hung on two studs because of the weight. After he found the studs, we had to move the dresser a little to center under the mirror. They slid the furniture around and cleaned up thoroughly after they finished. They were professional from the first contact through the final cleanup and I felt confident in their work. I am pleased with the service, will use them again and highly recommend them!!"

5,"Jerome arrived at exactly 10 am. From the moment he entered my apartment I felt confident that he was the man for the job of assembling my 2 drawer lateral file cabinet. He calmly laid out all the pieces. It looked like there were hundreds. He quietly and steadily worked until the task was completed. It only took him 1 hour and 45 mins to set up my cabinet. He actually wiped it off and inspected it to determine if it was assembled perfectly.  Jerome was organized, courteous, and helpful. He cleaned up and brought the trash to the trash disposal. When I need something else assembled, I will request him. Fantastic job!"
5,He was excellent. He came early which was great for me. He put the bike together very well. Showed me where things were and answered all my questions. It was a great experience.

My Proform carbon E7 elliptical machine was in its box forever and I knew I couldn’t assemble it myself. I mentioned it to my friend and she recommended thumbtack. I got an appointment right away , the price and service was great. Can’t wait to burn these Covid pounds off with my machine. Thank you Behn (the technician)"

5,Very professional and quick. All messages were answered on a timely manner and the service was fast and very well done. Technician was on time and very friendly. Cleaned up after himself and was very neat. 100% would recommend.
5,I loved everything from the experience with FixTman. They are very professional and kind. Communication was great (fast!) and easy scheduling. I'll hire them again for sure.
4,"The services were provided timely and professionally. Assembled a coffee table, installed a curtain rod and hung some pictures onto concrete walls."
4,"The work completed was excellent.   I did not like the rescheduling over and over. I do understand things happen but, the late evening, last minute cancellation killed my planning for that day. This would be my only complaint.   Also the visit they came to, I didn't receive a confirmation. I had to send the company a inquiry to confirm and that was after 9pm.   They did respond and I received the confirmation around 5am the morning of the appointment. The customer service is there and do pretty good, it's just these types of things that kill the review for me. Will I use them again if needed, yes.  The technicians were great. Arrived within the time frame and got right to work. Did a great job putting the cabinet together. Very neat, cleaned up everything. Made sure I received the manuals and all the extra parts in case needed later."

4,"Ali the person who hung 2 tv’s for me was amazing! Great job, on time & professional  Dealing with FixTman - 😑  I set up an appointment for 9am & then was texted that my appointment was for 11am  Asked to confirm the time change because my husband was going to take time off from work. Then was called from a CA phone # that I didn’t pick up because I didn’t know the number. Was texted that I was being called about a question about the job- answered the questions. Then texted about time change and $20 fee if canceled in less than 24 hours🤦🏻‍♀️. Then was told I had to cancel my 9am appointment so they could make the appointment for 10am. Agreed to everything even the time change, then at 6:02 am I get a text saying the person would be here at 9am. Honestly- the person did a 5 star job! Would hire him again but dealing with the service who makes the appointments & collects the money it isn’t worth it - they get only 2 stars"
5,This is the second time we were fortunate enough to have Arash as our technician. He is so good and executed exactly what our vision was for our gallery wall. He is so incredibly kind and thorough as well. The ultimate professional!
5,Everything was done so wonderfully. I had ordered a crib and changing table for my daughter and was so grateful to have it put up the right way! Will definitely recommend and use fixtman llc again and refer some friends of mine!

5,"Had a great experience with this company. Very respectful of our home and super nice. Mounted our TV and Sound Bar, looks amazing."
5,"This has to rate as one of my most positive experiences with an outside vendor that i have ever had. Behnam is a technician that knows his trade. First and foremost the quality of work is an absolute A+! The expert assembly made a rather inexpensive dresser look and feel like one that would cost 3 or 4 times as much. Then there were all the little peripheral things he did like being fully virus compliant, removing his shoes before walking on my rugs, and cleaning up after himself. This is the company to hire and Behnam is the one to request to do your job."
5,"Ahmad did an excellent job on my gallery wall! He hung up all 16 frames exactly how I wanted and finished his job quickly and quietly. Additionally, he hung up a large mirror in my room. Everything looks amazing and I’d hire again without a doubt."

5,Mr. Aresh was very pleasant to work with and able to calm any doubts and address and concerns I had at installation. He installed a 75” tv for me. I requested additional support for him considering it’s such a large tv and I was concerned -anticipating the worse. The additional support was at a minimal fee but well worth it to put my concerned at ease. Would definitely reach out to him on future install projects or refer him to others.
5,"I was told by this app from a teammate. The moment i put in what i was looking for I received a response right away. FixTman was professional, knowledgeable, and very hands on by asking me if this is where i wanted my TV set and so on. Thank you!"

I would highly recommend them for any assembly job you might not know how to do or have time to do yourself. Excellent work by Arash and his son who were our technicians."

5,"Great company, reasonable price and very professional! Highly recommend!"
5,"Thank you so much for great service! We had service for 2 TVs, one 70"" on a full swivel. My husband worked with the technician and he was very happy with the results, the quality of work and outcome of the installation. We have a tilt installed for the 50"" in our bedroom and the installation was also great work. However, we realized based on the position of the TV in the corner of our room we would not be able to see it. The tilt only goes up and down, which we also understood.  Therefore we had to contact FixTman for a second installation. We change the tilt to a full motion and now we are very happy with the results. Thank you! I would have appreciated taking this into consideration beforehand between my husband and the technician. However, between not being there myself at the time and misunderstanding languages, I have 4 holes in my wall and a tilt bracket I don't need. From the beginning, working with FixTman has been pleasant from our experience as customers. Our TVs are hung and secure and I will just have to cover the holes myself. Thank you to the technicians for taking the time to clean up thier work after they were done."

They matched a quote I received from someone else to mount my two TVs and and attempted to mount my headboard to my wall.   This company has great reviews.

My bed cane with 3 panels to be hung and take perfect measurements and attention to great detail. I stayed with him during intial setup and continued to referencing him to the instruction manual because he kept trying to figure it own his own or do it his own way. It took about 4 hours to install. I had to leave to work in which I went upstairs to check before hand. From a quick glance it appeared to be fine. My mother called me when she arrive and said one of the panels were uneven. When I returned home, I took a better look and realized it was all wrong. One panel bracket was coming off the wall causing it to lean forward. The other panel he stuffed with something because the panel was not hanging on the bracket (due to incorrect measurements). The last panel I guess he gave up lol and the bracket was completely crooked and unleveled. I went to sleep with pillow surrounded my head Incase one fell so it would break the fall 😂. I sent a message to the company with photos which they immediately responded and they wanted to send the"

5,"100% satisfied. Came, worked well and left. Easy as 123"
5,Good trustworthy
4,"Initially was going to drill holes in drywall for lightweight picture hanging until I objected - besides from that, very detail-oriented and professional. Very happy with the outcome."
5,"Pirooz did a great job---he was thorough, careful, and a pleasure to deal with. We would definitely use him again."
1,"The tech said I had to buy a new, bigger tv to be able to not see the bracket when the tv is up against the wall. After he left I read the manual and learned the bracket can be lowered. He agree to come back to fix it. I called and texted a few times to follow up but he did not reply. Then I reached out to FixTman and a follow up visit was scheduled. He did not show up. Another appt was scheduled. He did not show up. I then requested a refund and FixTman said he would give it to me. When I finally spoke to him he insisted he come back and said he didn't have the power to give me my money back. I said ok. One last try. He came. This time he said the tv was not heavy enough for the bracket. I found this to be a ridiculous excuse. I told him that made no sense. The bracket is designed for the size tv I have and he is the one who said the bracket was the right one. Anyway, he left and came back with another bracket. Finally, the job was done right. I get mistakes happen but the excuses are not acceptable. Did he really believe that I would accept the tv is not heavy enough?! He is nice enough when he shows up but the entire experience was horrible."
1,We had the work done by FixTman Inc. reviewed the results were that your work was a fire hazard. We had to pay another $ 200.00 to fix the improper wiring.
1,I would give zero stars if I could. Confirmed appointment for 11 am- 2pm and then cancelled at 1:57pm. Super unprofessional. This is the second time a technician from their company canceled on an appointment last minute. Do NOT hire!!
5,Great job assembling my son's loft bed. It looks great!

1,"This is horrible company do not do business with them they have me waited two consecutive days no one ever showed ,very unprofessional stay away from them .they will waste your time"
1,Typical bate and switch scammer. When I clicked to hire these clowns the price was $75 an hour which is what they advertised on Thumbtack. Then they contacted me and told me $90 and tried to hack up the price. They are u professional and call from weird phone numbers. Be very weary of this company as they are not honorable.
5,"Wonderful experience with Pirooz. Personable, punctual and great attention to detail. Would definitely recommend!"
1,We all have busy lives. So when you get rescheduled on TWICE it does more than just upset you. This company rescheduled my service two days in a row. After I hired a babysitter for both days. Now I’m out $ and my housework still isn’t complete. Total waste of time.
1,"The technician was very slow. I had 2 small ikea drawers assembled and he took double the time as the last person who assembled the same model for me. When he said the drawers were done, there was a 2 inch gap in one of them that I had him fix. Then, he told me because he had another job to get to and because it took so long, he couldn’t assemble the third piece he was scheduled to assemble. This is unacceptable. I booked this appointment for 3 pieces, and only 2 were assembled. I would have hired someone else if I knew the job wouldn’t have been completed. Horrible customer service."

4,"Mr Ali was punctual and had a great sense of understanding of what it took putting together the Fitness  Equipment that my son purchased. The Equipment was very tedious and it took lots of time and Patience, of which we he showed. Very knowledgeable!"
4,UPDATE: I am updating my review to 4 stars. After seeing my review the company reached out to me to explain the situation I had with the amount of time it took to complete the job. Customer service rep was really responsive and listened to me as I explained the issue. I really felt that they were willing to do whatever it takes to make a customer happy.   ORIGINAL REVIEW: The technician assemble the desk well but they sent one person to assemble a six drawer cabinet at 5pm. It took five and a half hours to finish. The guy was here until 10:30pm and would not take a hint. Really needed to send more people or give me an idea of time. It was an extremely slow process. Then upon finishing immediately started bugging me for a review. they did a good job assembling everything but I wouldn't use this company again.
5,"Friendly, efficient, and high quality work!"

1,"I started out looking for someone to hang pictures. I found FixTman. Then I asked if he could also hang a chandelier. He said yes. We agreed on a price for both. He sent a person to do the work. I told him to start on the chandelier. He went to look at the directions on the box. I asked him if he knew what to do. He said he had to call the office and went out to his car to do it. Then he got in the car and left. The company called to reschedule, but I didn’t want to. I went with a different picture hanger and a different chandelier hanger."

1,This company is totally unorganized. I requested service and explained what I needed done clearly via text and pictures. One of their workers came to my home and said that he couldn’t do it alone and the company called me and told me that they would have to charge extra to hire another person. Then they called me and told me that they didn’t have anyone with a high enough ladder . Ridiculous and unorganized bit was quick to charge my card before service!

2,"UPDATE: After hearing about my experience, Fixtman did everything they could to make things right for me and I really appreciate their efforts. They went over an beyond, via phone and text to make sure they captured my concerns and they were responsive throughout. They didn't stop until I was satisfied and they were very thorough, patient and kind to me even though I was visibly upset and that speaks to their professionalism and commitment to customer service. The experience I had with them rectifying my concern is the reason why I will return again. Thank you Charles for being super patient and really trying to make things right, which Fixtman did!!!    Horrible! Just horrible!! Ali was the worse!! I worked with this company about 3 weeks ago and they did a great job with my bed and barstools so I came back again for a couch and desk and I wish I didn’t do it. Lesson learned. Ali left in the middle of a job and even left not only the trash of the desk with nails on the floor and the unfinished couch, but apparently while I was in work meetings he found my snacks and drinks too and helped himself and left that on the floor before he left!!!!!! I didn’t see that part of it until he left and I am pissed and furious!!! Disgusting!! Will never use their service and to think I tipped him 40 bucks for their last job!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬"

1,They came in and after 2 seconds from entering my house they raised the price $50. I call the headquarters to tell them about it and we settle it for $20 (even though it felt like a scam) but since I had already plan to have someone there while they put it together I decided to pay more.

1,"If you want quality these guys aren’t going to cut it. The project was to sink 4 post with no concrete bc I didn’t want it permanent. So while I wasn’t here they just cut the ends off my posts, set them on the ground, and threw a couple screws in it. The tops literally move 8”. And as you can also see the tension fabric is minus the tension. When I get home and see his work I’m absolutely flabbergasted that this is the final product presented. I expressed it was unacceptable and all I got was excuses. Total waste of my supplies and the $400 it the guys cost me. Funny part of it is this took them 5 hours. Just the four posts… Furthermore more there was no make it right in anything he said going forward. He literally said “if it falls down or something I’ll come fix it”. I got took on this one."

5,"The backyard fence that I had was getting old and needed to be replaced, so when I saw this guy working for my neighbor. I asked if he can come and have a look to the fence. He was kind enough to come and have look. He gave me a free estimate and when he is available to come. After we agreed, he told me that it would take 3 days, but he finished the job in two days. Overall I had a great experience and I would recommend him to anyone who needs some work around the house."

I wasn’t expecting such prompt service considering the holiday, but everything I needed done was professionally done that morning, and I will definitely use Agile Movers again for any work. In fact, I just referred them to someone else.  Adam did an excellent job hanging several pictures and assembled a table for me. His work saved me at least a few hours that I would have wasted trying to get it all done on my own."
5,"They were very communicative about their timeline for arrival, which is appreciated. Attentive to my asks, and executed efficiently and effectively. Also, my provider was personable and kind and so helpful. Would recommend and will be using again."

5,"I booked my move about a week before I needed it and luckily they had availability on the weekend at an affordable price! Adrian and Miguel were my movers and they did a great job. They showed up on time even with rainy weather, wrapped up my belongings that needed protection and moved the contents of a 3/2 out of second story apartment and large storage unit, into a two story home all within 5 hours. I would highly recommend Agile Movers to anyone looking for an efficient and affordable moving service."

The young man that came to my new apartment was very professional and completed the job quickly and perfectly. I am now enjoying my adjustable base bed during this cold frigid weather. I am a very satisfied customer!
2,"I would not recommend Agile movers, I’m not trying to be rude but they took a long time to eat up time so that I had to pay for an extra hour after asking them to decrease the amount of workers so that it was more affordable and they also broke stuff."
5,Great job got here a bit early and finished it quick and exactly what I wanted. Removal of all fixtures
2,Firstly I want to commend the excellent response rate and communication from the Admin side. They were quick to also fix a job badly done.  I had Adam come home a do a few things around the home.   He was keen on finishing the job as soon as possible and not necessarily on doing a clean and a professional job.  For example. He installed 2 toilet paper holders for us.  Both of them came right off within the first day of use !!  When he installed them. He went on to cover the holes of the older ones. I could have done as bad a job as he did.   When they came off. He came back and drilled another set of holes and reinstalled the holder. This time he left the previous holes he made completely untouched.    The third time he came back in. He did not seem to think what was quiet obvious to the naked eye that it was an ugly job.   He had to be told firmly that the expectation was quiet simply that it looked like a professional did it.    I do not recommend him.  Otherwise the admin is great and they are effective.
5,On time. Worked diligent toward the goal. Professional!!
2,Nice person but wasn’t able to install the safety baby gate well in front of my staircase. I have to find someone to fix it properly.
5,This was the best experience I have ever had with a move.
5,On time. Job was complete as asked. Very happy with this choice.
5,"The mover was fast, friendly and ultra experienced. He was very professional and his work was high quality!"
3,"Pro was very responsive, but very unprofessional and overpriced. I had a simple platform bed assembly in which his price was $50/hr with a minimum of 2 hr, or if the job was 1hr, the price was $75 plus a $25 travel fee. (Sidebar… Wayfair was only charging $80, but I would have had to wait until the following week) When I inquired about the travel fee he/she responded with “Look….” As if to say listen mam… this is the price. Needless to say I respectfully declined his service and found another pro that was willing to come to me the same day and complete the job for $65 and no travel fee."
5,He was great. He knew what he was doing. Fast and polite
5,Super Quick. He took everything off the uhual & assembled my bed in less than a hour. Thank you so much!
1,"This guy came in at 8:30 and rushed through the whole assembly. He left a whole mess in my house and didnt even offer to clean up. By the time he left i saw my walls chipped where he brought the furniture and my room walls scratched, where he assembled the furniture. This is the mist horrible service you could ever get. Honestly t"

5,The packing was really fast and they were helpful in sorting items as well.
5,Awesome service! Fast and efficient! Highly recommend.
2,"Pros:  + They pack my up my stuff quickly in the U-haul boxes I provided.  +.They moved systematically from one room to the next.  + They wrapped fragile stuff well.  + they worked for almost 8 hours straight.   Cons:  - Skimped on tape on boxes even though I supplied plenty for them. Especially poor on picture frame boxes. I had to re-tape all of them.  - Did not add crushed paper to fill to top off contents which caused some boxes to collapse when stacked.  - missed one kitchen drawer.  - they did not schedule a lunch break so I bought them lunch and forced them to take a break.  After opening some of the picture boxes, found damage to one of my valuable oil paintings and a max of 2 painting per box. I had also insisted they put adding between paintings and they did not. One box had 2 framed oil paintings and 4 framed prints stack in the same narrow U-Haul picture box with no padding."
5,They were definitely “agile”! Everything went smoothly and I will definitely use their services again.
5,Great job and very friendly.

1,"**Update 1/5/2022  The business owner reached out to me and told me it was my fault that the frames are crooked. He said the contractor, Miguel, offered to fix it but I declined. I explained to the owner multiple times that I told Miguel I DO NOT WANT MORE HOLES DRILLED.   Instead of Miguel saying ""I can fix it without drilling holes and I can use a shimmy"", he decided to be LAZY and say ok. I had ZERO knowledge that it could be fixed without additional holes. So now it is MY fault that my frames are crooked.   Although I did not use this service for the full two hours, I still paid the amount, got Miguel coffee AND tipped him (bc it was the right thing to do, to tip someone for their service).   The owner promised he would send someone over to adjust the frames and never responded back to me about setting a date. But when I first inquired about their services, MAN they responded REAL quick, less than five mins. I wrote a message telling them to please do the RIGHT thing and he went off on me. So GHETTO, UNPROFESSIONAL, LAZY, money hungry bunch of people. It's my fault that your contractor doesn't know how to measure. OKAY.   You guys can read our messages. I was not rude AT ALL in my message asking them to do the right thing. But we all know how men can be with their sensitive little egos. Got all upset bc he was told the job was not done well.  Original post: It was ok. They responded immediately, came on time. I wanted six photo frames hung up. Two rows of 3. They’re not straight. He offered to fix it, but there’s no point. If you move it, then you’ll see the hole that was already drilled. I don’t have plaster to seal it up. Could’ve done better measuring and marking before drilling."

3,"The crew took 12 hours to set up an office space. They had 3 benches , 1 desk , 4 cameras , and 3 curtains to hang up.   They flirted with 3 of my employees instead of doing work. They laid on the floor for long periods of times. They went outside to throw out trash and took 30 minutes each time to do so. They did this a total of 7 times.   They also threw away packaging that end up costing me another $140 because the wrong rods were bought.   They came back to the work place unannounced the next day and subpar job putting on the door.   I would never recommend this company.   The posters are crooked, the cameras are wobbly.   The whole thing cost me $900.   I would never recommend this company."

1,"Hired Edier for a remodeling job, he tells me that it would take 10 days. Well 10 days turned into 30 days. . He made multiple unwanted advances towards me. One telling me he would build shelves in my closet if I allowed him to take me on a date, another time being when he was supposed to come back and fix my shower tile flooring that they NEVER sealed and completed, he comes to my residence and after leaving that night he text me “I like you”, not “How’s the floor”. So it showed me he has other motives. Another thing EDIER does, he will tell you 30% is due up front, but then charge your card every week “to pay his workers” is what he says after I pulled him up about it and demanded a refund of the unauthorized charges. He hung my light fixtures for me and once I started pointing out issues he through it in my face saying he did things for “FREE”, but he only did those things with hopes he’d get something out of it other than money! He initially told me he was going to do some of my flooring at a discounted rate, but then charged me full price only after I declined his advances and purchased all of my material. The paint job on my cabinets were done with spray and they were poorly finished. The beautiful tile floor I purchased to have them lay he left my baseboards looking a mess and I had to point it out to him. I paid another one of his guys to properly do my ceiling because he wanted to rush it himself and paint over wood that needed to be sanded. Overall I do not recommend him and IF YOUR A FEMALE STAY AWAY BECAUSE HE WILL TRY TO MAKE UNWANTED ADVANCES TOWARDS YOU!! Just look at the pictures I’m uploading the proof is in the pudding, very unprofessional!!!!   As you see in the text I was lied to multiple times about the completion date just to get me to pay more  As reflected in the picture he changed my estimate once he saw it was all business with me as well . No pleasure !!   As of now I am stuck with getting my shower floor replaced on my own and my grout/ base boards redone. He refused to give me a refund for any bit."
5,"I called them in a panic after attempting to paint my cabinets on my own, they came in a timely fashion and completed the job with no hesitation, very professional!"
5,He did good work and was on time and professional. Great attitude and I would recommend him
5,Excellent experience

5,"JT Repairs came to my house to fix my front porch light fixture. Initially, I thought it was just the bulbs which needed replacing. However, we had to replace the entire fixture. He, therefore, returned a second time to take out the old fixture and install a new one. He was prompt and his costs were reasonable. He didn’t leave until we checked to make sure that the fixture was in working condition. I would definitely use him again and would recommend him for any"
5,"Very professional. Quick response, good communication, arrived on time. Did the work quickly, let me know when there were issues or questions. Made some great suggestions. Would absolutely use him again."

5,"Great repair work on my wall. Furniture movers put a good hole in my wall and gashed out another. Response was prompt and he came out on Saturday to fix my walls.   Initially I thought the price was high but after watching him work I understood. He did a quality repair, not something quick and cheap that was obviously repaired. Cut out the damaged drywall, put wooden backing for new piece, cut out new drywall, secured and then multiple rounds of sanding, spackle, drying, spackle again, dry, sand then finally texture.  I asked him not to paint bc mine doesn’t touch up well. All in all he spent a little over 2hrs making sure it was as close to new looking as possible.   I plan to have him do some other small jobs as well."
5,Had a chipped door and tried to fix it myself and JT came through I’m less than an hour and got it done immediately. Highly recommend
5,"JT was a Godsend. I complained to my HOA about a lot behind my home that was not being kept. Vultures were actually taking over my back brick wall from the lot which meant that there was something dead on the lot behind my home. The birds were hugh, scary & unclean which is a major health concern. From a reliable source, I was advised to purchase bird spikes, and JT strategized on how to best seal spikes to brick wall. It was a tedious and tiring project but JT completed effortless. I’ve only had one sighting of the bird in a tree and not in my backyard. The immediate problem has been resolved along with a citation from the county to the owner of unkept lot."

5,JT was very responsive and made the repair quickly.
2,"Reached out to the professional 2 weeks back. sent him photos of the project/door to be fixed. He gave a quote and made an appt to look at it and possibly do it. Came last Tuesday to look at it. He said it is more than what he thought and gave new quote. I agreed to it. He wanted to come back another day to do it which we agreed to . No news hence... On reaching out, he said,I will reach out to the tenant. Finally gave a new date to do the work. The new date was yesterday. Still no news.... After repeated calls and texts, he informed me nothing! texted the tenant to look for someone else!. If something is not the best choice for you Sir, please let the client know ,so that they can move on with their things. Please don't commit and then do a disappearing act. I reached out to you after reading your reviews.Unfortunately my experience was disappointing."
5,good service
1,"Absolutely unreliable. Agreed to do the job and did not call or show-up. I had to text him. He stated that it didn’t mean that he would not do the job, just that he forgot. Wow! Wasted my time on a project that I told him was on a tight deadline. Save yourself some time and headache, get a real pro. He is not it."

5,Thank you very much came out the same day as the call super great. Thank you.

I indeed did reply AND sent a text this morning to confirm he was coming along with asking about payment method. He hadn’t even checked his messages because it was there. His response when he saw it was just “my bad”. Didn’t offer to make it right."

He is an extremely hard worker; I had lots of small jobs needing to be done (curtain rods, towel rails, pictures, a medicine cabinet etc.) and I was very impressed with how much he got done in a relatively short amount of time. Everything looks great and I'm extremely satisfied. I cannot recommend Alberto and On Point Construction highly enough."

Now, 6 months later she assumes I had a “bad day” when I left the review I would not trust this person in the future for any services based off how she treats her customers. Stay VERY far away from her. I attached the text message screen shots to view.   Kiana was very responsive when I reached out to her. Unfortunately we didn’t feel like the the"

5,Our Tech George was very punctual and texted his ETA. A very pleasant young man. He diagnosed our problem on the Ice Maker(water intake valve was rusted out) but needed to come back a couple of days later to replace the part. I got a call the following day to schedule an appointment for part install. Again punctual and tidy. We also needed a new water filter so he picked one up and brought it back later in the day. The visit was pricey but what isn't nowadays and now have the refer working properly and hopefully for years to come.

Side note, I soldered on the LED SMD myself and fixed the light which they quoted $130 that they couldn’t get. The temperature sensor ($150?) was not replaced."

2,I would give them high marks for the speed of scheduling someone to come out and the techs were on time both visits. But the language barrier was so significant that I wouldn’t recommend them.

They both looked blankly at me and replied I just needed to make decision. So we proceeded. After the

5,Wow✅ thank you so much for fixing our dryer on a Saturday!! We had wet clothes in there and were so worried about the dryer and it overheating! Thankful you were able to fix it for us very quickly. 😀👏
4,Didn’t like that he charged an extra amount to use a credit card. The better approach would be to charge the full amount upfront and give discount if one uses cash. I felt that he was scamming me even though that might be the agency’s actual policy.

5,"They were quick to schedule, showed up on time and were very thorough."
5,He was very nice and explained exactly what was going on in my fridge. Finished promptly.
3,2 guys showed up at my house. They moved the refrigerator out and started doing diagnostics. Although they were having a discussion they were not speaking english so I have no way of knowing if they were discussing the results they were seeing or something else. Then when they were done with the diagnostics I was informed that I needed a compressor. They replaced the compressor at considerable cost and gave me a 30 day warranty. I had to write a check because they did not want to pay the credit service charges. It has only been 12 days and now I am getting noises from the refrigerator. When I contacted them I was told that it was probably something else and a technician would have to diagnose it. I am going to contact another company and have it looked at as I do not feel comfortable with doing business further with these guys. It may be unrelated but I have a very uncomfortable feeling about it.

They wanted to upsell me on their compressor to the tune of $1200 not disclosing the warranty on my unit. I discovered the warranty at Home Depot and confirmed with LG. So they would have profited off of the extra $400, I would have paid, then turned back on the manufacturer and received a new compressor for FREE! I will be disputing my charge! He also damaged my Brazilian Cherry floors! I may need to go after them for that as well!"

I have an air duct that came out of my fridge and I just needed it to be put back in. This guy first tells me it doesn’t go to my fridge. Then he asks why I want it put back in. Then he told me you don’t call a repairman and tell him what to do. Rudest guy I’ve ever worked with in my life.
5,Dimiti was great! Thank you so much. Was quick help diagnose and solved the problem and offer to help if need be in the future.

1,"Well where do I start and keep this under five pages long!! First of all I wish I could give them zero Stars it was about a four month or more process they diagnosed my dishwasher of having a bad pump, when they took the dishwasher apart they said the water pump was not broken but they put a new one in anyway😳 that did not fix it!! then they told me that the pump fried the control panel I said okay about the control panel, water pump and control panel now I'm into it for $500 they replace the control panel that did not fix it😳 they tried one more thing they did not tell me what it was they replaced it for free that did not fix it I told him I wanted my money back this has been such a joke, and a huge waste of my time!!!I finally got all of my money back so I went through all this trouble and my dishwasher is the same as it was before I started these people don't know what they're doing they were looking up on YouTube how to fix it while they were at my house I would suggest nobody call these people"
1,I had thought this was like a professional/commercial type of business but I guess it's more of a local handy mans personal business.  In the first 5 minutes of him arriving he had told me that I needed to replace the whole control board before even really touching the machine. So I was getting ready to pay him for his assessment so he could be on his way and I could just go find someone else to do the job. But then he tells me he wants to make sure and spends another hour and 15 minutes going inside the washer and then comes up with the same need to replace the control board. It seemed like he needed to watch some videos or talk to somebody else about it first. Then at the end says it will be 210$ to replace the control board plus parts.....idk if he wash just killing time down there to make the 70$assessment worth it or something. But I definitely will not be calling this company back. He was a kind man not rude or anything just didn't seem like he knew what was going on and just wanted me to choose the most expensive option when we are pretty sure that's not the problem. Pretty disappointed
5,Dimitri was very good. No problems. Took the time to explain answers when I asked questions.

1,The reason I leave a 1 star rating is the diagnostic they provide did not solve the problem. They did not spend time to reply or correct their wrong diagnostics. The issue was dishwasher not cleaning properly the dishes. They said the garbage disposal is problem your dishwasher is perfectly fine. I changed the garbage disposal but still the same issue continues. So their diagnostic was wrong. If there were a different root cause they did not spend time or effort to check. I could use my money more wisely rather then employing this team.

4,Got my fridge up and running in about an hour. It was worth the overnight wait to get it done.
2,"They were very responsive at the start, but then would not allow me to talk to the actual technician after the initial assessment. They had me pay via Venmo which was very sketchy and then couldn't schedule the work until a week later after ordering the part. Then, less than 12 hours before the appointment, they texted me to say the technician wouldn't be available and asked if I could reschedule for 8 hours later. I refused because this was for a rental and my tenants already made arrangements with their work, and the technician showed up at the time originally discussed. Once the work was done, while I was in a work meeting, I received 2 phone calls and a text message asking for payment. The most responsive they were was for my initial call and for their payment. I would not use this company again due to the lack of professionalism and refusal to allow me to talk to the technician and then paying via a Venmo account."
