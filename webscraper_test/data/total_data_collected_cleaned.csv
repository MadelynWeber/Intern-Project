5,Fantastic The two people who came really worked hardscrub bathroom tile floor tons of dusting and cleaning from top to bottom
5,This was my first general cleaning after my deep cleaning last month I am very happy with the quality of work performed A great job I will be setting up future monthly cleaning with CH
5,Al and his crew do an outstanding job We have used them for both housecleaning and handyman services Highly recommend They have done a springdeep cleaning which made the house look sparkly clean again as well well as bi weekly cleaning to keep it maintained In additon we needed two doors replaced and they were able to handle this in just a few hours and at a reasonable price
5,When I moved into my house I was disappointed in the condition it was in I had Al come and provide a estimate to get it cleaned properly I was very happy with the work performed Everything that was cleaned sparkled when it was completed The quality was better than I expected The cleaning crew was friendly Al came and made sure that all the cleaning we had agreed to was completed Will be scheduling a regular cleaning service with the company
5,C  H replied to my request on Angies List online within minutes An appointment was scheduled the very next day to give an estimate The work was completed the day after the estimate within 4 hours They were on time for both appointments They were also mindful on saving money wherever possible The screen on the crawl space was an urgent need to keep out unwanted pests and they got it fixed fast Very professional and friendly Thanks C  H

5,CH cleaning is a great cleaning company  They did cleaning both my house and office they have went through all details needed to be cleaned There work shows how professional they are I asked for additional areas to be done and they were happy to do so I am very comfortable with this company to work with I have requested them to clean my house byweekly and office weekly Very happy and satisfied customer that would love to recomed them to anyone is need for cleaning
5,Fabulous Best cleaning crew Ive ever had
5,It went great Al and one of his handymen arrived on time completed the job quickly cleaned up after the work and then helped my neighbor with a job he needed done They split the cost between the two of us which was very nice They have a two hour minimum and each job took less than half an hour But it was worth it to each of us to have the jobs done and done well My kitchen is nice and bright now I would definitely hire Al and his crew again The cost shown below is my half of the bill
1,Terrible I got a quote of 220240 It cost 280 Thats not the worst I had the walls repainted and the windows done so those did not need to be done during this cleaning I cleaned out the refrigerator myself This house is a 1100 sq foot house with 3 small bedrooms and 2 small baths  a kitchen living room 3 bedrooms  living room have wood floors All they had to do in those rooms is clean the wood floors and wipe down the blinds The one bathroom had a shower the other a tub Shouldnt take more than l2 hours to clean both I had precleaned the stove so all it needed was wiped out When I saw the house after 10 hrs 2 people 5 hours each I couldnt believe how much they didnt do I discussed how unhappy I was with the person who I guess is their supervisor and he started telling me I was wrong so I told them to get out I spent the next two hours redoing all the wood floors cleaned the bathrooms again and cleaned the tile floors in the kitchen and hallway I have picture of the amount of dirt I got off these floors They must have been either talking on their cellphones the whole time and talking among themselves because they certainly didnt clean the house I would never want anyone to hire them I only included two pictures of the 8 I took of the dirt left on the floor I also cleaned behind the refrigerator which they didnt
5,Excellent work performed complete with painting and clean up
5,Since we have been using C  H we couldnt be more happy with our monthly cleaning service Al has been wonderful and attentive to details time communication and overall professionalism since day one The cleaners that he has sent to our home have continued to show outstanding performance and weve been very happy with the results and cleanliness after each visit If there is ever a concern Al always takes the time to address the issue and make changes as needed I highly recommend using C  H for your house cleaning services we were lucky to have found them
5,All went well Al is very professional and super responsive He is willing to work until everything is perfect Will definitely hire again
5,We utilized CH for several handyman projects in a recently purchased condo as well as a full cleaning in advance of move in The handyman project including replacing the door moulding and putting new thresholds and weather stripping on the doors Well done The cleaning was done well with particularly work well done in the kitchen area to include dishwasher oven stove top and all cupboards and sink The owner of the company Al is a highly customer centric individual whom only wants the customer to be well served and completely satisfied in the project results He met me in advance of the projects and totally understood the work to be done He was early for the four times we met his crew was on time he gets his hands dirty he is a problem solver and he is there for the end of the job for final inspection He is a man of high integrity I recommend CH for any handyman or cleaning needs you may have Start with Al
5,After a disappointing job by Molly Maids I hired CH to do the job right Rosa worked her magic and the place sparkles Al was very responsive when we were setting up the appt and he arrived with Rosa to go over what needed to be done He also came back at completion and rolled up his sleeves and helped sweep out the garage Many thanks for your hard work
1,I am not impressed The cleaners did not wipe away the dust around the fireplace or move a small fridge to clean the hardwood floor underneath The house was completely empty and we were told the job would last 67 hours When my husband returned home at 6 hours he found the cleaners sitting in the car When I swiped a finger inside the bathroom drawers they came back dirty Clearly they had not been cleaned or if they had it was not done with a note for detail So after spending 420 to have the place professionally cleaned I will have to take off of work prior to moving in to clean myself Completely unacceptable Clearly this was an overpriced superficial clean
5,There were three workers for about 5 hours at a cost of 630 They worked non stop and were able to remove a rust stain on the tile in the shower years of dirt on a heat lamp in the ceiling and many other feats due to negligence The owner arrived with the team and checked back at noon and at the end of their time always checking their work and making sure they were taking care of the specific things I had requested It was a great experience and I will now be using them twice a month
5,CH Cleaning  Handyman Services Formally Cristina and Jareds Cleaning I have used C  H Cleaning and Handyman Services for about a year and a half I highly recommend their services Originally I hired them to clean my house before a party While they were at it I had them fix some things around the house They did such a good job I hired them to clean my mothers house for an event and then I gave my daughter a clean house as a Birthday present using their services Currently they come every two weeks to clean my house and they do a very great job Usually I have the same person all of the time she is very through and efficient She helps do special little projects like cleaning and organizing a closet On occasion when the regular person could not come Al the owner comes with the replacement to make sure that they know what I like They also bring their own cleaning supplies They use something better than BONO on my wood floors I found they also steam carpets  so I had them steam clean an area rug that was filthy and had really thick pile It looks great now
5,I had 3 cleaners here for an entire day The house sparkled when they were done The cleaners checked with me a few times during the day as they finished areas to make sure that I was pleased and they followed up on any areas that I pointed out to them After the house cleaning they cleaned the carpets in the main traffic areas of the house and the master bedroom The carpets looked great and it was so convenient to have everything done at the same time The cleaners worked really hard and Al checked with me at the end of the day to make sure everything was done to my satisfaction
5,incredibly easy affordable and did great work
5,Everything went perfectly The owner and his employee I believe her name was RosaI apologize I have an awful memory for names arrived promptly at the appt time I had 1 worker for 4 hours They asked me what my priorities were which I told them were bathroom then kitchen then living areas I have a bad knee and cannot kneel on the floor to scrub tub or floors Bathroom sparkled when finished Kitchen cabinets were wiped down as I requested baseboards cleaned floors cleaned All wooden blinds dusted as well as furniture and carpets vaccumed I was completely happy and satisfied with the work that was done
5,I just wanted to let you know that we are very pleased with our cleaning today by Rosa I have tried three other services before Two of them were flakes and either did not show up or called in sick at the last minute both times we were expecting company and we didnt have a clean house Also one of the cleaners broke an item and didnt even tell us I discovered it later The last one came twice with a team of SIX Both times I had to have them come back to clean things they missed or didnt do well Not only did Rosa do a better job than the previous cleaners but a better job than TEAMS of cleaners She is also very polite and respectful Thank you Rosa we will be setting up a regular cleaning each month with you
5,We have hired them for regular cleaning
5,The place sparkled The cabinetsout and especially insidelooked like new All they wanted to know from me was whether there was anything more they could do anything they had overlooked What could I say Im a perfectionist but their work was beyond perfect In fact my general contractor who oversaw the multiday work was so impressed with the cleaning company and the owner that he is going to regularly use them on projects he does When one professional like the work of another one that much that is a terrific recommendation
5,Al called me back at 6 pm at night just to schedule He was wonderful to work with My tenants gave me some issues with scheduling so we had to change a few times but he was so easy to work with and changed dates for me Dominique showed up on time so happy and full of energy She was very attentive and gave attention to detail We will be scheduling with them again Thank you
5,Several days before the cleaning appointment Abdul came to our apartment and did an assessment He carefully wrote detailed notes of what I specifically wanted done On the day of the cleaning Rosa arrived exactly on time She worked diligently on each task and did a great job making our apartment sparkle and shine I appreciate Rosas thorough work ethic her valuable experience in cleaning homes and her friendly personality Ill definitely refer this company to my friends and family members and schedule Rosa to clean our apartment on a regular basis
5,I spoke with Al on the phone to give him a scope of work needed He set an appointment to meet at the property to give me a quote which allowed me to show him specific work ahead of time We set an appointment for cleaning and the had two housekeepers clean the unit He also spent some time doing some of the work himself mainly shining and oiling the wood floors They did a wonderful job They did specific cleaning that the pending tenant requested When they were done but place just shined and smelled good too I would definitely use Als company again and HIGHLY recommend it
4,Three people plus the supervisor arrived about 12 hour late They were here for about 6 hours The service charges based on time spent per individual worker The supervisor Al comes and goes to check on the staff The quality of the cleaning was good and thorough The amount of time spent by the crew including lunch and breaks was probably somewhat longer than needed After reviewing the completed job areas that did not meet our requirements were recleaned to our satisfaction
5,I have used Kristina  Jareds Cleaning three times now to clean up my home before company arrived They have been very responsive and accommodating in my requests I work so my schedule is difficult Each of the three cleaners was cheerful and efficient Their work was very good After each cleaning I felt like someone gave me 4 hours of my life back since the rooms were beautifully clean and I could do my own work instead Worth the money
5,My husband and I have been using Kristina  Jareds Cleaning Service for about one year Rosa comes to clean our house every two weeks and we are extremely satisfied with the professional and high quality cleaning work performed by Rosa She is always punctual efficient hard working and pays meticulous attention to details Both Rosa  Al the owner are very friendly attentive flexible and reliable We very much value the trusting long term working relationship we have with Al  Rosa and will enthusiastically recommend Kristina  Jareds Cleaning Service to anyone in San Diego who needs house cleaning service
5,It went very well until I discovered they had taken 980 in cash from my money box I simply did not think about moving it as I had told them not to do anything with the cabinet on which I keep it I contacted the company and he interviewed the cleaners and even brought them to the house to show them where the money had been They denied having taken it and there was no way I could prove that the money had even been there The only way to resolve this is to take them to small claims court and that would again be just my word against theirs So  I WILL NOT be hiring them again18
5,The person arrived right on time She was friendly and polite She started right in and we left her alone we could hear her working away After 4 hrs she had finished exactly what we had agreed to The floors and counters were really clean We had no complaints We contacted Al to repeat the service again this month
4,Very slow It took her 212 hour for the master bath only Then forgot to clean a glass shelf
5,Friendly professional team that I will invite back help me deep clean the parts of my condo that are hard for me
5,The servicer was polite and on time The cleaner was thorough and very friendly Excellent Job
5,they showed up with 4 men and really turned to great job the moved and cleaned under and around every thing window tracks etc great job
4,OK  could have made somewhat more progress in the hours allotted
5,I originally purchased the deal for 1 person for 4hrs but after talking with AL I decided to pay for a second person to help Maria and Rosa did a great job I enjoyed having them in my home The tile floors and baseboards thru out the entire condo that were so filthy in the beginning looked great after these ladies were finished
5,If you want a clean house with people who are consistent and responsible this is the company for you They may cost more but they are more than worth it Al is great and Rosa is awesome
5,Wonderful company to work with Al is very nice and communicative I was very happy with their attention to detail
5,Al and his team of three cleaners arrived right on time We walked through the rooms theyd be cleaning and discussed particular areas of concern in each oven fridge hard water stains on faucets etc Al also explained that this was a new crew so they might not be the fastest but he promised theyd be thorough Sure enough they were Maria Gina and Leroy did a phenomenal job  everything was sparkling clean when they left They also did some extra things like vacuuming and sweeping the main living room right before they left and Leroy took out a bunch of trash that wed piled up as we were packing  it wasnt even their cleaning trash The last thing of note was that Maria saw one of my earrings as she was loading their vacuum into their car She rescued it from the vacuum canister and rushed back to hand it to me I really cant say enough good things about this experience  the team was helpful honest thoughtful thorough and friendly I would use Kristina and Jareds again and I would recommend them to anyone
5,Rosa got here on time when they said someone would be here She asked me what I wanted done in the 4 hrs she would be here I told her the important things that I wanted done and she did them professionally and great service
5,These guys did an impeccable job both times Ive hired them In the ten years that Ive hired cleaners not one has done as detailed a cleaning job as these guys The owner is great highly communicative and cares deeply about customer satisfaction and quality work by his team After these two one time jobs I am definitely going to sign them up for regular cleanings These guys do a lot of the things that other cleaners cut corners on  things like not dusting baseboardsdoorframes leaving small boxes unmoved where things could be easily cleaned rugs closets etc  but these guys take care of everything the first time every time Really impressed
5,Superbly I am pleased with the professionalism of Kristina and Jareds Cleaning Service and the outstanding service provided
4,They did ok It wasnt a perfect job but it was a great relief It had gotten pretty bad around here We had no cause or an real complaint The floors were real streaky when they got through It could have used another clear rinse We are not complaining really Price was reasonable It seemed appropriate They were on time as much as you could be on time considering the freeway He works for somebody else
5,I have been with KJ Cleaning Service since its inception when it was formerly Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Services After a somewhat rocky start when it was starting up I am particularly pleased with the work of Vincent one of the workers and Al the proprietormanager Vince provides that extra something that is vital in home care and does it pleasantly and with apparent joy
2,Date of service was postponed several times by agency and when finally somebody came to clean the house did not do a good job Very light cleaning didnt dust didnt washed dishes bathroom tubs were left with a black circle around the drain and other basic cleaning things were missed
3,I have an 1800 sq foot house I live alone My house is clean  neat I wanted a general cleaning They asked me what was most important to me because they could not clean my whole house in the 4 hr window I said the bathrooms family room kitchen were most important They said they could not do all that in the four hours So I said the most important things to me was the bathrooms  didnt want them to leave without doing the floors And that is all they did in 4 hours the bathrooms  floors The bathrooms include a powder room used only for guests  is neat  clean the master bath which is not moldy or dirty no soap scum build up in shower or on the shower door  the hall bath used when I have company stay Then they vacuumed the carpet  washed the kitchen floor  tile floor in the entry  dining area What they did was excellent They paid attention to detail But Ive had house cleaners many many times over the years so I know what cleaners do in a 4 hour period of time as well as what I can do I was going to check them out to see if I would want them on a regular basis i was not happy with what they were able to accomplish in that time I told the gentleman that He said they dont just go in  wipe up They do the job to really get things clean I will say what they did was good work just very slow i would not hire them again
5,They did a fantastic job Even my mother was impressed
4,They were very thorough and the 4 hrs I booked were not enough time for the detailed cleaning they did What was done was great
5,The cleaning of the bathrooms far exceeded my expectations They were much much cleaner than I had ever managed on my own The wood floors look great too I highly recommend the service
3,The first time was good but the second and third were fair Im going to end up going with someone else Im sad that the business was sold and is now being run by someone else The first person that came out was with the original owners and the last two times where with the new people I really wish they would charge by the hour because my house doesnt need 4 hours worth of cleaning Try them for yourself but Im being cautious
5,Ultimately it went well The housekeeper arrived right on time and worked very hard to get my house clean in the time allotted The company was ultimately very professional The Saturday before my Monday morning cleaning they called to cancel my service as their cleaner had become unavailable I politely asked for a refund as I needed the service done that day in advance of arriving guests and my request was going to be granted They then called back within the hour to say that theyd found another housekeeper to perform the service I really appreciate that they ultimately honored the appointment Wish we hadnt had to go through the stress of the cancellation first though
5,They did a very thorough job The cleaners were on time friendly and did exactly what I asked them to After letting my previous house cleaning service lapse a year ago I will be sticking with Kristina and Jareds
3,It was just ok We live in a small condo so 4 hours of work should be plenty of time to clean I had two small requests time permitting to sweep the leaves off the back porch and to fold the clothes I took out of the dryer the night before I tipped quite well because im aware that this isnt what they normally do They did do the things but thet left me a snarky note about it so I decided I would not be using them again
5,They did great work and never stopped moving Very pleasant very professional
5,very well will rehire for further services
5,He was professional delightful and thoughtful His only issue was getting stuck in traffic and being late He stayed until the job was done As I need more help around the house I will ask for Al again Thank you I will be requesting cleaning services soon
5,Al is very reasonable and flexible with schedule fee and payment options Rosa has done a wonderful job making our home look beautiful and sparkling every time she visits I would recommend this company and service to any one
5,Al and his entire team were great James Rosa G and Yanette worked very hard for two plus days scrubbing kitchen surfaces inside large oven vent hoods bathrooms floors and other surfaces until everything was clean They were very polite and helpful with many extra requests Al and James even moved furniture from one room to another when asked Al also made minor repairs He recaulked one of my shower stalls and replaced hard to reach light bulbs throughout the house I liked these folks so much that I hired them to clean my house on a bimonthly basis I highly recommend Al and his team to anyone looking for a polite dependable and hard working household cleaning firm
5,Fabulously My house was tidy but not sparkling clean After these professionals got through with it it looked terrific Wow What a wonderful feeling to come home from work and see what they had done
2,Was to arrive by 1 came at 130 was to be 2 people for 3 bedroom 3 bath but only 1 and they did not leave for 7 hours I have had dual maids and they cleaned more thoroughly in 4 hours I missed appointments and I was hungry from missing two meals and exhausted trying to find where to be to not be underfoot Jared came and put together a bike but barely cleaned and brusquely told me they are strictly a move in move out business That they do not wash anything and with him trying to clean I had to ask it constantly point out what needed cleaning but after the confrontation I cleaned alongside them despite recuperating from hospital The one maid is pleasant but cleans with a lot of crashing noise but is through Jared should never clean if it gets past time to arrive he should have rescheduled Not that that helps me since he made it clear their company is not as if hiring a maid to clean house tho they are called housecleaners
5,It was great Al and Rosa had my old address my fault but they showed up and were so pleasant and hard working Rosa is amazing I am so thankful
5,The 2 ladies came on time and stayed over to finish an extra task that I had requested
5,The group of 3 showed up on time and did a good job cleaning our 2br condo I had wanted to clean the counter tops tiles with grouts and cook top thoroughly and they did a great job The cabinets and drawers were not cleaned but they were honest up front about how much can be done with the 4hour special
5,Dominique was incredible She was prompt efficient and made my house look perfect just in time for company to come over
5,Al called me back on Christmas day and came out the next day with a 3person crew They got it all done in one day cleaning construction dust from every nook and cranny They did a beautiful job with deep cleaning basically everywhere working nonstop and actually saving the hardwood floor They were extremely professional and showed up on time It was a Christmas miracle I would recommend them
3,The kitchen was cleaned except baseboards as he used steam cleaner for the floor and did not wash the front of the cabinets Bathrooms were cleaned except the baseboards and around the toilet and that floor area I had to ask him to clean the area behind the toilet area which he did in the front bathroom Unfortunately I had to run an errand and left my husband in charge of checking the final rooms
5,James was right on time and did a fantastic job The place looks brand new He was polite and a gentleman I would hire this company again with James in a heartbeat James did a wonderful way above average job
5,Amazing Very nice and professional
3,One person arrived worked for 4 hours She was personable and pleasant Cleaned obvious areas did not move trash containers smaller items or dining room chairs to clean under or behind on the floor Dusted around items on furniture not moving things to dust under My highrisk pregnancy daughter was cleaning the next day when I arrived to decorate  moving chairs to dustmop under the dining room table cleaning under and behind trash containers and several small pieces on the floor redusting shelves and table tops Interestingly Im filing this review WITHOUT you promptly asking for it  makes me now question if I should use your evaluations of services as accurate Carol Parham
5,wonderful experience highly recommend if your looking for an efficient cleaning service Above and beyond expectations Thank you to Jared Al and Dominique
5,They were very punctual and clean and courteous and explained the installation Worked very hard and got the job done with an excellent product We installed 2 windows
5,Jared was very professional and did a great job He goes above and beyond just fixing items hell also clean them up and leave everything sparkling new

5,Excellent A lot of deferred work completed on time and in budget Very professional
5,Ryan came to our home to clean our house and did an excellent job He was punctual and very efficient cleaning everything Thank you Michael and Linda Neylan
5,Excellent  beyond my expectations
5,The best cleaners in my experience We have had many cleaning services and private cleaners We wont be changing Thanks Pablo and Maria
5,Very well We have had excellent results using the service for three years now The cost is a good value and varies depending on the amount of work we have done We tell them the big items we want done and they send the right number of people to do the job in a reasonable time They work inside and outside and take on any cleaning job we have given them We found them on Angies List and are glad we did
5,Excellent Cannot say enough good things about the services provided
5,Excellent service by Jared and James They showed up exactly on time and quickly determined what was wanted They performed a deep cleaning on our home including our windows The windows are especially difficult because each is double pained and twice the amount of sections compared to standard windows The house had not had a thorough cleaning in some time and they completely brought it up to speed Their attitudes were pleasant and comforting We will continue to use this service on a regular basis The experience exceeded our expectations
5,I have had incredible service from Pablo and Maria They are such wonderful people and take such great care of our home We have had them cleaning our house for over 2 years now and they have become like our family It is such a great feeling to come home to a clean home and Pablo and Maria work miracles on our house they even go above our expectation by clearing out slow draining sink drains and changing out our toilet seat when we bought a new one without even being asked it is such a pleasant surprise they anticipate our needs We have two little girls and we both work full time so our house can get a bit chaotic it is great to have people we can trust they help us maintain our sanity Thank you so much we appreciate everything you do
3,Not well They were supposed to be at my house at 1030 am At 1045 am they called to say they would be late and were just leaving Poway at that time I live in East County so I knew there might be a delay I would have appreciated a call sooner than 1045 At 1220 pm they called again to say they were on the way from El Cajon At 140 pm I decided I had waited long enough and I knew the job would not be done in time for me to move on to other commitments later in the day
5,FANTASTIC I was utterly shocked with how amazing my place looked after the cleaning It was far beyond my expectations Kristina and Jared cleaned places I did not even think about They went so far as to use magic erasers on the walls and polish the hardwood floors The whole place sparkled Jared came back for a second time to finish the cleaning and because they did not have the proper amount of time to finish the job he came back for a third time free of charge to ensure my place was up to par Kristina  Jared run an honest good company and I will definitely be having them back to clean again Thank you Kristina and Jared
5,Jared is a real professional Our home was cleaned perfect He took the time to know exactly what I wanted done Its rare to find real professionals in this industry
5,After health problems repairs and an overly busy work schedule the house was in serious need of cleaning I also needed to limit the time to four hours due to costs Ryans focus was set for the kitchen 2 bathrooms floors and dusting as time would allow My mind is much more at ease now that the house is clean Ryan was efficient thorough and friendly He is an excellent representative for Kristina  Jareds Cleaning  Handyman Service My husband and I will be discussing having Ryan provide a regular cleaning service for us moving forward as our finances allow
5,Jared and his assistant did a wonderful job Everything looks better than we thought it would He did an excellent job on the wood cabinets Tile shines Grout is white again We plan on using his service again in the next month We highly recommend him
5,Both Jered and Kristina were wonderful They both were friendly and very professional a well as extremely hard workers They did a wonderful job and we are so happy too have found them Highly recommended
5,Kristina and Jared are the number 1 housekeeping service that I have ever used in my 30 years of services They go beyond what is expected and are consistent each week In addition the team is so service oriented they do not hesitate to do the little things that I generally never notice I will continue to use them until they retire Hopefully not soon 
5,Jared and his team are punctual efficient and detailoriented They complete all work as expected I would recommend them to others
5,Showed up on time very important and they are very thorough In addition to housecleaning I have also asked Jared to perform some handyman type chores and he has accomplished those easily Nice to kill two birds with one stone
5,Jared and his crew are friendly professional and do a great job cleaning my home on a biweekly basis And they accommodate any special requests I have several cats so in addition to having lots of fur to clean up I insist on being home for any services provided As I work full time timing was a problem I really appreciate that Jared was able to accommodate my late afternoon request I would definitely recommend them
5,Dominique was right on time cheerful and pleasant She did all the specific tasks I asked her to including cleaning the windows inside out scrubbing a bathroom curtain and dusting the ceiling fans I just wish she had been more detailed in the kitchen and living room cleanup Some appliances and lamps were cleaned outside but not inside and some were forgotten But overall a good job in 5 hours
5,Excellent job This was my first time using Jareds service Quick responses to enquiries Arrived on time for the job which was performed quickly and efficiently Cleaned dirt out of areas I knew was there but frankly I hadnt expected to be noticedcleaned After this initial job with great results I have now scheduled him on a regular basis
4,I used this service for several months The cleaning was average The price flucutaed as well as the crew that arrived biweekly
5,Ive been with Jared and Kristinas for about a year now and have been extremely happy with their service I get regular cleaning every two weeks and have been impressed with the level of professionalism and the attention to detail that they provide On occasions that Ive made special requests or had any questions or concerns they have been extremely quick to respond and been accommodating They manage their business and customer service at a high level I searched a long time for cleaning service that cleans to my level of clean and that I can trust to be in my house Ive found both with Jared and Kristina highly recommended
2,According to the listing the cleaner is supposed to know how to clean all kinds of surfaces using their own supplies that are ecologically friendly When I contacted the lister I described the house including all of the surfaces to be cleaned ie stone bamboo and rugs Ray was very nice and very punctual But it was very awkward since Ray kept asking me what cleaning supplies to use Huh Ray cleaned the entire house very quickly Unfortunately the corners baseboards etc werent cleanned I didnt want to review this service because I could not give it a good review and feel bad about that  but the folks at Angies List keep sending me emails to do so So here goes The reason I am giving this service a D is because Ray thought he was helping by moving the furniture so he could clean under it He gouged the bamboo floors badly A house cleaner should have the motto First do no damage Very nice people but not a very professional job
5,It was a little more expensive than I thought it was going to be based on the deal listed for 4 hours They were here way longer than 4 hours but I assumed the deal would still stand They did a good job on the areas they did clean but I had pointed out a few areas and those were not completed However they did a great job on things I hadnt pointed out but did need to be cleaned They were very nice and very professional
5,We had used Kristina and Jared before and were quite pleased with the outcome We needed a pretty deep cleaning of our rental units garage some mold around a water heater Jarred was very accommodating with getting it done on my schedule and did another outstanding job Based on his professionalism and punctuality I would recommend them to all my friends and colleagues
4,Jared reached out to me to follow up on the services provided
5,I was present while the work was done and the team worked carefully and hard they were great Two and a half kitchens Four bathrooms Five bedrooms Two great rooms open floor plan Four ceiling fans 28 windows Hardwood tile and carpeted floors Everything went great In addition to the cleaning work mentioned Jared is also an handy man Two extra charge items not in the price above that he did this time were 1 Seal the granite counter tops in all three kitchens which needs to be done every 18 months to protect them 2 The front door on one unit is Cherry wood and had weathered in the sun from the southern exposure He refinished the outside of the door and it looks great
5,Cleaner was a few minutes early and cleaned the house in record time3Bed3Bath 2 story in just over 4 hours
5,The first time we used them we were moving out of an apartment we were renting while our home was being remodeled They stuck to their quoted price even though the job was a little more than they expected We then had them continue to clean our new home They were very reasonable and professional again sticking to their quoted pricing even though we were still in the middle of construction while living in our home and there was constant construction dust in our home I recommend Kristina and Jarods cleaning service
5,Jared has an excellent team He and his partners are always on time professional and my house sparkles when theyre finished cleaning I have 2 young children with nap schedules that must be worked around Jared is always easy to get a hold of and flexible I dont normally take time to write reviews but I feel the need to write a review on Kristina and Jareds outstanding service Yesterday Jared noticed that my shower was developing some nasty black mold Not only did he clean the shower but he also RECAULKED completely FREE OF CHARGE Ive never had a cleaning service go so far above expectations Thanks Jared and team I will now use Kristina and Jared for cleaning services and handyman services
5,We couldnt be happier with the result in every way Very clean totally dust free and love the cleaning products as it left such a pleasant smell not the least bit chemical smelling or flowery perfume just really pleasant not overwhelming We cant say enough good things about this service
5,Jared did an outstanding perfect job as always Floors looked wonderful as well as everything else He is very sensitive to the environment and especially used products that did not irritate an ill family member during a long illness He could not be more helpful kind and flexible Everything is done with very high standards of excellence
2,While the actual work done by the provider was initially more than satisfactory there are some details that force me to write a negative review The man who did the cleaning arrived quite late because he had been given the wrong street name by the company Apparently this forced him to rush through the cleaning in order to make his next scheduled appointment on time He did an excellent job of cleaning my home but he damaged a piece of furniture I called the company the next day and then emailed photos of the damage I got no initial response but two weeks later after I emailed the company again the owner responded He came today to repair the damage and clean my house but challenged me about the damage to my furniture claiming that it couldnt have been done by his employee Having been accused essentially of lying about it I told him that if he was going to question my honesty we were done At this he walked out refusing to make good on his employees carelessness When I told him that I would be posting this review he said he would have it buried within a week Dont hire this dishonest company
5,Pablo and Maria come every 2 weeks and we love it when they do The house is so clean after they come They arrive exactly when they say they will They bring all their tools and cleaners and special tricks with them In 24 hours the 2 of them work so hard and clean the house so well it sparkles when they are done Pablo and Maria are a great team and they are very pleasant while they are here They speak great English and Spanish so communication is never a problem in either language We have a dog which can be a little annoying at times but they manage him and clean around him while they work He treats them like family now when they arrive Anything extra we ask them to do they are happy to do it They even clean windows 1 a week to keep them looking good Maria makes the bed very beautifully so the night after they come is like going to bed in a resort They also change sheets on any bed we leave sheets for Jared is also very good to work with taking creditdebit card over the phone and rescheduling if needed Jared and Kristina are good business owners and very customer focused We cant say enough good about them Just hire them
5,We live in a large home with multiple living spaces and have been using Jareds cleaning service for several months Our main goto person is Ashley and she has been great She is very efficient and our house is always superclean after she is done She is also a great communicator and always gets in touch and communicates any schedule or other changes related to the cleaning in advance We really like working with her and plan to continue using their service on a regular basis
5,They did an excellent job I was very happy with the team that came out and the work done by all of them Their pricing is very fair and I plan on using them on a regular basis
5,Dominique does a terrific job Bathrooms and kitchen sparkle and the rest of my place is dust  dirt free When I request a change she is always willing to work with me I couldnt be more pleased Shes usually on time and if she is going to be delayed she always calls and lets me know She is a jewel
5,This is my third time using their service Ray is great My house isnt a disaster but he makes everything sparkle My faucets are shiny Stains left by a contractor when installing two sinks were removed by him today Im happy I am happy not to have to clean the hardwood floors anymore The owners are very responsive and the price is fair
5,Arrived on time brought all needed supplies including a steam mop for tile floors which really was different from any other cleaning service I have hired before It made the house feel alot cleaner also got cobwebs from high places went above and beyond what one just sees Monique was excellent
5,AMAZING I was TOTALLY stressing my home going on the market and having a bunch of handyman things to get done and Krisitna and Jareds Service came to my RESCUE they sent over Ray who seriously knocked it out of the park I had several challenging projects and Ray took care of all of them and did a great job This company is the REAL DEAL  professional very prompt to respond and do QUALITY work Very satisfied and WILL DEFINATELY use again
5,From my initial phone call with Jared to the actual housecleaning service this company has far excelled over the other housecleaning services I have usedat all levels After indepth research on Angies List on a Sunday I left a message on this companys voice mail asking them to contact me To my surprise within an hour Jared returned my call During my conversation with him I explained what had not worked for me with the other two companies I have used in the four years I have lived in San Diego I felt confident to give this company a try and Jared set an appointment for me for the following Thursday with Ray When Ray arrived precisely on time that day we went over what was most important to me and he set to work When he was done he showed me the results of his labors and I couldnt have been more pleased Literally the bathrooms kitchen and hardwood floors sparkled Nothing was missed from baseboards and casings to cabinetry and doors He is very polite professional and takes pride in his work I am now booked for the rest of the year
5,I am extraordinarily pleased with the care put into the cleaning  it was not slapdash The old kitchen and bathrooms sparkle I am completely satisfied The price was less than I expected Everyone I met was pleasant friendly and competent  no whining no judgements
5,Excellent service from Ray He came early before 6a just to accommodate my schedule and got to work right away even though it was still dark outside The tile looks fabulous  better than it has ever looked and the garden wall is sparkling clean The company beat the estimate I was given by a competitor and the work was exceptional Ray is very personable and professional  I will definitely use this company again in the very near future within a week Looking forward to more great work from Ray Thank you
4,There were two people My interaction with them is always good They always show up when they say they will They were a little hard to get hold of a couple of times I think he uses his cell phone for his business and therefore it was kind of hard to reach him I dont think I would use them in future until I call them and remind them of some things that they missed If they resolve that then I would use them again
5,Once they arrived they got right down to business Did a very thorough cleaning of a house that really needed a deep clean There was lots of dog hair dirt  dust everywhere but that didnt deter them We went through the priorities at the beginning and within 5 minutes they were at it I do feel they are a little pricey but you definitely get what you pay for Other less costly services Ive used definitely didnt do as good a job with the cleaning These guys are much more detail oriented than other cleaners Ive used Will definitely use again
5,Deep cleaning was required before we started our everyotherweek service The deep cleaning was so thorough that many things that I didnt know could shine were shining when the deep cleaning was completed Pablo and Maria spent several hours with that deep cleaning and have been doing a great job ever since Both of us work outside of the home and we like peace of mind with anyone providing us service especially when working inside our home We have used other cleaning people in the past and often they seemed to be rushing  leaving lights on or some cleaning supplies behind etc With Pablo and Maria everything is always in nice order when we get home on cleaning day Jared who coowns the company has been very helpful with the few questions we had when we started up and was always available to take my calls
5,They showed up on time and got right to work and did a great job We will definitely use them again
5,I hired them through Angies List for housecleaning Its Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service Im happy with them The cost is 100 each time Only one cleaner comes to clean for about 4 hours
5,It took them a long time but that was because the job warranted That amount of time and the house was a complete mess I am so gratefull for them staying and cleaning as much as they did I cant wait for them to come back and finish the rest of my house I have been able to upkeep what they did and when they finish they will need to keep coming back as my home is just too big a job for me
5,So far we are very pleased with the job done by Jared Our bathtub and shower are the cleanest we have ever seen them He brings his own cleaning products which are all natural and they leave the house smelling very good However he respects our requests to use certain products on our new furniture in keeping with the manufacturers recommendations He seems knowledgeable about the best products for cleaning and recommended a better product for our hardwood floors We are very happy with Jareds work and plan to use his services regularly
5,My home had sat empty for 3 or 4 months at a time while I was taking care of my Mom back east for 5 years It was very dusty Needed a good cleaning I appreciate the fact that it was Jared that came and I would prolong an appt just to get him He knows what hes doing He had someone come and do the bathroom while he was here and she was very thorough The ONLY reason I only checked good under  quality  is because the grout on the bathroom floor sat too long to get it really white again It needs to be done more than once and not their fault I would recommend them to anyone and I already did to my son  daughterinlaw Price was reasonable and fair Look forward to future business with them
5,We were looking for long term house cleaners to come out on a regular basis These folks are too notch Excellent quality of service  Jared really does a fantastic job in getting the place clean Super nice and professional Deservedly the best rated cleaning service on Angies List
5,I contacted Jared with confidence after reading the business reviews on Angies list I called on a Sunday expecting to leave a voice message and instead I got Jared live He explained pricing and what to expect I scheduled my first appointment knowing I would not be home and left a family member in charge Ive yet to meet Jared only have spoken to him a few times and left a few task lists My confidence was well placed Jared and team have done an excellent job inside my home They are dependable efficient with their time and handle my home items with respect and care Jared charges a fair price and shows when hes suppose to and does what he says hell do My home has been well maintained but having a home cleaning service that reliably cleans floors window blinds ceiling fans bathrooms and kitchen floors and floor boards is a treat to myself In fact it is a gift to myself by giving me a real day off on the weekends I have become a regularly scheduled client and have my home cleaned twice a month It feels so good to enter a well cleaned home with results that last for 2 weeks Its just the break I needed And because Im staying with a professional service theres no concerns about the sister of a friend of a cousin cleaning and telling all my business Thanks Jared
5,I was extremely pleased with the service I received Jared and his crew were so thorough and professional I was surprised that they even cleaned the chandeliers replaced burned out bulbs cleaned sky lights areas and even vacuumed inside the refrigerator My house really needed cleaning because of 3 dogs and just having had hardwood floors installed The house smelled clean which is hard to accomplish with 3 dogs in the house I will be using their services on a regular basis for my housecleaning Their rates for regular service are very reasonable I would highly highly recommend Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service
5,It went very wellthe team Carlos Claudia and a third person cant remember his name were there on time and ready to go and the condo looked great when they were done We also added on some last minute requests and asked them to install a new 220 volt electrical outlet adapter to fit our new washerdryer unit and to recaulk the two full bathrooms for us They did all of this in under 6 hours but thats because it included a couple of trips to Home Depot to get the right parts They were very accommodating through the whole process and completed everything we asked them to do The deepcleaning was very thorough and very welldone We will definitely use this service again in the future
5,Carlos and team were early They worked efficiently did everything I asked cleaned inside and out the windows They know their work and just executed They were wonderful to work with
3,Found out theres a 100 minimum I just have a small studio rental apt Last time it was done for 455 tip  took 1 lady 15 hrs But Smiley Maids refused to repeat the offer wa 60 minimum 2 lady minimum 2 hr minimum
5,This is my second review of this company I continue to be very pleased with the quality of the work performed We have a dog and two cats They shed large amounts of hair on the carpet and furniture Jared gets all the hair vacuumed off the floors then vacuums the furniture and kitchen chairs I am amazed at the amount of hair he is able to pick up with his vacuum He also does a fantastic job cleaning bathrooms especially giving extra attention to the bathtubs and the tile We have a recently remodeled bathroom with a new bathtub that had cracked grout along the top edge It had already begun to grow mold and mildew Jared surprised me by caulking along the cracked grout lines and cleaning it up so it looked brand new again He did not charge me for the extra work Then he did the same thing in an older bathroom and again did not charge me for the extra labor The bathrooms look great and I am always so pleased with the quality of the work and the attention to detail I will continue to use Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service bimonthly Jared is professional personable and serious about his work I am very happy with this company and highly recommend them
5,We have had a lot of construction going on including drywall so we needed a super cleaning with all of the drywall dust For our first cleaning Jared sent out a man  woman team That was a disaster but Jared cares deeply about keeping a stellar reputation so he personally came out with another man the following week to make things right Jared says that the former team are no longer with his company I was pleased with Jareds professionalism
5,Jared was very pleasant during the entire phone interview and scheduling He thought wed be very pleased with Maria and Pablo and we were beyond pleased They are extremely kind and detail oriented 2100 sq ft home all tile floors tile bathrooms and laundry room and two dogs that never take a break from shedding  most people would have turned and ran but Maria and Pablo didnt even flinch We look forward to continuing this relationship with this company and Maria and Pablo
5,Daniel and Jennifer are a wonderful couple and they have done a great job at our place and my Moms There first trip to our home was about 2 weeks ago and on there first visit they did a thorough cleaning which took a bit longer 4 hours for our place and 2 hours for my moms We have dogs and live downtown so dusting is an ongoing problem at my house by the time they got done our place was shining and lovely also the cleaning items they use I think Method does not leave the house smelling like a chemical factory but instead has a nice clean almost floral aroma They came today to do a regular cleaning 2 hours and again my home smells and looks wonderful As I mentioned they are a great couple and they want to make sure you are happy with the service they provide They also do a great job at my moms who has Alzheimers and can sometimes be a challenge to be around They are both excellent with my mom and just smile and keep answering the same questions over and over again I would highly recommend them to any one looking for an excellent cleaning service
5,Jared and Kristina are fantastic They are extremely organized and are hard working My house is spotless thanks to them Not only do they do great work They are very personable and easy to work with and flexible if anything comes up I really look forward to the day they come each week
1,My husband and I tried scheduling consultations They finally returned our call after several attempts When they did schedule with us they never showed At first we figured they were busy The first returned call when finally called was an apology for not returning due to them being out of town with a wedding We get that life can get in the way Then he told us hed call us back to schedule Never heard from them We called left a message You know the rest I wasted so much time and energy on this I purposely signed up for Angies List to look for this service So disappointed
5,I contacted Kristina and Jareds cleaning service about a month ago I was very impressed with Jareds quick response and got a very good feeling talking to him on the phone He said they needed to do a deep cleaning the first time they came out I was a little put out because my home is cleaned on a regular basis and I did not feel that it needed this deep cleaning He gave me an estimate of 200 which would be 8 hours of cleaning I decided to proceed with this deep cleaning When Ashley arrived 10 minutes early she knew right away that my home would not take 8 hours to deep clean She got right to work and was done in 5 hours The company adjusted my estimate accordingly no questions asked The second time Jennifer and Daniel cleaned my home Once again they came in started work and were very polite Asking questions on what I wanted done They left telling me to make sure I let them know what they may have not done and any requests that I may have for next time I am now scheduled to have my home cleaned biweekly
5,This is the best cleaning service I have had They were prompt had the expertise to see what needed cleaning and were 100 customer service oriented I asked about adding the outdoor kitchen and patio area on the first cleaning because we were planning on entertaining Jared the owner and another employee cleaned the area immediately at no cost Pablo and Maria are my regular cleaners and do a fantastic job with concern about my satisfaction I give them my highest recommendation which is not typical for me I can be a little difficult to please They are the best
5,Jared came by the property and gave me an estimate  we needed a thorough cleaning of the entire house They were on time flexible with instructions and very customer service oriented At one point there was a crew of 6 working at the same time but they got the job done as well as a few unplanned handyman repairs that came up This company goes above and beyond expectations  I dont need to look anywhere else No wonder they were voted Contractor of Year in their category in 2013 It wouldnt surprise me if they repeated it again for this year
5,Pablo and Maria were punctual and very thorough The condo is small but had not been completely cleaned for a while After they were done it looked so different They really cleaned the kitchen bathroom the blinds and the fans The wood floor in the bedroom looked much better after Maria got done with it They completely cleaned an oven that had become quite dirty Pablo redid the caulking around the bathtub It looks great now I plan to use them again to keep the place looking good
5,Pablo and Maria were on time and did a great job Cleaned home top to bottom in 6 hours I have 3 flooring types and granite counter tops House was bright and clean when they finished Very happy with the results and with Pablo and Maria Jared returned my initial call within 12 hours and explained the process pricing and scheduling in detail Will use this company again
5,Kiki and Ashley can me and spent 3 12 hours working with me to deep clean my condo I have not seen my bathroom and kitchen look this good in years They were professional friendly and polite They were very responsive to my requests and checked with me along the way to make sur I was happy with the service
5,contacted Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service as my first cleaning service to ever use I received an immediate email back with the date available I wanted them to come out for Jerone Glass arrived several minutes early was professional kind and funny I showed him around my small condo and he got right to work I left him there several times to run errands It was their first visit so he took his time I asked him if he could wash the windows I have two  sometimes 3dogs and they ruin my windows He not only did a great job on the condo the windows looked like I left them open I was so happy I had to go to work for a couple of hours and left him there to finish and came home to a lovely scented clean home I will definitely have this company return Big plus for me was Jerone and Jared were prior Active Duty Navy as am I Jared stayed in close contact with during the visit and was definitely concerned with my satisfaction I will definitely have them return for regular cleaning
5,It was a man and his wife that came They were on time and very thorough
5,Our family first used Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service last December The house was very dirty because it had been more than a year since it had been thoroughly cleaned by a cleaning service I asked for a deep cleaning and was told it would probably take 5 to 6 hours Two people came to clean and spent around 4 hours doing the cleaning After they left I realized they had missed some places that should have been cleaned and initially felt disappointed I called and talked to Jared about the problems He responded immediately by driving over to our house and inspecting the house He reassured me that he would take care of the next cleaning at no cost to me I was very impressed by his concern and immediate attention to my complaints We picked a weekend in January for our next cleaning Jared came and performed the cleaning himself and did a fabulous job The cleaning was very thorough and I was really impressed Jared is also very friendly and personable I told him I would like to continue having the housecleaning service every two weeks I am very happy to have Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service as my new permanent housecleaning service provider They are punctual professional and friendly I look forward to a long relationship with this company and know if I have any problems with their services they will always make it right because of their honesty and integrity
5,This is my second review for these guys and it is simply because I really like their service We switched about 5 months ago from another housekeeping company to Kristina and Jared and immediately we saw the difference We have had them since then on a biweekly schedule We have had different people coming to clean our house from Kristina and Jared but the last visit was done by Jared and Kiki and they really made a mark I have never seen such high professionalism when it comes to cleaning The house is super clean and fresh I am very glad we have found them as it is not easy to find a good housekeeping company who knows what clean really means Thank you guys
5,Am so incredibly impressed with Maria  Pablo They were punctual friendly professional and did an absolutely incredible job Wouldnt hesitate to recommend them and definitely plan on using them again Will make this a regular appointment
5,Great The cleaners are efficient professional and friendly They have been patient with my dogs family traffic and working with my schedule I have some residual haze from an old cleaner hubby using the wrong product on laminate wood flooring that is gradually going away with each cleaning They did a great job especially last week when I turned on the whole house fan after the Santa Ana winds thus sucking in all of the dust What a mess I made I have been using this service since April 2014 I feel comfortable with them in my home and that says a lot
5,Theyre very very thorough They cleaned everything and they have excellent attention to what they were doing They work hard and very diligent with what theyre doing so I think its a fair value of the money Theyre very meticulous very detailed and they get through everything I have one of these wooden knife holders sitting on the counter and they take every knife out and clean them individually
5,Its been about eight months that I have used Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service They visit about every two weeks I have been very pleased with their service and their devotion to detail I was surprised to see a negative review of their service becausefor menot only have they been personable but consistently have done an excellent job and are always open to suggestion and have needed to phoneonly oncewhen unforeseen events required a change in the arrival for a visit I would still award their service an A
5,Jared sent a couple who work for him Maria and her husband I intend to call them again Attention to my needs and did great job
3,I wish I knew It took me 23 days to even schedule them to come out and then they completely blew me off until I called multiple times with threats of writing bad reviews I took off the day of work to be home to have this taken care of so I was really put out If they really did have a car accident as stated a business should have a backup plan for allowing business as usual to continue despite setbacks Maybe inform your workers the day before instead of an hour before they are supposed to show up so that if emergencies occur its not a big deal Just a thought
5,It went very well I was very pleased with Pablo and Maria We had some ceiling repair work done so the whole house was very dusty Dont think my house has ever been this clean Just wanted to get back with further review Pablo and Maria came for the 3rd time today and I just love them If they are an example of all the crews that Kristina and Jered send out you need to check them out I have had many housekeeping services over the years and they take the cake There is not a way to give them an A but would if I could They are prompt and so professional They know how to really clean a home My family feel so comfortable with them in the house and I will have them come every week for a loooong time My puppy dog that normally will bark at a new man walking in the house welcomed him with open paws Thanks Kristina and Jered for making my life so wonderful When Pablo and Maria leave I know I have not thrown my  away
5,They are wonderful They are very flexible and are careful not to disturb my husband I really appreciate their exceptional service and would recommend their services to others
5,It went great Jared was completely trustworthy and extremely helpful when we were in a situation where we couldnt get to our home We knew our smoke detector alarms batteries were bad because we could hear the annoying beeping noise they make through our video alarm system We needed to find someone we could trust for emergency situations like this to help us out in a bind We talked to Jared and he immediately put us at ease and said hed be happy to help I was of course nervous giving a stranger a key to our home but it turns out Jared is now on our trust list We mailed him the key along with some batteries and he took care of our problem as soon as he got the mail He even called us when he was heading into our place as we requested We will definitely be doing business with Jared more in the future Maybe a paint job next We shall see but we will definitely continue building our relationship with Jared and Kristina I would absolutely recommend them Thanks Again
5,It was exactly what I was looking for
5,They were both very nice professional and listened to my requests I intend to use their services on an occasional basis and more regularly once I have a monthly budget
5,Theyre very thorough and willing to work with me on timing The prices are a little high but that might be because of the area I do think Im getting what I paid for
5,We have been using Kristina and Jareds cleaning service for about 89 months now Jared cleans for us twice a month and always does a wonderful job I have asked for a few extra items to be cleaned and some window screens installed Jared always cheerfully will help us out with our requests I trust Jared completely with my home and items He is very honest and trustworthy We love Kristina and Jared and will be keeping them for as long as they are available Bob and Trish Christiansen
5,Jared answered the phone personally listened carefully and understood the problem knew that he could not do the job and gave me a referral to someone he believes can do it This response and knowledge is valuable enough to me that I wanted to write a review
5,We recently hired Kristina and Jared to do a floortoceiling cleanup after having our home remodeled With plenty of dirt grime and sawdust everywhere and me being admittedly very picky about cleaning it wasnt an easy job Based on the list I gave them they decided to bring extra help and they worked away for at least half a dayfloors counters bathrooms windows carpetsI even asked them to clean the tracks of the sliding glass doors They did everything I asked efficiently enthusiastically and with a smile They went out of their way to make sure I was completely satisfied with the job When I had concerns about some streaks remaining on the windows they redid all the windows and glass doors When I asked about a film that seem to remain on the new flooring Jared explained to me that he believed this was normal and would take a few cleanings to dissipate Nonetheless he remopped the floors again for me just to be sure I was happy I think they mopped them at least three or four times Bottom line is great job great attitude nice people
5,Jamie and Chris came on time and worked for 5 hours and made our house very clean We just moved into this house and have had a lot of contractors in and out Also we were tired of the inconsistency of the quality of the work and the personnel the previous housekeepers we had had for 15 years who have received quite good reviews here After reading the reviews about Kristina and Jareds housekeeping services I contacted Jared and got todays cleaning They are very professional very courteous and did an excellent job I am very glad with the result and I am looking forward to the future services by them
5,They did it professionally and with a smile I would highly recommend their service and I plan to use them in the future
5,I needed their service to clean a rental unit Wonderful wonderful service The cleaning was perfect and they could not have been more courteous I will definitely use them again
5,Jamie  Jake showed up at the time requested and brought equipment  supplies They made sure to find out my priorities and my dos  donts They moved furniture and gave the area rug a good thorough vacuuming We have a dog  cat so this is extremely important I explained that the floors mostly wood  tile were my pet peeves if not done well Nothing looks clean if the floors are only half done Absolutely no complaints They even got the hard water stains off the granite in the bathroom Thorough professional and good humored an extra bonus the whole time Hoping to see them back very soon The dog is shedding profusely with all this warm weather
5,Very satisfied with their work and would recommend them highly
5,Outstanding work Came for the second time and we were very happy with the results My wife was skeptical at first but has been LOVING it Very reasonably priced We have a 32 1200sq ft home Both times he arrived promptly which is a big deal to me Kristina  Jared both followed up with me after the first visit and wanted to ensure that everything went smooth Well run business that takes pride in service
5,Let me preface by saying that I normally never write reviews but the service provided by Kristina and Jareds went above and beyond all my expectations They showed up on time and not only were they extremely thorough and reasonable in cost I have never seen a company that is that professional and personable at the same time They turned a townhome that looked like a disaster zone from renovations into a model home Jared and his crew were the most hardworking group of individuals I have met and Kristina is so personable and helpful I had to reschedule my original cleaning time and they were more than happy to accomodate my request Furthermore Jared even returned a couple days later to help me troubleshoot an appliance problem This is a company that makes me feel proud to be an American Thnx again guys
5,Kristina and Jared are professional efficient and overall great cleaners They courteously take the time to listen to my cleaning particulars and then execute those particulars  I have had several cleaners this past year and let all of them go due to their lack of professionalism tardiness or terrible cleaning jobs I dont ever want to be without Kristina  Jared as they are not only very on top of their job but are all around helpful kind and just plan good people that you want to know
5,The service was outstanding They were absolutely great They were very thorough very careful very nice people they did a really great and cleaned everything
5,I would highly recommend Kristina  Jareds company for any type of cleaning job inside the home andor outside yard clean up They have a great attitude Their prices are very reasonable
5,Excellent cleaning responsiveness and timeliness I tried to explain the size of my house and that there was recent remodeling dust They sent a two person team and quickly expanded it to four to complete the job on my schedule even though they stayed until 7 pm Were looking forward to their return after our move in and unpacking
5,Very thorough first time cleaning
5,They were amazing Jared and Chris showed up right on time at 1000am We walked thru the house and I showed them what I wanted done They got right to work I couldnt stay the entire time but when I got home the house was sparkling My house had not been cleaned professionally for over 2 years and I was actually embarassed by how many dust bunnies there were My hardwood floors were 57 shades lighter all my grout in the bathrooms and kitchen was clean the shower and tub gleamed My 36 stainless steel stove was shiny the oven cleaned all the counters cleanclean clean Initially they were only able to work to 3pm as they had another client I got a call from Jared saying he rescheduled the other client sorry because he just couldnt leave the house half done they stayed til 6pm to finish I am so pleased with this service I have signed up for biweekly cleaning and look forward to having Chris come clean again Jared is very pleasant and professional
5,So quickly so completely and so pleasantly that I couldnt believe it I highly reccomend them
5,Kristina and Jared are great They cleaned our home in a very thorough and professional manner dusting ceiling fans counter tops and flooring They have been arriving on time and complete their work very efficiently The products that they bring and use seem to really work leaving the rooms with a very fresh scent We highly recommend this team
5,Jared and Kristina are very good at listening to your requests and cleaning your home the way you wantneed it to be cleaned I appreciated their willingness to hear my needs and address them
5,It went really well Kristina and Jared spent the whole day completing the cleaning and left the house in spectacular shape Sinks dishwasher blinds bathtub et al looked brand new The moveout inspection went really well and the agent commented on how great the house looked I couldnt be happier with the results Thanks
5,We were on a tight schedule to move from our condo in University City and needed to know that our cleaners would leave the place perfect Kristina and Jared adjusted their schedule for us after our movers were late and Kristina and Jared did a spectacular job We had two large glass enclosures on showers that were perfect when they finished detailing them We had teak hardwood floors and they cleaned them to perfection We had granite countertops and they were beautifully cleaned They took care of details we would not have thought of and were professional and considerate We cant recommend them enough
5,PLEASE DO NOT HIRE KRISTINA AND JARED We dont want to lose them They are a delightful couple who have the hardworking prideindoingagoodjob that one sees too infrequently these days They are smart communicative pay attention to detail and remember and honor special requests with great care Somehow they manage to combine these attributes with such an easygoing disposition that despite our very private natures we are quite comfortable with them in our home They consistently make every effort to go above and beyond expectations while even taking moments here and there to interact with our granddaughter and dogs They are so gracious theyre actually amused when our dog attacks their mop They make every effort to schedule timely service and are super responsive with returning callstexts Weve had them help with special projects including washing windows jambs and screens that hadnt been washed in the almost two years since we bought the house plus who knows how many more years Clean windows can make a house shine the windows sparkled when they were done As an added bonus it was cute watching them work together on the windowsKristina on the inside Jared on the outside pointing out spots to each other My husband is 100 disabled combat veteran and we are have our 10month old granddaughter in our home Jared is available to help with my honey do list which is so incredibly valuable to me The list is long so for now we have just worked on prioritizing projects and starting with one thing at a time I have a lot of remodeling experience and know that Jared has a solid understanding of the work required with each different project Further I can see the same pride in doing a good job with regard to his handyman services So please Dont hire them I really need them And I had them first
5,Great job done
3,This cleaning was ok
5,Went well thanks
5,Very well they were very through
5,Excellent
5,It went well
5,Excellent service provided
5,They were great
5,Great work Very professional
5,The two cleaners were excellent
5,Kristina and Jared did a deep clean that left my house looking smelling and feeling pristine It was also a heroic job as they came in the middle of our unusual heat wave and I dont have air conditioning They are the most professional and the nicest most genuine cleaners I have ever used in over 30 years in three different countries as well as three different US states They take so much pride in their work that you know you are getting your moneys worth I would definitely use them again and would recommend them to friends
5,They were very professional Cleaned all of the house including blinds and fan blades They cleaned inside of cabinets and drawers The house was very clean when they left
5,I really only expected to get an estimate but since it had been a couple weeks or more since things were cleaned the housecleaning was welcomed Also as I said their rate was only slightly higher than I had been paying but their friendliness professionalism attention to detail etc was well worth it The advantage was having both a woman and manhandyman present so things went much faster and tasks that werent really house cleaning were not problematic an broadens the scope of problems that can be addressed I realize that we both have a learning curve ahead of us so it will take several visits to learn each others preferences
5,Jared and Kristina are an amazing duo I chose them because we were moving out of our rental and needed both cleaning and handiwork They came and did a meticulous job getting the house prepared for painting repairing holes replacing shelving and more They worked diligently and thoroughly I will certainly use them again
5,Both Kristina and Jared are very nice personable and professional They arrived promptly and asked how I wanted things done They were very open to any suggestions and were very understanding about how our home is set up due to disabled members of our family Our house had not been cleaned in a long time and they took their time and did a thorough job Even as they worked they took the time to come and ask me my preferences on cleaning certain things I have terrible sinus allergies and many cleaning products give me headaches Kristina and Jared used nonoffensive products and when the shower required a stronger cleaner they made certain to open windows and turn on the fan for me They even noticed the high levels of dust and recommended my filters needed to be checked With my permission they checked the filters and replaced one that was overdue for a replacement They also had no problems with my dogs too Im VERY satisfied with the job they did and have scheduled them to come back
5,Professional trustworthy effective and reliable Jared and Kristina bring high quality workmanship to housecleaning They beam with motivation and take great deal of pride in doing high quality work They have been on time every time and have worked hard from the second they walk through the door They clean every corner and find things I would have missed  they even cleaned the AC filters and replaced the battery in a dying smoke alarm They are fast and they do a fantastic job I dont know what kind of cleaning products they use but my house smells AMAZING when they leave They are both very sweet and down to earth A very nice and hardworking couple who seem to genuinely enjoy their work Although I am a private person I am very comfortable having them in my home They are great with animals  I have an cat who is an escape artist and they are impeccable about keeping doors shut and not letting him out I really appreciate their flexibility I needed someone who could come in the evening and they were more than happy to arrange evening appointments  a huge plus
5,Kristina and Jared were able to schedule their services to meet my needs and showed up on time and worked completely to my satisfaction to get my rental home ready for the new tenants Jared pulled nails out of the walls patched sanded and did touch up painting in all the rooms Kristina started by tackling the kitchen and all the appliances They hung the freshly cleaned draperies and repaired the traveler mechanism Windows sparkled inside and out when they were painstakingly washed Both bathrooms were scrubbed and sanitized Nothing was left in the corners Custom cabinetry was thoroughly vacuumed cleaned and polished Tile flooring was swept then vacuumed and then mopped Kristina and Jared accomplish in a full day what would have take others much longer to accomplish They are a very pleasant young couple with admirable work ethic and high standards They ensured that I was satisfied with all that they accomplished I would not hesitate to use them again and recommend them to others
5,For many years I had one of my best friends clean my apartment Shes a perfectionist and although I knew I was lucky to have her it wasnt until she moved away that I realized how lucky I was Ive tried several cleaning services in the past few years Lazy and apathetic describes most of the people coming to clean Although some have been very nice and respectful if youre not a good cleaner willing to work hard and fast whats the point Now thanks to Angies List Ive found Karen and Jared They showed up on time Theyre easy to talk to and hard working Its obvious theyre passionate about their job showing an attention to detail as if they were cleaning their own apartment With other services I was surprised to find one thing after another missed or not done right after they were done and gone Not with Karen and Jared There work was perfect and Ill be using them from now on Thanks Angies List
5,Kristina and Jered did a phenomenal job Weve used two cleaning services in the past before using Kristina and Jered including one that was highly rated with Angies List who won one of those Band of Neighbor awards and Award of Excellence We got a deep cleaning and one routine cleaning through this service While the deep cleaning was fine the routine cleaning was not up to par We live in a twostory house and the kitchen was not clean Floors were still dirty It was a mess We did not get very good customer service through that group despite my trying for two weeks and given them the benefit of the doubt That is when I found Kristina and Jered again through Angies List and they have exceeded our expectations We are very pleased with them and they were better than the cleaning service that won those awards They are professional and courteous and pay attention to detail and want to make sure that expectations are met They are so much better than the prior cleaning service that won all those awards and was recognized by Angies List I would highly recommend them
5,After having a deep clean of our home we asked Kristina and Jared to schedule regular cleanings They are a delightful personable young couple who work really well together We instantly felt at home with them They are professional punctual courteous hard workers and self starters We feel very comfortable leaving our home to them Their attention to detail is incredible Their work leaves things not just clean but sparkling I have been amazed with what they have done When the windows were done it looked as if the panes had been removed they were so clean They always go above and beyond what would be expected For example one day I had just unloaded the drier and clean clothes were on the bed When we returned from the doctor appt the clothes were neatly folded Having a seriously ill person in the home has brought out their kindness and consideration as well It is obvious they are very caring and thoughtful The use of green products has been very helpful and leaves such a nice smell In addition to the outstanding housekeeping Jared is also a handyman and has noticed and offered to repair things caulking in the bathroom repairing a skylight clearing off leaves and twigs off our flat roof Everything Kristina and Jared have done has been outstanding and amazing We have tried two other housecleaning services previously which we thought were acceptable at the time but there is no comparison to the work Kristina and Jared have done They truly are a godsend to us
5,We actually enjoyed having Jared and Kristina come to our apartment They were extremely pleasant to be around and they worked very well together They pointed out areas where we needed to call in the landlord for some repairs such as a leakingrunning toilet and were very helpful in giving us some solutions to some of our ongoing issues When it turned out that they would be late for our appointment they kept in touch with us so we would know when to expect them and they finished within the fourhour time period that we had been quoted Thanks so much Jared and Kristina
5,Fantastic Kristina and Jared were very friendly and flexible on the phone in discussing what we were looking for in a cleaning service for my parents house We scheduled a day and time within a few days They showed up on time and just were just as friendly and flexible in person They asked what we wanted done made some recommendations and got to work They worked quickly but didnt hurry and took care that everything was sparkling clean and put back into place Their work is great theyre easy to work with and we couldnt be more pleased We scheduled regular cleaning before they left
5,They were very conscientious and treated the project as if they were painting and fixing their own home They worked tirelessly until the job was done
5,I have been using Kristina and Jared for several months and am very pleased with their service They are timely and will text or call if they are running early or late They are friendly and efficient and seem very detail oriented They are accommodating to our partially remodeled home newer half much easier to clean than older half I have tried many services and individual housekeepers over the years and am very comfortable with them in my home and have no concerns having them here while Im away I am interested in my house being truly clean  behind doors behind furnishings occasionally obviously dusted ceiling corners etc I like having Kristina and Jared because they understand I would rather pay for a little more time and have them do a little deeper cleaning rather than a superficial dusting with carefully folded towels
5,Kristina and Jared arrived on time asked specific questions about how I wanted things done and finished within the projected time They provided great attention to detail and did an excellent job They even went above and beyond on little things like putting my dirty sheets in the washer and dryer before they left I was very comfortable leaving them alone in my home and would recommend them highly without reservation
5,Perfect outcome
5,They did a good job
5,Their work was excellent

5,See above review box
4,We were referred to Doug Canada by a friend for whom he had made and installed custom cabinetsdrop zone near their kitchen We were pleased with Dougs thorough and professional manner He was very amenable to working with our special requests As for the carpentry portion of it I couldnt be happier Considering the age of house and the level of difficulty I was very impressed with Dougs skill The door was properly hung and closes in perfect alignment The weather stripping threshold exterior and interior trim are flawless We did some staining ourselves because we wanted to use two different colors to highlight the carving but the contractor finished the interior side the second coat and the polyurethane sealer There were some surprises on the job for example the contractor had to remove a row of brick header in order for the door to fit for some reason the opening is shorter than the standard Later we had a minor delay and misunderstanding over the staining who was going to do what and whether or not the original quote would cover the labor cost However the issue was handled with honesty and professionalism and we were able to work it out to both our satisfaction The only reason I am not giving the job an excellent rating is because I had to touch up some of the stain and poly each night plus scrape the windows Ideally the job could have been a little bit neater However we were still more than satisfied with the overall performance and the pricevalue We would definitely recommend this contractor
5,Arrived at the specified time and completed changing my shower heads expeditiously He has completed other jobs for me as well
2,Vic was nice enough when he did the job but theres a gap in one transition and on another the adhesive didnt work Touch ups were scheduled and blown off numerous times and now i cannot get a response
1,Vic abandoned the project after payment was made Would not recommend as a contractor
5,Victor was professional and dependable He provided excellent communications fast response and timely service He was very easy to work with
1,Owner Victor Womack took my deposit and never performed the work He has not returned my calls or texts messages Had to file a civil case against him and his company
5,Fantastic Quick and clear communication from the start Showed up on time explained the work that was needed and worked efficiently Very professional and courteous Would definitely contact Prop Flipper for future work needed
5,The job went very well He was very thorough and paid attention to details during the job I was very satisfied

5,He was very professional meticulous and cleaned up after which I appreciated because Ive had some contractors in to do work and had to clean up their messes He also took the time to explain the process to me before starting
5,Vic was great hes very professional and completed work in a timely fashion He called back days later to make sure everything was still working fine and I invited him back out to do more work Good help is hard to find so I will be keeping Vic on sped dial for future project
5,Excellent Fast and friendly
2,Did not go well Oscar was very disrespectful on phone and in person in more than one conversations He also added 150 after originally quoting me In the end he completed the project but refused to send me pictures I was out of town and had to send someone else to take pictures of completed work to send to HOA I paid 50 less than others but I guess you get what you pay for I would rather work with someone who takes more money but is professional and courteous I do not recommend Oscars company
1,Horrible he gave me a price on Saturday then came to do the job on Wednesday and renegotiate the price because of materials then tried to use old rotten wood I told him to leave
3,They did a fair job However I will continue my search for my next handyman job
5,Oscar and his contractors were prompt they completed the job to satisfaction and left a clean workspace They repairedreplaced trim in all of the entryways on my main level They also installed a storm door to my front door They were very careful in their work I would certainly hire them to do more work in my home
5,Perfect A dream come true Installed the side door to the back of house Now I look out over my yard with joy and admiration During this change Oscar and his team insulated the entire side of house OMG the room is so much warmer Thanks a million from Arneda B
5,Very good quality of work Great crew punctual and he was an honest guy
5,I had him do a work at my house and he did a very good job Very professional and a very nice person to work with I would totally recommend him and would call him again if I need more work to be done
5,Perfect Very professional and precise Cleaned up and presented the deck I dreamed of On schedule too Thanks again
5,It went very good although I had to wait for the replacement several months due to an erroneous delivery of window Otherwise the work was excellent
5,Oscar Does good work at a reasonable price He has done small handyman work and large improvements and renovations Will hire him again
5,Very well especially in bad conditions
5,Frank was on time and professional He had the job done in less than an hour Excellent job well done Anne went out of her way to remain in contact until my job was scheduled She provided great and quick service Thank you so much
5,I had a problem on garage sinking at the back he was able raise the roof a bit and was able to change the board and while doing the replacement of the boards he saw chipmunks nest in side the wall so he put a reinforced 6 inch wide backboard on the base to keep the chipmunks from coming back And on the Back Porch he installed new strom door on and put a new light as well he also stained the porch and the picnic table and it was excellent he did everything I wanted him to do and and he did it well
5,He does a good job and I highly recommend him to everybody
1,I requested a quote from them 2 times There has been absolutely no response Nothing to indicate that they would or could do the job If they called today I would not hire them NO RESPONSE
1,Called 3 times receptionist was very nice but no one would ever get back to me They wont come out to look at a job you have to email them pictures hoping someone will get back to you I waited a week and no one ever got back to me
5,Did everything I need and done it quickly Reasonable price They work fast and do a great job I get the same guy every time Great with details
5,Were happy with the service and weve been using them for years now
5,Very good Chris was punctual friendly and professional  We will have him back for future projects
2,Never showed up to estimate or return calls
5,excellent I had used them for years
5,They helped me out in a pinch Husband had a hip replacement and we realized we did not have the proper stair railings to help him go up and down the stairs They came out quickly and installed the extra railings we needed Matched the new railings shape to the existing railings and cleaned up afterwards
2,The initial visit was fine I had a good vibe that the man who visited to assess the job was knowledgeable and trustworthy He said he didnt know they were still doing this kind of work but would take it back to the shop and someone would contact me with pricing and timing After 5 days I recalled the number spoke to a woman and told her Id gotten no response She said shed contact Mr Handyman and have someone call me I never got a call either pricing or refusing the job I rated them a B on punctuality because of the initial contact and a D on professionalism because no one ever followed up I understand the job may have been something they didnt want to do thats fine But if they cant even call a prospect to refuse the job their right to do so why would I ever call them again to become a customer
5,The person did an excellent job on the walls You can no longer tell they were separated
5,I received a phone call from their office telling me that my handyman was picking up some materials for the job and would be a few minutes late He was literally only a few minutes late He wasted no time setting up his equipment and immediately went to work The quality of his work was excellent Halfway through this project I asked him to do some additional work installing a French Cleat system in my basement work area He agreed but indicated that he would have to go pick up some more material That trip took very little time and he returned and finished the job expeditiously The whole project was completed within their original time estimates including the additional French Cleat system and the only differential in cost was for the additional materials We were very pleased with Mr Handyman and we are thinking of several more projects he can do in the future
5,Mr Handyman was prompt professional and neat Jim showed up assessed the situation and made the necessary repairs and cleaned up I have 2 more projects and I will not hesitate to contact Mr Handyman in the future
5,All of the techs that were sent for the variety of jobs we were having done were very professional did very good quality work solved some challenges with our old house that required creative solutions were very quick to start work communicated very well throughout the project We had a great experience with the team and will definitely hire them again for future projects
5,Great on time very courteous Hardly knew they were here until they showed me the well finished project
5,The repair man was on time courteous and professional  The work was completed quickly and properly He made suggestions that made the project better He cleaned up afterwards 
5,Very well Barbara was a wonderful receptionist and took all my many messages and took all the details down and shared them with the workers Excellent communication was handled with all involved Also James was the worker who came out and he did an excellent job I was so pleased that he knew immediately that the cupboard doors could be moved up so they would open after a refrigerator had been put in Plus he fixed our swinging door so it would work next time better when we need to take it off He tried it out once to make sure it would work I was very pleased with both people I worked with from this company and would highly recommend
5,I am always pleased with their work Thus I continue to call them for other small tasks that I cannot do The communication with Mr Handyman is very good regarding scheduling any delays and desired specifics about how you want the job done or any needed hardware
5,He fixed our patio door that got pushed off its track and showed me what to do if it happened again Would definitely use them again
5,Terrific from the price quoting phase to the final installation including providing insurance documentation and W9
5,It went well The technicican showed up in the morning I let him in He was done and sent me my bill by noon The work was well done and clean
5,Mr Handyman is an awesome service for so many reasons Im sure different people use it for different reasons but personally Im a small business owner who is renovating a house and its a lot to manage without help Prioritizing things like small repairs and assembling furniture is extremely difficult for me and its so valuable to have a resource like Mr Handyman who I know will come to my home exactly when they say they will and just get it done right Its really different from hiring your runofthemill contractor because you know exactly who youre getting and they have a repeatable methodology for customer service and project execution You will never experience a late handyman a lack of professionalism or a job poorly doneits just not how they do things Theyre also really transparent about quoting and billing so you know exactly what youll payI know that any of their staff would be knowledgeable and skilled so youre safe with anyone I do have to mention though that I am so thankful to have found Dan He is an excellent handyman and person I have been so absolutely happy with his service he does everything beautifully and goes way out of his way to make sure everything is done the way I want it He is professional considerate and makes it clear that his main concern is making sure Im satisfied plus Im pretty sure theres nothing he cant do
5,Nice job   very pleased  Nick was the installer  very nice  organized  cleaned as worked  and made sure he looked over the area not to leave any debris 
5,It went great They did it while I was at work and I always get a little nervous when Im not there to clarify any questions the contractors might have However they did everything perfectly and I feel they even went above and beyond my request in getting the vinyl siding nailed down and secure
5,Very quick to come and give estimate and quick to complete the project
5,It was great They responded to my inquiry the same day and sent a technician out the following day to quote the project I accepted the quote on Friday and he did the work on Monday Jon was polite and worked efficiently and cleaned up after the job was done The final cost was well within the quoted price
5,everything was done promptly and under the estimate
5,Its under new management and its even better than it used to be
5,In each project I found Mr Handyman to be reasonable priced and their technician Jim was very professional I am pleased with the overall result of each project and would definitely use them again in the future
5,Good job prompt and took no time at all
5,Trying to find a contractor to do small jobs can be a real challenge This company has outstanding responsiveness completed the job quickly and does excellent work Hence As in all categories
5,On time and were very professional
2,No work was performed since no one contacted me
5,The technician James was personable knowledgeable and aimed for perfection in his work All aspects of the job were completed at a high level of quality  the replacement fascia boards above my front door were especially challenging and were done perfectly I was also impressed with the speed at which the work was executed The communications from the home office were also excellent and helped to keep me informed throughout the process Im glad to have found a reliable option for this type of work in the future  finding a good contractor is always a challenge
5,Excellent He was really nice and he did a good job He put a tarp down Very good They did the job the same day they came out to give me an estimate They were right on time He was very good Definitely use again
4,The work got done though it was completed by someone with little experience in these areas They did come back and fix the problems I noticed so in the end it was ok
5,Wonderful Technician Nick came out and repaired my deck and did an excellent job and was done in 2 hours and it was very affordable
5,He did some work a couple of jobs for me about an year ago I was fine with him Two was a little bathroom window One is a bay window Three separate windows They must have misunderstand me and we got it straighten out So they replaced the two windows in the middle and as they were doing the work outside they called me outside one day and wanted to show me something If I had only had an window company come in and changed the windows I probably would have not had happened When they started pulling off the trim of the window they noticed in the bay the insulation pretty much was gone So I told them to go ahead and do the work They pull off everything else and my house has been cold a long time but there was virtually no insulation in there So they found it and with my permission they padded up allsealed it all up with insulation and did wood trim on the outside and they did a great job
5,I had a handle where the lock part wasnt working anymore I didnt like the handle to begin with I asked if they was going to be time to repair that if it was going to be possible to replace all that and I tried to specify what kind of handle I really wanted not the original one that came with the door I was very happy Thats all I can say Now I dont pinch myself I open the screen door I never have them come out for just one item I want to say it was a paint job These are really simple jobs Touch up jobs inside
5,Have used before They do good work Usually they charge by the hour and then I pay for the part they had to buy Its usually a set rate They couldnt get me just the deadbolt alone We had to get the set with the deadbolt with the handle My daughter said something the other day said she couldnt get it open very well Im watching to see if thats going to be a problem I try to make sure I have enough things for them to do for the whole hour so you get your moneys worth
5,They are down in my book as the people I turn to because Ive been happy with their services all the time
4,The price seems pretty fair On bigger jobs they send two people but most times just one Ive had a pretty good experience theyve done a lot better then the people I used before
5,very well they were extremely professional showed up on time and were done before i knew it didnt think it would make that much of a difference but now im almost too hot so i took my shirt off
5,Dan was the technician and he was so friendly and clearly knew what he was doing My fencing had some damage and I was worried about my dogs getting out Mr Handyman made an appointment promptly and Dan arrived on time and finished quickly Not only did he fix my fencing but when he was done he fixed other areas of my fencing that needed some work This puts my mind at ease with my dogs and I am so happy I chose Mr Handyman Thank you for your quick and above and beyond work
5,Great service with Nick and Mr Handyman He arrived right ontime was professional polite and did a great job Completed all of my projects including fan assembly and removal very quickly and without issue Will absolutely be hiring them again
5,I am a Dan fanbig time He works really fast cleans up eager to help and do a job right He seems to ask himself how he could do a job differently to save me money Dan the Handyman is a great help to me
2,Three business days before my scheduled appointment of June 21 2016 they called and cancelled Jim from Mr Handyman gave no reason other than they couldnt do it at this time I had a door jamb that was broke and the door was not lockable so I pleaded for them to please just do that one for safety He agreed and sent someone over on June 21 2106 they had given me an estimate 45700 and 4 hours to replacerepair the jamb and 50 in materials The worker arrived at 1245 and left at 245 and left for 12 hour during that time to get material he had forgot They charged me the 45700 I spoke to Mike at Mr Handyman on July 13th at 1000 am to discuss why they had not called me to schedule the work on the other two doors He said Jim had said I cancelled the other two jobs which I did not At that time I discussed the cost of the door jamb with labor at 200 per hour one man He said the labor includes costs for the time it takes to get to the job as well as the time it took him to come out and do an estimate of the job several weeks earlier I let him know that this does not seem appropriate as they did not do the rest of my job and they obviously did an abbreviated job on this door jamb since it only took half of the time he estimated He agreed to refund 100 of the 45700 I had paid and call me back to schedule the remaining jobs they cancelled after he looked at his schedule  It is now September 1st and I have never heard from him and never received the 100 refund
1,Never called back and never showed up FAIL
5,Did a great job on a project that many other companies wouldnt even touch Great communication Did what they said they would do when they said they would do it and charged what they said it would cost Would definitely use again and would recommend to others
3,Problem was solved to my satisfaction and raised the grade to a C
5,Michael Fay and his team just completed a third job for me within the last 9 months These guys show up on time work quickly and efficiently and do quality work I have found them to be quite knowledgeable about a diversity of construction related matters They have handled well complex problems that came up during the first two jobs completed for me The first job entailed replacing wood that had rotted over several years due to faulty construction  water had been leaking through siding  and required the replacement of structural materials in the garage The situation was much worse than what we suspected before the guys began the job They did a fine job for what I considered to be a fair price They next remodeled the kitchen We chose to keep the original cabinents When the granite installers showed up they discovered that some of the cabinents were not in shape to support the countertops and the cabinents had not been installed properly some 20 years previous Michael offered to rebuild the cabinents with quality plywood  removing the cheap pressboard material used when these things were manufactured This saved us a lot of money and several weeks of pain that would have come with having a kitchen ripped up while waiting for new cabinents to arrive They did great work also with laying tile and grouting for the back of the countertops Michael and team have shown themselves to be honest and quite skilled in doing many different kinds of work They have skills far beyond what I envision when i hear the word handyman I would recommend anyone in the Cleveland area to at least get a quote from Michael Fay when considering a home repair or upgrade
1,The experience went wrong when they didnt paint the walls carefully Painted an entire door upstairs including the latch They left stains all over the walls They said racial slurs to me concerning hot sauce The doors to the bathroom and laundry rooms were only painted on one side The guy was getting angry and felt like I was trying to tell him how to do his job They were upset that they had to correct their mistakes I kept informing him that I would be trying to sell my house and trying to get top dollar for it Was getting angry that we were informing him of where things needed to be corrected Informed him that there was a product that could remove the stains he had left He began to apply the stain remover after I noticed the stains
5,Very professional and friendly Performed requested repairs timely and did an excellent job Work area was immaculate when they left
5,Installer arrived on time and went right to work He removed the old door and installed the door I bought at a local box store He keep the work area clean and took the old door with him He also filled the gaps in the door frame with insulation The price didnt seem out of line and I will be calling Mr Handyman in the future
5,The workmanship was excellent No complaints
5,I am totally thrilled I have been unable to open my front door since painting was done over a year ago Several of my male friends had attempted to open the door without success Nick spent less than ten minutes and had the door open When I commented that he must be really strong he told me that he worked smart not strong He told me even though I had left the door open for twelve hours after painting the paint continued to cure and it had adhered to the weather stripping If I had remembered to open the door the next day after painting I would have been all right The door opens more easily now than it has in years Nick opened my side door in even less time than the front door He replaced a screw in the top hinge with a longer screw He told me that the problem with that door is the door frame is not totally square because the foundation is no longer level He told me that even though the door looks crooked in the frame it will no longer rub at the top corner because the longer screw holds it in place Before he left Nick told me that if I use the company again I should make a list of all of the things I want done to fill up the time since they charge by the hour Even though Nick had completed the job in about a half hour I was more than happy to write my check because he very efficiently did what my brawny friends were unable to do Nick was friendly and professional and definitely knew what he was doing
5,They arestill doing work for us They get here do the job and if they run into any trouble they work through it
2,Since I have never received the written estimate of costs I would say this was a waste of time having him come over to measure my door
2,After I approved the quote for the first property and the work did not start for a week to ten days I called back and was told that some emails had gotten screwed up and that they were waiting for a part but work would start soon After another week or so I called back I gave all my information and was told that the issue would be looked into and someone would get back to me No one called back that day or the next I called again no less that 3 times and gave my information only to never be called back To this date no one has done any work or called me back to let me know what is going on It has been over a month since my initial call to Mr Handyman Needless to say I am going to find someone else to do the work As far as I know no one has even gone out to the second property to look at the job No one has ever called me back with a quote
5,DELIGHTED WITH QUALITY SKILL AND RESOURCEFULNESS AND WILLINGNESS TO COLLABORATE WITH AN EDUCATED EYE TO COST EFFECTIVENESS
5,My dog ate through my door frame in a panic attack Dan from Mr Handyman came out and cut out the damage and replaced it as good as new Mr Handyman was less than half the cost of other quotes and the work was well done Being a single girl cost is definitely an important factor in my buying decision Great response time friendly techeven showed up early I will call them again in the future Highly recommended A
5,Excellent Everything went smoothly and project was done professionally I will be using Dan in the future for tiling sidesplash in the kitchen and to install a wood floor in the kitchen dining room and living room
5,Day one patch about 12 holes fill in areas around breaker box and first coat of sheetrock day two second coat of sheetrock day three final sand smooth areas needed hardly any sanding and texture ceiling patches Overall the work was PERFECT Super high quality work The man who did the work came in assessed the situation and got right to work I will admit it is not an easy task we gave him and thats why it cost so much in the end they worked quickly and did excellent work which was important because we were trying to get our house ready to sell and didnt want holes everywhere in the basement as an unfinished project I should have called them a year ago instead of thinking I could do it myself
5,We have contracted Deitmars services several times for various odd jobs around our home Most recently he installed a ceiling fan and inwall safe He is always professional cleans up any mess and punctual We will continue to contact Deitmar whenever we have an odd job  would highly recommend
1,They came out and basically wrote down everything that I needed to have done which I thought I could have just given them over the phone The guy that came out said that could not give me an estimate but someone else would reach out within two days with the estimate I waited over two weeks and have not heard back from them
5,good jobon time and professionaland cleaned up the mess
1,Mr Handyman never showed up for his service appointment Please do not schedule with them
1,Called twice and left a message twice the week of 552014 Never got a return phone call
5,Misc services Hanging curtain rods pictures shelves Fix leaking shower
4,Chose a different contractor based on expedited scheduling requirements
1,unfortunately I was told he did not provide service on the NE side Or should I say my home address Athough the ad states East and West
5,Very prompt and on time Always cleans up Does a great job with everything
5,It went fine Handyman easily and quickly repaired the door and exposed brick outside He also mounted a few photos He was on time professional and friendly
1,Charged me to come and fix the gutter guards that they have installed Gutter guards have COMPLETELY fallen off I have called there 5 times and I get the same response that someone in the office will get back to me however no one has bothered to call me I have given them an ample opportunity to come out and fix this issue All they have to do is call me one time and we can rectify this problem I would tell them to not ignore your customers Showed up at my house without contacting me luckily I was able to come home to oversee the work If they come out and fix this issue all will be well
5,Worker arrived in timely fashion and finished what he could He could not do the tuckpointing because it was raining so he came back the next day and finished that part This is the third time Ive used this company and have yet to be disappointed
4,It went well Contractor was on time courteous and offered a costeffective solution to the repairs
5,It went well He was prompt We told him what we needed done and he took care of it It took him less than half a day
5,because we had already moved to N Carolina Michaels team had additional hurdles to gain access for several visits our realtor said that they had done a great job and we will use him again if we need anything else done
5,fine do not send this again as you have sent it multiple times and i have submitted this in the past yr service is good but please do not send me anymore reviews to fill out for mr handyman avon ohio thanks
5,Michael was prompt each and every visit This gave our tenants confidence that hed be there when told at least 1 day in advance
1,The handyman worked for a few hours on various projects for us then proceeded to make a slew of freshman mistakes during the course of the day He incorrectly hung up our towel rack did not use a leveler so it was lopsided and did not ask me where we wanted it to be placed then started to put together my babys dresser There was a damaged part of the dresser and he continued to put this together without asking me what the next steps were eg continue to put it together or disassemble it since we needed to return it When I confronted the technician about this he would NOT discount my rate He left angry left a semiassembled dresser and would not take responsibility for his actions Not only that but he also had a laundry list of projects left for him that were unfinished I contacted Michael Fay who only agreed to discount my rate and come out days later to both disassemble the damaged dresser and reassemble the new one as I had a limited amount of time to disassemble the dresser and return it to in order to get a new dresser This never happened He was only able to come out days later as they were busy and offered the same technician who did the work before I did not want the original technician to come who did the shoddy work He called a day before coming out and said that they would no longer be coming out and they would just not charge me Days later I received a bill with a discount after he had previously told me that we would not be getting a bill When I informed him that he originally said that I would not be charged he sent a threatening email and said that he had changed his mind Not good business practices I would NEVER work with Michael Fay or any of his technicians ever again Heres why  if you have a client issue you resolve it and fast You never go back on your word if you saw its on us and then charge people You dont leave a project unresolved Lastly you do not threaten your customers I hope that this is a teachable moment for Michael about what not to do
5,The personnel did an excellent job He did his job and finished it at the time he allotted He was a nice guy
5,Overall the experience was very pleasant Within a day after I contacted Mr Handyman through email I received a phone call He made arrangements at my convenience to come to the house and give us an estimate  very happy with the estimate   He informed us that he would watch the weather situation and as soon as it was warmer he would set up the appointment to repair the frame This was also at our convenience as we informed him originally that this project was not urgent and we preferred it not be done until the weather would permit us to do the follow up painting that would be needed after the project was completed As soon as the weather permitted he called us to set up a time to do the job The handyman that came was very punctual and very friendly He explained to me exactly how this happens  the rotted wood  and he described the material that he would be using to replace this section This was a very tight fit and he displayed alot of patience with the continuous measuring and recutting of the material to make it a good fit  The final cost turned out to be even less than the estimate which was a pleasant surprise for us I have other small projects and one by one will be calling Mr Handyman in the future While he was here I had asked for advice on another issue I have and he was very informative and explained several different options that could be used to do that repair Not asking for any kind of an estimate at the time but I was relieved to hear there were different options to resolve that problem also
5,Called for and received estimate Work was scheduled to be performed at our convenience Repairman was punctual knowledgeable and friendly Price was very fair and work is very good
5,Overall it was a good experience I gave a B for price only because i normally do my own work but couldnt reach the vents I also gave a B for quality only because the individual who performed the work left some screws in the driveway where they were parked
4,The caprenters name was Jim very nice and knew just what to do I had a leaky porch roof and needed some stairs rebuilt They make the steps at their plant and brought them to the house All was done in the two days they said they would be
5,It went very well from the initial estimate to the finished work The estimate was what I was expecting to pay and the follow through and actual work was done professionally and promptly I am very pleased
5,I have used them before They knew my house and I knew them which made it much easier They were quite reasonable and worked quickly They had all the equipment They did a really good job and did what I wanted
5,They were very nice and did a great job They were professional and I was very pleased with the service
5,It was excellent they were friendly and did the job well
5,The owner came to my house the night before my schedule appointment to take a look at what needed to be done exactly When Bill the handyman showed up the next day he was fairly well prepared on what needed to be done He cut out one plank I was afraid more would need to be removed about 16 inches long and popped in a new one Bill was very nice and let me watch as he worked All in all it took about an hour and it was all finished
1,It didnt go at allwe did notwill not hire him after poor responsiveness to request for an estimate
5,I called Mr Handyman and requested an estimate for the repairs to my porch Mike was that person who came out within that week and gave me a prompt estimate over the phone the same day I was still looking for other estimates  which I had to wait 3 weeks for I found that the price was much lower that the others When we scheduled the work they were out within 1 week The work was done within one day I thought one board on the porch looked funny and he come out right away and replaced it No muss no fuss He will be handling all of my repairs in the future Way to go Mike
1,There were two stages to the job Removed the roof and the supports of columns He did not replaced them and replaced it with a thinner grade for the roof After he took 4500 for the discounts he did not take that off The total came out to 298000 I realized that the job did not look supportive and the chair were puncturing the roof He offered a full deck roofing to be put down I could not do it because I was leaving He said he would womanized replacement on the roof He punctured the roofing materials and it was no longer good By that time I was gone I asked my brother to go and take a look at it My son who is a roof carpenter was so upset for the work Im back now and I need to get the work done now
5,They did a nice job The young guy showed right up and looked over things and told me how much it would be Then within a few days a gentlemen showed up and did the painting and everything was good They were prompt and nice They got everything finished in one day and didnt mess around I would definitely call them again for work around the house
5,Very efficient with call back to review work to be done and provide estimate Quick scheduling of work and gentleman that performed the work was very friendly and professional and did a great job Trim looks great
1,Came out and looked at our utility room and our small bathroom We didnt hear from him for two weeks Finally I called for the proposal I feel he should have called us sooner also he wanted to charge us 200000 for the work Which i feel was way over priced for the work
2,I had some issues with the work that they did but it got resolved They completed 90 of how the work should have been completed I spent a few bucks on them to complete it It is complete now but there were some hazels with the guy who was running it Now everything is complete They customized some stuff in the kitchen for me but I have an issue with the final work that they did I spent a week and a half with them I gave them a shot because their overall pricing was good I needed them to fix something that they had to put together but I ended up having to make them do some work after I paid them Now they have got the money so I am probably not going to use them again
5,I have been using this company 7 years They are excellent and always finish the job They are reasonably price and are punctual
4,I have a strong recollection not of what he looked like but of what he worked like I would not call him again I had him install a wall shelfwhich I asked him to attach to the wall He had to do it twice because the first time it was not level  He had a helper with him who did nothing but hand him tools He charged what I would say was a considerable amount Other than charging too much he was fine
4,He was good The door went and it works They are right on time and cleaned up after themselves
5,I had a pull chain previously They came in and put a new light switch They were not very expensive and the quality of work was good I was satisfied with their service
5,They explained everything to me and the job went very well I like that I can call them up and they will come out usually within the week They will accommodate my schedule and have even come on a weekend I will use them again
4,The appointment manager returned my call promptly unlike other electircians that I had called He asked that I send him a picture of the fixture and sent someone out The actual serviceman found that he needed to go buy a new fixture but he did so and replaced it He was professional and courteous Unfortunately due to the unplanned shopping trip he asked that we reschedule having the garage grounded which had originally ben included in our request Otherwise we were quite pleased and would use this service again
4,He sent a technician out and he did fine I tried to call the owner to negotiate the estimate but he refused to return my calls He tried to bill me 830 for 3 12 hours of work in total
4,It went very well after Jim G came but he was not the person who came and gave me the estimate Apparently Mr Fri wanted off today I was happy that Jim G got all the work done
5,I recommended him and he did a considerable amount of work for me There was a leak and he did some tile work and repaired the ceiling The leak alternatively was supposed to be fixed by the plumber but which wouldnt He was pretty damn good He came and adjusted our schedule The man he sent was very nice They did the work and the work is nice I thought that the guys who came were a bit slow as they were paid on hourly basis and I thought that they could have done faster They were pleasant and did the work I thought that they took more time but it was okay Basically they were good They did the job and got it done It took two times to diagnose the leak eventually
5,It is not easy to get a provider to do a relatively small job this time of year with constant rain periods requiring schedule adjustment Previous experience with another firm was a total waste of time as they just didnt show up Michael responded with in a few days and had someone up on the roof for a quote quickly Missed one appointment due to rain but came two days laterA huge problem off my plate as I just had surgery
5,I called on Oct 7th and Mr Fay sent someone out the same day to check things out He called back later in the day to say that someone would be out to the house on Monday morning The repairman was very personable concerned and thorough I would absolutely use this company again I do not think that the price is out of line and it is worth it to me to get these nagging little things done In fact the railing on my stairway just broke and Ill probably be calling them again to replace it if they can
5,The work was performed in not the best of conditions The laundry area was crowded and not a lot of room to work The exhaust vent went into the attic and not easily accessible Both problems were solved to my satisfaction
1,never showed for his appointment with us Never called us
1,Did not come to my home to give an estimate or call me back after more than two weeks
5,it went very well  Jim arrived on time and everything was done quickly and neatly
3,I also bought a double lock set so he could replace the locks on the front and back doors He replaced the back door lock but did not touch the front door lock When I tried to use the new key on the front door I had to replace the front door lock myself
5,This is a step by step procedure with time needed in between for drying of materials used in the various phases This my main bathroom  they were prompt in arriving in a timely manner as the were able to continue with the next step I have used them before and will use them again
5,I had water in my basement and was not sure why I called and they came out immediately within an hour and determined that my sump pump had stopped working This was a Thursday They helped me clean up the water and arranged to provide me with a quote for the pump The next day there was more water so I called them again and they were right back One of the gentlemen even offerred to bring me his personal dehumidifier to help dry the space Over the weekend they called to make sure I was not having any more problems On Monday they replaced the sump pump nd the backup pump While they were there they also replaced my doorbell and a couple of very high light bulbs The best part of the service was that it was clear they cared about the service they provided I was not just another customer on the list  they went out of their way to make sure I was satisfied This was not the first time I have used this company and I would do so again without hesitation
1,I sent email and left phone messages and was never contactedfinally just decided to go with someone else
5,They did a wonderful job and I would not hesitate to use them again I would highly recommend them to others They were professional on time and neat
5,It went very well This is the third time that I have had work done by Mr Handyman and I am always pleased with their work
5,EXCELLENT service Complete professionalism expert quality workmanship The gentleman came exactly on time worked incredibly quickly and treated my home with care and respect They will be my go to guys for handy work in the future
5,Everything went very well They are very prompt professional and get everything done right
5,I had pigeons on my bedroom awning so they installed the spikes to take care of the issue Everything was super
2,Michael had come out and gave us an estimate We already had the wood from floors we had done earlier When Michael looked at the project he stated the left over wood would be enough to complete the job He quoted us 1200 for the project and we offered to pay cash for a 100 discount His carpeter Jim showed up two hours late the day of the job As far as the quality of the work it was satisfactory When Jim got to the second landing the last part of the project he stated there was not enough wood to complete He claimed he could use his wood and try to use carpeting as well He did not finish that day and would come back on Tuesday 6110 He completed the everything but the second landing on Tuesday We feel we should receive some money back since they did not complete the full project we hired them to do I asked them if it was fair to pay a lower price since they did not complete the contract He was not willing to lower the price to 1000 or 100 off for the incomplete work He became very upset and would only lower the price to 1040 After speaking with Jim Michael hung up the phone before explaining the same price to me I waited on the phone for him to talk to me about it after speaking with Jim but he did not I was very upset by this lack of courtesy I also wanted to use the coupon through Angies List 25 off and they made this seem like a large issue as well I decided not to push the issue since they were unwilling to work with us on the incomplete job If he was willing to charge 1000 for the work I would have been satisfied
5,He repaired the door problem and installed the closer in a short time I had to pay a one hour minimum so I had him move a nightstand and my bed to make wheelchair access easier
5,Everything turned out well The water damage on the ceiling looked great when they were done and it blended in perfectly The price is very good and they are courteous and prompt Having the debris removed took a little longer than I would have liked but they were neat otherwise I was happy with their work and would use them again
5,They are fantastic When I called the company they said they could do it the next morning because I had to work around a doctor appointment which was no problem They were here promptly and were very courteous and friendly They just took control of everything and got the job done I loved them and it looks beautiful
5,He fixed that and also he did a few other things to finish the hour he was charging us for He was super and I would recommend him to others
5,Good job No supervision needed Only they wanted a credit card hold  probably because I was a first time customer
4,I was told that the job was relatively small and would probably only take an hour They could be out the following afternoon I had to provide the make and color of our vinyl siding When I got home the following afternoon nothing was done I waited until Thursday morning and called to see what happened When the worker picked up the piece of siding he didnt know until he reached the house that the store gave him the wrong color He had to go back and get the right color The office person was very apologetic that no one called to let me know They came that afternoon and fixed the corner It looks great
5,I was very pleased with their work They were very professional They were on time and cleaned up after themselves i would definitely refer them to other people
5,We have had no problems at all and the project turned out well
5,Good experience Im an outofstate landlord so my tenant called Mr Handyman based on word of mouth The person who took the call recommended that we obtain a new disposer rather than buy through them in order to save some money That worked out well and the repair work was painless for my tenant
5,He did a good job on each and I am thinking of hiring him again
4,The owner was fine The man who came to fix our siding tried to charge us over 200 more than the original quote I had to tell him what the original quote was and so he called the employee to check if that was correct It made for an awkward situation I did pay them a little extra for working hard but I was still thrown for a loop Overall I was pleased with the quality of the work
5,Jim was great He works very hard and the quality was excellent
5,I spoke to Kathy and she was very good and professional over the phone They are acceptable and I was very happy to talk to a live person instead of a voice mail They are there everyday apparently from 9 to 5 and I really like that I would most definitely call them again if need be
5,They are very nice and competent They corrected everything They have done very neat work I am very pleased
4,It did not take very long to get the wallpaper off The employee patched the drywall and let this work day overnight He returned the next day to prime the surface and paint it Since he painted the surface shortly after priming it there was a tendency for the primer and paint to mix andor for the paint to mix with caulk that he applied between the showerbath fixture and wall to prevent future moisture penetration A few weeks later I put an layer of paint on most of all of the surface above the bathshower
5,He did good work and at a fair price
1,IN MY ESTIMATION MR HANDYMAN SHOULD NOT HAVE EVEN CONSIDERED CHARGING MORE THAN 4050 WHEN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WAS ACCOMPLISHED THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS A REAL SHOCK TO ME SINCE MY EXPERIENCE WITH CONTRACTORS RATED A ON ANGIES LIST HAVE UP UNTIL TODAY BEEN EXTREMELY PROFICIENT AND WORTHY OF THEIR EXCELLENT A RATING MR HANDYMAN GETS AN F
5,They were very good  were very prompt with returning phone calls very professional  did an excellent job of diagnosing the problem  correcting it I would hire them again in the future
5,They were trustworthy nice pleasant professional and did a very good job
5,It was very good He just seemed to be very knowledgeable about being a handyman He gives out a very confident air about him He was very respectful and polite
5,This company was great and I will use them again They came out in the exact time frame I needed The worker was very professional and when I called they gave me some suggestions to help me save money The final service ended up being less expensive than the quoted price on the phone Overall this company is very efficient and I would recommend them and use them anytime in the future
5,On time very polite good job  reasonably priced
5,Jim worked hard and professionally the whole time he was here He had the right tools for the jobs except on one occasion I was very pleased with his work When he was done I finished by painting the posts and caps and they look good
5,I hired the Mr Handymen crew 2  3 times while preparing to put our house on the market They were very responsive willing to do a variety of jobs even adding some newly discovered jobs onto their list after they had come to the house If they didnt have the tools they needed they ran out to get it Very easy to work with fast and efficient
5,Mr Handyman gives you the option to purchase your own goods I chose them to purchase and do the work They charge 130 an hour It seemed high to me but since I cannot do the work I was satisfied that it was done in a timely manner
5,The technicians were very helpful courteous and personable I have used them for larger jobs in the past and would definitely use them again
3,I wouldnt hire him for doing my lights again I just thought that he was too expensive for putting up just Christmas lights The work was adequate though
5,They were fine They were able to do the work just fine and they were very easy to work with The task was completed before the end of the prepaid time period
4,He charged for one hour regardless of how long the job took
5,They did a great job Professional work man like staff Good office and scheduling support and attention to detail Flexible to small changes Any issues that a rose were handled expertly We are having them quote our kitchen remodel now
1,STOP Beware Don t let their ad confuse you Mr Handyman was hired to install a shower door in a brand new bathroom While they were on the job we added the tissue holder and towel bar We contacted Mr Handyman because the door was leaking They sent out a tech to assess the problem  sealed where the thought the leak was Needless to say it was still leaking after use of the shower This went on for many days and many visits for Mr Handyman to attempt to correct this problem Michael Fay owner had us convinced we purchased a defective door We went to a supply store and found Mr Handyman installed the door incorrectly The technician did not use all the hardware and cut the bottom track too short see picture After 30 days of not getting positive results working with Mr Handyman door still leaking hardware still missing mess every time they are back to assess the problem using my tools I requested a full refund Another 30 days pass with numerous request for a refund Michael refuses the refund and wants to continue to come back to stop the leak I felt after 60 days of no results a refund was not asking too much Michael hired an attorney and sent a settlement agreement and release in the amount of 180 We accepted just so we could put an end to this nonsense Mr Handyman is not capable of installing a shower door Mr Handyman charged us 125 to install a tissue holder and towel bar For all the inconvenience damage to the walls adjusting working schedules if any charge at all due should have been the 78 for the first hour per his business description Perhaps Michael is saying it took Mr Handyman over an hour to install a tissue holder and towel bar
5,It went excellent All the phone calls setting up making a list of estimates for me all went great I could decide which ones I wanted to pick from I chose them all His name is Bill Arison
5,Thankful for their willingness to provide immediate service in an emergency
5,He does an excellent job Its 78 for the first hour and 39 for each additional half hour I will continue to use his services
5,The company sent a professional employee to help with some home repairs The work was done expertly and in a timely fashion The fellow who did the work was conscientious he cleaned up after himself and I was comfortable having him in my home I HIGHLY recommend Mr Handyman for help with home repairs I can not say enough good about them
5,All work perfectly and he never cut corners even after I told him that would be acceptable
1,The job was well performed but they charged 8000hour which is pretty steep But to add insult to injury they charge a 4000 appointment fee  I do not pay such a fee when I schedule a doctors appointment or make an appointment for car repair This 4000 is just plain greed Angies List should not honor such businesses that clearly rip off the customer
5,They made an appointment to do the work
4,I didnt the quality of their work They charge by the hour and the job took longer than it should have If I would have know they charged by the hour I wouldnt have hired them
1,Bill came to my house on 921 in order to give me an estimate on replacing my fence As of 1018 he has not contacted me with the estimate
4,I realized the toilet seal was leaking and running down the wall in the garage I knew Mr Handyman was expensive but they were the only ones who could come out within a week I thought Id have to have the flooring repaired but was told it wasnt necessary A few weeks later I noticed a rocking when sitting on the toilet hey came back out and screwed down both bolts on each side of the toilet
5,Brent found that previous owner had added under sink instant hot water heater using outlet previously occupied by dishwasher Dishwasher was now hardwired to lighting breaker Brent came the same day that I called
5,Jim was here at 9 oclock on Monday morning when arrived he said that the cost would be around 13900 Jim repaired the handle on the stove Jim was very fast and also saved me a lot of money because the final cost was 3900
5,Michael was prompt and helpful making suggestions that only a real pro would have known The seller contacted the builder Ryan Homes who sent a crew to make those repairs even though the home itself was past the warranted period I paid Michael for the beautiful writeup of his estimate great guy to work with Thanks Michael
5,I especially liked the technician that came out he was very professional and knowledgeable They were very responsive and I got prompt service
4,Company was fine They didnt show up when they were supposed to but they did come out the second time I called
3,They were most responsive I live out of town and they would say they did the work and someone would go look for me and the work wasnt completed
3,Most of the work the carpenter did was excellent There seemed to be some sort of communication error between the owner and the carpenter The entire job was expected to take 15 days It took 25 The owner quoted me 1535 for the work I left a detailed list of what I believed to be part of the quote with a request that someone call me if it deviated from the quote The carpenter built a detailed rail system that was both not asked for and not quoted The owner later tried to charge me for it claiming the facia board  which he apparently didnt quote  took too long I refused and canceled the remaining work He called 2 days later and explained that most of the over run was caused by the rail system He offered to finish the work for the quoted price I agreed to pay a bit more because I like the railing After the dispute I thought the remaining work was slightly sub standard indicating a desire to cut the companies losses Painting was especially bad
5,We were very happy with everything starting with the phone conversation with the person who makes the appointments She explained everything in detail The work was done to our satisfaction and the technician was very professional We would definitely call Mr Handyman for future work
4,Theyre very friendly and efficient
5,Everytime he was on time and did a great job It is nice to have everything in the house working right I would call again
5,Bill was very functional He was neat clean pleasant He came in a head of time finished before the estimated time There were a couple jobs that he said he didnt feel comfortable doing so theyll be back in a couple days with some one else that can price the jobs They originally wouldnt honor the Angies List and I was told by Mr Fay that they put both coupons on this next bill I was told that because this work was a continuation of previous work they would waive the 39 fee They didnt take care of the bill while they were at the house and I had to sign a paper saying that they would take care of it at the office I want 89 refund to honor the 2 coupons and the 39 fee
5,The electrician showed up and installed both lights No problems
5,They were extremely pleasant real flexible My neighbor came over and they took two antennas off his roof Theyre just really nice people to be around
5,He got everything taken care of for me He did a very good job and even though they were different job he knew how to take care of everything
5,Service tech Bill Gantz was punctual well informed pleasant and definitely qualified for my requirements
4,I called them and they were willing to come out the same day to do the work but I was not ready They were at the house the next day and completed the job quickly efficiently and courteously I would definitely call them again
5,The things repaired were things that needed doing since we first moved in They were done well and with a minimum of fuss
5,Overall experience excellent Will definitely use service again Great service for small jobs Very punctual Jim the technician very nice Answered all questions quality of work was great
5,They called to set an appointment for an estimate They arrived on time and spent time evaluating job and talking with us We were given a written estimate and told wed get a call the next day to set time for workman to arrive The time was set the workman arrived punctually and the work was done professionally and to our complete satisfaction Wed call them again without hesitation
5,He fixed the problem and did a good job He was friendly and an overall nice guy
1,When I called I got a sales pitch I let them know what I wanted They said they do not give estimates they only come out and do the job She put me on hold and then said someone would come out the same day to take a look I waited and waited when finally about 430 I received a voiemail saying he wasnt in the area and they would get back to me by the end of the week I never heard from them
5,After trying for weeks to have another handyman come over but never returned calls I called Mr Handyman They were very detailed gave me all the information up front on pricing and how the appointment would be handled They even called the day before to confirm the appointment They were on time very efficient and only charged for the time they were there I will definitely call them again for little things around the house because they were so professional reliable and did a great job
5,Have asked for several estimates They always get back to you with an answer within a week the office girl is very good
5,Dan the service technician for Mr Handyman arrived on right datetime and offered a cordial greeting Kathy Office Admin had left me a confirmreminder message on previous business day which is always nice to get Dan looked over job first set up his sawhorse and tools and got right to work I have used the services of Mr Handyman before and do have confidence in their skills and ability to do the job correctly Mr Handyman does not give estimates paid or not They dont tell you either what job materials to get There is currently a two hour minimum fee so you really have to know what you need to be done and the correct materials on hand to do the job My understanding is they will go and buy the materials for you but that costs extra It forces the customer to research the project in order to buy right supplies before hand That is the part that stresses me the most Live and learn I guess You do get what you pay for your projects promptly and professionally completed
1,I left a message and they have not returned my call
2,He charges 195 for the first hour including just to come out and take a look Following that he charges 1995 per quarter hour I didnt even have him come out because of his price
5,When I called the service asked all the right questions and took great notes When Jim arrived he had a print out of virtually everything I had said so he was very prepared Jim was on time actually 10 minutes early laid down drop cloths and did some of the more grimy work outside to limit the dirt in my house Jim also spent the time to really diagnose my problems rather than jumping to the conclusion that I needed new equipment His diligence and innovative solutions kept me from buying new parts of about 200
5,Very positive The handyman came the same day I called Very pleasant professional and knowledgeable man HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
1,They never called I am disappointed that they never called back to give me an estimate I did think that was unprofessional
5,IVE SAID IT ALL THEY DO WHAT WE DONT HAVE TIME TO DO
2,I feel that they were unprofessional by not getting back to me with an estimate I would not contact them again
5,Fast efficient hard working and thorough worker Brought concrete and 4x4 I had the mailbox I got a free fire extinguisher

5,I am happy as he was on time and done quick He arrived before the scheduled time Labor charge is 78 per hour I thought it was interesting that as soon as he entered the house he put plastic covers over his shoes He was very clean and didnt leave a mess when finished

5,Job went very well Kjell and his crew were very professional and neat Showed up on time Good communication and easy to work with Worked steady and completed the job in a timely manner Would definitely hire them again
5,Excellent Kjell resurfaced and refinished most parts of three bathrooms The project took time but went well and Im very pleased with the result
5,Great job Would definitely hire again Professional nd couteous
1,After a brief description of what I needed the response was I dont mean to be rude but do you want me to take on an afroamerican project When I asked him to explain what he meant he said do you want me to do a fix with like rubberbands and bubble gum Enough said Seems guys like this are less afraid of the light and are crawling out of the woodwork Must be the Trump effect
5,Hes very honest and I would trust him with anything Ill put it this way Id let him be in my house even if I wasnt here
5,Kjell was very busy with other projects but was able to fit us into his schedule Communication was good we kept in touch up until the day before he was supposed to come over to do the installation Day of he showed up early and got to work right away The closet kit he installed looks great and was installed faster than I thought Prices were reasonable I will be calling him again for future needs
5,He is wonderful In fact he is coming today to do some work and I have a list for him He has email and I email him my wish list and he told me when is available and it is going to be an ongoing working relationship He really is very honest and goes by the clock I would continue to use him
4,My experience was kind of mixed My husband actually supervised their visit He thought they were good and asked them to do more work I came home and I wasnt happy The Big Deal was for a set number of hours and my husband wanted them to finish the work so we paid them for extra time We had a crack in the living room ceiling and whatever he mudded it with it didnt blend well with the other texture so it was a real obvious repair as opposed to what we were after Some of the drywall mud had dripped onto the carpet It just wasnt cleaned up after In my mind what I was thinking was a drywaller and drywaller tend to come in on a house that is not finished and they get to be pretty sloppy But this was work being done in a finished home so I was expecting more I was anticipating that after he fixed the crack and textured it we would be painting over it I didnt expect to find a mess on the floor and have to do some clean up My husband thought that they did a reasonable job Not a great job but a reasonable job My husband said they were late but it was justified
5,Kjell did a great job He was able to do work the same day that I called He was prompt efficient and pleasant to work with We will definitely use Kjell in future
5,They were great They were efficient They were very fast
1,I called and emailed several times and he responded once but never followed up and I was never able to schedule anything I ended up exchanging the Deal for another one
5,Full time Servants were wonderful They showed up on time and were amazingly polite The spot in the ceiling was in a very awkard spot and they managed to work it out We have textured walls and they stayed over to make sure the work was dry before applying the texture The finished product was amazing I will use Full Time Servants again for any of our dry wall needs and would recommend them to anyone
5,All work was performed well  on time I have Kjell on my schedule for other handyman repairs
5,Kjell was courteous prompt and efficient Got the job done quickly while finding and implementing lowcost solutions Also eager to show me how to do the repairs myself I plan to have him do more work on my house
5,No more leaks New shower parts and walls look great
1,took my money materials never completed job
5,It was an Angies List Big Deal that I purchased It was great and I would highly recommend him He was very professional very quick and knowledgeable I would absolutely use him again
5,The service went great they were communicative and easy to work with I had a short time frame and they were able to work me in He missed a fine detail I saw a corner of old paint still sticking out and it really should have been removed I dont know why he missed that He even went to the store to and from my work site to pick up some paint for me he did not have to do that so thats really working with me
4,I bought the 59 deal from Angies List for two hours of handyman services After some initial confusion confirming my appointment Kjell came out and asked me for a list of what I wanted done He made sure I got my two hours worth of time out of him
5,Kjell was terrific I would definitely recommend him and will use him for all of the household repairs that may be needed in the future
5,Everything was done correctly and in a very timely manner The fee was more than reasonable
5,I had been told by more than one person that porcelain tile was tricky to drill through without cracking so I decided to hire the work out I needed the work done asap and even though Kjell was scheduled up for the week he was able to accommodate my tight schedule by working the job late in the afternoon The job took about 45 minutes to complete He used a hammer drill to make the holes for the screw anchors He then completed the installation of the shower curtain rod and finished the job
5,Kjell was great and even though we didnt move forward with the job we will use Kjell for our Handyman needs in the future
5,I was very pleased with the quality of the work They cleaned up after themselves and gave me reasonable quotes on some future projects I was thinking of having done
5,Very pleased all around
5,He is awesome
5,Very good
3,The job did not go as anticipated We had to stay on top of the work which initially was rather mediocre We were told that we were too particular since we wanted the tiles to line up  imagine that Also anything negative that happened was the customers fault and not the contractors We will never rehire this contractor or recommend him to any of our friends or associates
5,Richard was fantastic He has excellent communication work ethic and quality of work We are very pleased with the work he did for us and will definitely use him again in the future It was so nice to have this experience with him after having a bad experience with a previous contractor I wish we had found Richard sooner He installed and finished drywall including matching it up with existing plaster which you cant tell was done like you can sometimes due to the difference in thickness of plaster versus drywall He also did some carpentry work and painted
5,Extremely well Richard arrived on time Was very professional Completed the work on time When necessary on design issues he asked me what I wanted or what I had envisioned for the space My home turned out perhaps even more esthetically appealing than I knew it would The new door handles and pulls make me very happy and add joy to my time in my kitchen I would recommend Richard to anyone
5,Perfect On time fair efficient  clean polite and got the job done
5,It went great Richard is excellent at whatever he does Very meticulous and quality conscious Very easy to work with A very Knowledgeable and nice man
5,The Deck reconstruction went smoothly even when at the mercy of February 2019s cold and rainy weather Richard responded to my search promptly He listened to what I wanted prior to beginning the job and made design suggestions as well The job was started within weeks and completed in a timely manner with a few delays due to the weather He hand picked clean new lumber that had minimal knots He hand picked new 6x6 beams even when the lumber store wanted him to use older wood He rounded edges of many of the deck boards for smooth safe design where the deck aligns with our above ground pool He took extra care to leave our property presentable at the end of every work day It was an extreme pleasure working with Richard He is very friendly man as well as extremely talented handyman He has good work ethics and meticulous in his work I would recommend Handyman Unlimited for other handyman jobs
5,Richard and his son as always did a great job They were very professional and pleasant We will hire them again and when we sell our house we will leave his name for the new buyers
5,Richard did a fantastic job Very professional and couldnt have been a nicer guy I would hire him again
5,We were looking for someone who could complete a job that another contractor had not finished and called Richard after seeing a lot of positive reviews One or two good reviews could be from family or friends but many of them is usually a good indicator And that was the case here He was prompt and punctual and did excellent work at reasonable prices Once he was able to start he worked on our job exclusively until it was completed Collaboration with him was both easy and effective As we get older having a trusted group of resources becomes more and more important and we feel that Richard is on that list The next time we need a handyman hell get our first call Highly recommended
5,Reviews of leak repairs must be provisional until proven by a hard rain Nevertheless I am confident that Richard solved our problem and did it in an affordable and thorough manner I had to wait several weeks for him to have an opportunity to do the work but that is no doubt because he is good and has many clients His work was thorough and I was informed of his progress and any additional problems that were discovered while the repair proceeded Not only did he repair the rain damage he traced the problem back to its source and made sure it would not happen again His work was neat professional thorough of the highest quality He knows what he is doing He also documented his work with pictures so that I understood what and why he did certain things Should I need to I will certainly use him again and I highly recommend him to anyone needing general handyman services
5,Far exceeded our expectations Richard remodeled our downstairs walkout basement into a lovely rentable studio apartment with a kitchen and full bath He created a beautiful living bedroom kitchen and bath area from a large open space We couldnt be happier with the quality of work he does
5,Richard did a wonderful job on these tasks He was very professional and personable We plan to use him again for some larger outside tasks as soon as weather permits Highly recommend
5,Richard did a great job He arrived on time got right to work and even returned unused lumber for me so I could get a refund for it I would absolutely hire him again
5,Excellent Richard has done many jobs for us over the years including painting the house He is creative knowledgeable and completely trustworthy and his work is always of high quality
5,We had previously hired someone to remove popcorn ceiling and paint They removed it but along the way damaged the sheet rock and said we needed certain areas that were a problem repaired by someone else We hired Handyman Unlimited and they were incredible The ceiling looks like glass thats been painted We were in awe to see how it made a difference Jenny also suggested we update the crown holding and that was perfect We ask for some custom work also a cabinet area built above what use to be a closet Part of the closet now houses our refrigerator we wanted a space beside it to be a pantry Jenny made us a pantry exactly like we wanted with a very finished look We wanted a pocket door removed and Jenny suggested we widen the opening at the same time great idea She and Jason do not skip to a faster easier way they do everything 120
5,Perfectexcellent work Reliable honest extremely knowledgable and trustworthy Could not ask for a better handyman
5,All the work took 7 days Richard is a craftsman at his work He is very knowledgeable in all aspects of home repair He also gave us ideas on things we can do to help maintain our home
5,Perfectly Couldnt have asked for anything better
5,Mr Byers was very responsive listened to what I asked for and was on time every day His professionalism was only out done by the quality of his work From now on if I need something done I will call him
5,He did a great job It was not an easy job as it entailed a lot of little jobs ie plumbing demolition reconstruction wiring and rewiring tiling etc He did not contract out any job He and his son did it all We would definitely hire him again In fact we plan to use him for another remodel job He is very personable and definitely knows his craft
5,Richard and his son did a great job we love the new bathroom and have had many compliments on it i would definitely hire him again and would highly recommend him
5,They arrived on time They were friendly and professional Reasonably priced Look forward to working with them again
1,I called got answering machine saying my call was important to them and they would call back They never called back
5,Handyman Unlimited Richard remodeled our entire basement This included installing drywall trim painting demo bathroom rearranged plumbing for vanity  commode  installed tile  flooring He was prompt professional  exhibited quality work He cleaned up each day so that we had as least amount of debris as possible He gave some really good suggestions on things we were undecided about Also after he finished the job he came back to repair some wall damages caused by a granite installer We would definitely recommend Richard to others

5,GREAT Richard evaluated and solved a problem for us He cleaned up behind himself both times he was here That is the mark of a good workman
5,They painted the entire door and when they were finished it looks new I cant say enough about how pleased I am at the work done and the price was very reasonable Thank you Richard and son You saved me so much money by not having to replace the entire door I will definitely ask Richard to do more jobs as they arise

5,Richard was able to do the job with very short notice He was accessible and responsive Very friendly and professional Did the job quickly and cleaned up afterwards Very good quality job Will definitely contact again for future jobs
5,The living room has a tongue and groove wood ceiling Its vaulted and angled with no attic above it I wanted ceiling fans and recessed lighting installed but a couple electricians who came out told me the job was impossible Finally I found an electrician who came up with a strategy to install the fans and lighting so that the wiring was all tucked up underneath the ceiling  no ugly wire molding But the work involved carpentry skills Paul Murrell my electrician and Richard devised a plan that required making a cut along the grooves in order to remove a board He called Richard Byers to assist him It was a complex job that no one else was willing to tackle Together Richard and Paul managed to do all the work in one day Their work was meticulous You cant tell which wood board was cut they stained the edge to match the existing ceiling so its invisible It looks as if the house was designed and built with the fans and lighting The price was more than fair for the amount of work involved Im so impressed and happy with the final result
5,Richard is incredibly efficient and exacting Other reviews say meticulous and I agree At the end of every day Richard was sure to clean up and leave all areas neat He allowed the kitchen to be as useable as possible He made great recommendations and suggestions Before adding molding to the ceiling he had to remove 27 yr old wallpaper border He did this easily and seemed to have the molding up in no time I had some very plain unfinishedlooking areas on cabinets and walls that he enhanced with molding as well In order to install the backsplash I wanted he had to take out a cabinet above the microwave so he did this raised the microwave and made a box for a future wine rack above the microwave with leftover room He installed new backsplashes beautifully Some of the cabinet doors were a bit crooked and the counters were not level He fixed them as well Richard and an electrician friend of his installed canned lighting in the ceiling added pendant lights and changed out the chandelier They also installed under counter lighting and moved outlets for more convenience Incidentally they also installed a ceiling fan in a bedroom Richard has also done many other jobs for me Recently he installed a hot tub on my deck replaced rotten boards painted the deck and secured it underneath for the weight of the tub He installed new railings as well Richard power washed the area including my deck cushions Richard is as noninvasive as possible by being as quiet as the job allows and by being courteous in manner and approach He is polite wellspoken and seems to enjoy challenging jobs He is not passive in his thinking but rather he is always problemsolving and engaged He wants the customer to be happy with the job he has done He is happy when he can walk away knowing his customer is satisfiedwho wouldnt want someone like him working for them Richard has family members who can help him when the job calls for more than one person  such as installing a hot tub His daughter is a handywoman by profession and he has sons who help him at times
5,He did great work and was very friendly
5,Once again Richard did a perfect job as requested  and then some He even provided some materials so I didnt need to buy extra This is the third time he has done work for me and he has always been great He is the best handyman I have ever hired
5,Great on time great quality very professional
5,Beautiful work Im very happy with it Thank you Richard 
5,Richard is absolutely METICULOUS He arrived daily at the time he said he would He laid tarps from our front door all the way to the master bathroom so he could come and go without getting dirt into the house He removed the tile from our shower and showed us exactly what the problem was that caused the leak and explained what needed to be done to fix it It was very apparent that he is a master plumbercarpenterhandyman He gave suggestions on what kind of tile to look for and how to match it to the original tile as best as possible The job required that the tile be removed from the entire shower from waist heightdown Richard jackhammered everything out all the way to the subfloor and showed us what was happening to cause the leak He removed all of the rottingmolded wood and replaced everything in between the floors He used the highest quality materials and explained to us every step and why he was doing it He reworked the drain that was not draining properly The previous installers had used ROOFING NAILS to nail down the cement board with no glue Richard explained to us that a special type of screw was supposed to be used WITH a special kind of glue to keep the screws from coming out and cracking the grout when the floor expands and contracts due to temperature changes He showed us numerous other things that had been done incorrectly and showed us how he was addressing each issue At the end of each day Richard cleaned and shop vacuumed his way out of the bathroom all the way to the front door and left virtually no trace that he had been there Richard came back at the end of the job and sealed the tile and grout He was kind courteous and well spoken Our shower looks even better than it did when it was first renovated and I know it will last a lifetime due the meticulous work ethic of this handyman This was the most positive experience we have ever had with a home maintenance person It was worth every penny to have this peace of mind Richard is awesome and we highly recommend him Jeff and Kathy Holden
5,I called the cell telephone number while Richard was out of town He returned my call promptly We discussed what services I needed at my homeWhen he returned to Phoenix we made an appointment for him to give me an estimate We discussed the work needed and Richard came back the next morning to do the job it took less than an hour it was done quickly and professionally Richard is personable I would use his services again
5,We did not use this provider however Handyman Unlimited was very professional and prompt in giving a bid on services We would definitely use them in the future
5,The experience was excellent the best we have had the work was on time on budget with done with great care and neatness We had been referred to Richard by a friend and he was as advertised We highly recommend Richard and have asked him to bid on another project and are looking forward to working with him in the future
5,You need to know that Richard is WONDERFUL He remodeled our master bathroom in three weeks never missing a day of work there always giving it his best effort always pleasant and kind He gave us great advice concerning elements of the renovation and took pride in every element of his work The end result is an absolutely beautiful brand new bathroom that we will enjoy for years and we are so thankful that we chose Richard to be the one to remodel it
5,You just cannot go wrong with Richard and his daughter Period He was out to our home quickly to examine the work to be done Courteous pleasant neat very focused and meticulous Condition of his truck and work trailer bespoke professionalism Takes great pride in his work More than a handyman he is a craftsman He was prompt every day He kept a very clean worksite and took great care to ensure that he did not damage the home interior in any way He welcomed questions no matter how dumb and he was extremely patient in explaining his procedures as he went along The work took four days and during that time I found additional honeydo items that were not on the original agenda Richard cheerfully added those jobs without any qualms whatsoever He was very careful to ensure that he closed doors as our cat is an indoors cat with no front claws The match between the color of paint and the existing siding was excellent There were several other items needing attention at a later date and Richard was freely providing advice on what I could do about them or what he would do if I hired him again We have had our home for 17 years Ive had many repairsupgrades done to the structure and appliances and HVAC While Ive dealt with some exceptional folks providing those services Richard is at the top of the list I expect to pay a higher price for top quality that lasts with Richard I received top quality AND a very reasonable price You simply cannot go wrong with this serviceI already have another list for Handyman Unlimited And I have that peace of mind knowing that whatever happens in the future I do not have to wade through the yellow pages or Angies List or wordofmouth to find someone to handle the work With complete confidence Ill just give Richard a call
5,Everything we discussed was addressed professionally
5,Richard is nonstop and I really like the way he does work he is very clean and efficient and I wouldnt use anyone else
5,It went wonderfully He is like full blast all the time he never slows down or takes breaks Hes amazing guy The pricing is good He is incredibly nice an allaround good guy He is very polite He doesnt waste any time and hes extremely knowledgeable
3,We did not get past the initial phone call because he said he was too busy and booked until summer and referred us to his daughter He really seemed more interested in getting business for his daughter than anything else We chose not to call her because she is not on Angies List and we decided to call someone else
5,Richard is an absolute professional and joy to work with He is utmost of meticulous very detail focused and wants his work to be perfect Which it is I am very particular about how I want things done and Richard is more particular than I am which allowed me to relax about the entire project We needed some painting done in addition to the tile work which we thought had been hired out to another contractor that fell through We asked if Richard if he could complete the work though he was scheduled for another job he said he would make sure it would be completed either by him or his daughter Jenny Jenny came and evaluated the project and gave us a quote that we felt was reasonable and she started the next day Both Jenny and Richards work is flawless We have other projects we would like to consider for the future and we will definitely call on them to complete Thank you
5,Richard Byers worked in our home almost every day for several weeks His daughter asisted him routinely during this time They were very prompt and professional and extremely nice people who were very easy to work with We were completely comfortable during the entire process having them in our home alone We were pleasantly surprised how clean their work was especially involving the replacement of the popcorn ceiling There was almost no dust involved Their painting work was excellent on ceilings and walls Richard did an excellent job on the bathrooms and we are very pleased with the tile work in all areas He is very skilled in renovation work One of the most important things to us was that virtually all work was done by Richard and his daughter so we did not have to worry about dealing with a lot of different workersservice providers As time went on they became more like friends than just a service provider Both my wife and I felt very comfortable asking any questions requesting changes in the work etc and Richard was always polite and accomodating He never answered our questions or requests in a condescending manner which is something we have experienced with other service providers in the past In summary we would recommend Handyman Unlimited to anyone needing this type of work and we had an excellent experience We plan to use Handyman Unlimited again in the near future for additional work on our house
4,No work was commissioned since we needed the work done immediately not in six months
4,The owner of Handyman Unlimited was busy doing other jobs and could not come when I called He mentioned that he had taught his daughter Jenny who works with him and she could do job We agreed to have her call me and I hired her He taught her well Jenny did a very good job
5,Jenny came out and gave us an estimate for the work and then came back the next day and did the initial work She returned once the grout had dried to finish the job and it looks great
5,Richard called before he came he was punctual and he completed the work easily He clarified what he was going to do before he started He has worked for me several times over the past five years on both small and large punch lists and has always been professional He says that he tries to complete work on others homes as he would want his to be done He is very neat and he cleans up at the end of the day so that one would never know he had been there except that the work done looks exceptional He is worth the wait that sometimes occurs because he is so busy When he is actually working on a home the homeowner would never know that he is busy because he takes his time to accomplish the job in the best manner possible I highly recommend Richard Byers You will not be disappointed
1,See the details above in the What did the provider do section
3,He arrived promptly after we made initial contact He gave us a quote  an estimate for cost He also told us when the work would be done However he did not show up  when we called he told us he was very busy  would have to delay our job It was not a good experience We would rather pay more for a repair  get the job done than to get the run around from a contractor It makes us hesitant to find another repair person through your service
5,Richard and his helper daughter jenny was great Did the work on time made the drogues we discussed repaired all was focused on the job and finished all that was needed He went beyond above
5,The worked was thoroughly completed and we are very happy with the results
5,RIchard quoted labor only for me so that I could purchase the materials I wanted I had lots of questions about the projects which he answered patiently and thoroughly Since I could not be at the house I left him a key He arrived when he said he would did a great job with all projects and cleaned up after himself He also gave me some great tips on projects Im doing myself I hope to get him to do more work for me soon Very pleased
5,We were thrilled with the work performed Richard had integrity was prompt and courteous He cleaned up everyday of the job He ensured that sealants dried properly before laying tiles on them He made minor repairs throughout the house for us so quickly and efficiently He insisted on completing the work before receiving any pay My husband was a licensed contractor in the past and he loved everything Richard did We are very confident that the job is now done right I will definitely hire him again in the future Thank you Angies List for this referral
5,Richard knows his business He created an opening in the wall between my kitchen and living room that looks as though it has always been there His carpentry and painting cannot be beaten and he is wellmannered and wellspoken He was not bothered by my curious beagle and acknowledged him each time he came in I was pleased with his professionalism He always answered my questions about his process and progress kindly I recommend his work highly
5,Richard has performed many jobs for me for the past four years He has cut down trees repaired my deckput new railings around my deck built a raised garden bed painted the trim on my house and replaced rotten wood where necessary He has also done maintenance on outside tools and he has power washed the house several times He has replaced gutters that were chewed by squirrels and he has cleaned my gutters twice a year He helped me design a front porch railing that was elaborate and unique and then he built it Inside Richard has worked on my bathrooms by changing the floors to tile replaced toilets and built frames for around my mirrors He added chair railing and has done some minor electrical work He also repaired my indoor window shutters No job seems too big or too small for him He is extremely efficient and thorough and he cleans up so that you would never know he has been hereHe completes work that would take other handymen a week in half that time Everything is done with expertise Richards daughter occasionally helps and she is also very professional I have no qualms about leaving him in my home and I usually just give him a key that he keeps until the job is done I trust him completely
5,Richard was very responsive and did a great job Timely with his estimate and with the work The refinishing was superior to the previous work done The cleaning and washing were very well done He also fixed other things that came up during the work like the leak I will certainly use him again and have recommended him to friends
5,Richard really helped us out of a jam this week when another drywall contractor who had given us the runaround for a week finally fell through completely With new kitchen countertops on order and with a short window until their install date Richard was able to step in on short notice and install drywall in our kitchen He estimated a very fair price for the job showed up when he said he would was obviously knowledgeable and experienced as he explained the steps in the process He used the correct materials for a wet area thinking of details that we had not previously considered and worked quickly and efficiently He did a great job and left the kitchen neat and tidy every day which is no small chore when working with drywall We are so grateful for his help on this project and would definitely work with him again
5,We were redoing our kitchen and I was serving as the General Contractor I was looking for a painter to remove the popcorn ceiling and repair drywall where a pantry was removed I quickly learned that Richard could do everything and so I added lots of extra jobs to his list He was dependable and very very thorough Whatever he did he did very well and with professionalism He gave suggestions and I felt like he was an expert in his field He was very clean and neat and left the house having cleaned up whatever mess was made I felt very comfortable leaving the house and not feeling I had to supervise One day I called him from Sears to ask about the kind of ice maker line to purchase After he installed the dishwasher he ran a cycle to make sure there were no leaks and the same with the faucet and icemaker I will definitely use him again In fact I am waiting on a quote for some outdoor repairs
3,This was a case where I let myself get drawn in by all the positive hype I read about some of Richards previous jobs and trusted him because of that I did not get him to break down individually the costs for the 4 different jobs I needed done but accepted a total estimate When I decided to remove the 2 remaining jobs after he had finished the first 2 he only reduced his final invoice slightly from his original bid on the 4 jobs I didnt argue as I was the one who failed to get him to break done the jobs individually by cost but 120hour for pressure washing and wall paper removalcome on man Dont make the mistake I made get a separate estimate for every single job you have Richard do and then get someone else to give you an estimate and I bet it will be a lot cheaper for the same average quality
5,This was a great experience Richard called me when he arrived at my home When I arrived he had already started on the project He was able to salvage some of the railings and replace many of the others He raised the canopy level on the porch by an inch He took the time to explain that some of the replacement pieces need to dry before they could be repainted He remained until he was sure that I understood the next steps When he left you couldnt tell he was there  other than the brilliant woodwork done on the porch He IS my go to Handyman  period
5,Excellent Could not have gone better Richard was prompt and considerate in his timing and communications He stuck to his cost estimate and time frame My one hesitation in recommending Richard is that he might get so busy wed have a hard time getting him back to do more stuff Hes that good
5,Did not get very far but my experience with Richard was definately a good one I can only hope that he will be available when I revist the projects

5,This was my second time using Handyman Unlimited Richard Byers services I was as pleased this time as I was the first time both in the quality of work and the overall cost Both times I have used Richards services his daughter assisted him This time his daughter assisted mostly with painting and did an excellent job Richard was always on time professional attentive to details and delivered a quality product I especially liked the fact that Richard would make suggestions on the work I needed to have done but not in a pushy way I appreciated his recommendations as he has been doing this type of work for years I will definitely call on Richard for any future needs In fact I am having new frontback entry doors installed on Monday 61112 Richard has already agreed to paint both doors after they are installed I will contact him on Tuesday 61112 to determine a dateI also have plans this year to paint the interior of my house I will definitely contact Richard when I get ready to do that One last comment I do feral cat rescue and have several cats in my house as well as a colony of cats outside This is a passion of mine and the cats inside the house absolutely cannot go outside Richard was very sensitive to this and understands that any service he performs such as the upcoming painting of the interior of my house will most likely have to be done in phases I have to secure the inside cats in 2 different rooms while painting is being done in the other rooms I very much appreciate his sensitivity to my special needs
5,He also cuts our azalea bushes fixes our appliances and does anything else we need He is very good I give him an A overall
5,Absolutely awesome Richard and his daughter were wonderful to work with The remodel started thee weeks ago every day I was amazed at the transformation The baths were even cleaned at the end They asked my input on everything they did The even repainted areas when I was not pleased with MY paint choice Richard even hung shades at no extra cost His workmanship is superior I knew he was the one to choose and am very happy I have already recommended him to coworkers
5,Richard is an amazing workman He leaves no detail undone He cleans up every day He was here about 15 days to complete this job I found him on Angies List joining was best thing I did My words can not adequately describe all the work he did and the beautiful wonderful bathroom I now have I am handicapped and I can now  unassisted use my bathroomshower alone Everything that I need for my shower is done grab bars in wall shelf no lip on floor entry to shower  floor slopes into shower basin  Richard did so much more than I am able to describe My finished project is everything I asked for and more
5,Professional and courteous fair estimate prompt and professional  very good quality work highly recommended would call again
5,He did more than I could even of asked him to do I even gave him an extra 1000 on top of what he charged All of his work is amazing He is honest and happy all the time I wish we had more people like him in our area
5,Very professional and nice
5,Perfect True professional A
5,All work was completed on time Great attention to detail and getting everything just right Outstanding job Estimate was inline with the actual cost I have and would recommend this business
5,Richard was very pleasant courteous professional and knowledgable He showed up on time every day and was very meticulous about the detail of his work while doing his best to cause a minimal disturbance to the household He cleaned up everyday and gave me routine progress reports and happily answered my questions and offered advice On top of all of this his price was very competetive and unlike most contractors he provided an accurate estimate within a few days time This experience is the very reason my family joined Angies List We researched about five different companiespeople about the work based on reviews and ended up with fantastic work done at a very good price I highly recommend Richard and Handyman Unlimited
5,This company has worked for us a total of 3 times The 1st time I found the company on Angies List and had them construct a handicap ramp for my husband who had just had a serious accident I specified that I wanted the ramp to be removable after my husbands recovery Because I needed the ramp quickly they gave this job top priority and got it done right away Richard did a marvelous job and came back 9 months later to take it down when we needed him to Next I asked for an estimate to have a complete bathroom overall I wanted a 1960s long narrow bath to be gutted and become handicap accessible and I wanted a walk in shower The completed job is beautiful and the price was excellent There was a large amount of tiling involved shower walls decorative trim and a shower insert as well as the entire floor Richard is very precise he makes sure he gets it right He had never done the type of sloped floor we needed in the shower and he did considerable research to do it correctly that part had me nervous because if the slope isnt correct there would be major problems He did it perfect I also appreciated how they cleaned up after themselves every single day On his 3rd visit in the spring of this year we had several small jobs done fixing a door taking down the ramp and storing it etc If you are in a hurry for a job to get done be cautious it WILL get done and done right but maybe not on your time schedule We will continue to call this company for other jobs
5,Richard came over to fix a leak Thought he had it fixed but it still leaked He came back a second time found the problem and fixed it He then came over when we had a big rain to make sure it was not leaking He only charged his original fee Richard goes beyond what you would expect from a repair person He is very professional I highly recommend him Ben Miller
5,Services performed as agreed upon in a timely  professional manner
5,Very meticulous makes everything right and I loved all of it Completed it like it had never never been harmed Daughter does painting and it was excellent
4,Richard was kind enough to go beyond his usual service area to give me an estimate on a variety of home repairs He made me aware of a 40 fee at the time we first spoke He went to the property and promptly provided me with a verbal quote of the estimate of his work via telephone However he did not send me a written detailed listing While I appreciated his punctual response I found the quote too high and lacking in specifics Therefore I did not choose to contract him to perform the work
5,Excellent excellent job Good work guys
5,He is very prompt and polite He is honest and dresses neat and clean He does not waste any time He will go and purchase supplies and come back and do the work and he is fast
5,Richard was prompt in getting back to me with the initial contact and then with the estimate The estimate was provided on 61911 and the work began the following day on Monday 62011 My punch list included both interior and exterior jobs Richard was leaving for a trip on 62011 and had informed me that his 2 adult children who work with him would perform the exterior tasks for me on Monday 62011 His son called me first thing Monday morning and established a start time and they showed up right on time They were both very pleasant and professional They began work about 930 am and finished around 330 pm the same day I was very pleased with the work they did the time it took them to complete the work and the cost As soon as Richard returns from his trip he will contact me to setup a time to complete the interior jobs we discussed I will submit a separate report when that work is completed So far I can say that I would and will use this service again in the future
5,Richard was great He provided a very detailed estimate and did the work exactly as he said he would In fact in many cases he went above and beyond the estimate and did work that was not specified just because he saw that it needed to be done He was on the job 100 of the time which was a plus for us when selecting him His adult children work with him so they have the same work ethic as him Have to say it took a few days longer than some of the bigger paint companies but his scope of work is much greater and the quality and attention to detail was well worth the wait
5,The work was professional and detail oriented and it was not an easy job on an older house to make everything fit
5,Exchanged calls gave an estimate for the above As Richard was doing the work I tried to stay out of the way but wanted to see what he was doing and how he was doing the work and to see the damage behind the obvious exterior damage He and his son were very patient covered the work in detail gave their opinion on what needed to be done and the cost of additional work if we wanted it done Part of the problem was my delay in calling in the first place as the professionals we have called before Angies list werent At least two are out of business but onward we go Delay and the problems gets worse I believe the problems addressed above have been fixed and the work is first rate Found one additional nail in the driveway but the site was left very clean Have other jobs to be done and we will give Richard the first call Great Value
5,Richard did an outstanding job He can repair anything He repaired a door that others said could not be repaired He is a true craftsman If you want the job done right at a fair cost hes your man
5,Very well We used his services before and knew what to expect Richard is a very nice person to deal with
5,Richard came out to look at the job exactly when he said he would and called within the day with the estimate excellent workmanship gave helpful suggestions for the design and finished the work quickly knowing that we had a time issue The ramp was completed in one day We were thoroughly pleased with the project and would definitely use his company again
5,The experience was wonderful He came out and listened to everything that I was wanting He gave some really good helpful tips He listened patiently and was right on time Everything was wonderful but I hadnt budgeted for the 1000 I only had budgeted 700 so I am doing a portion of the work myself and then I am definitely going to give him a call back to come and finish up I really had a lot of confidence in what he was telling me The estimate he gave was totally in line
5,Everything went as planned The job took the estimated time The labor estimate was very close to final price and I thought it was a fair price The materials that The Handyman purchased seemed somewhat high I should have asked for receipts I would say the work was exceptional The Handyman pays a lot of attention to detail I would call him again
5,Glad I found Richard This was a project that I thought I might be able to do myself I am certainly glad I did not take it on After Richard tore into the project we found electrial outlets had to be moved heating ducts had to be moved and the door opening had to be cut just right There is no way I could have done it Richard did a first class job He did the construction electrical pumbing everything He cleaned up each day He was right on with his quote for the job I would highly recommend this company
5,He is fantastic Others in the know who have seen his work have agreed that his craftsmanship is superb He is reliable communicative upfront and very talented at what he does
5,They did an excellent job and we were very pleased with the service The thing I like most about this contractors is that he can do everything He did so much work and it is all great He was here a lot and the whole time he was pleasant to have around I would recommend him based on the quality of his work and his prices are reasonable as well
5,OVER THE YEARS I HAVE USED THIS COMPANY FOR ALL MY HANDYMAN NEEDS THEY DO EVERYTHING FOR ME I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISSATISFIED WITH THEIR WORK THEY DO A GREAT JOB
5,Very nice work

5,Our 30 year old forced air furnace was costly to run and not efficient From estimate to installation and a follow up visit to explain the finer points of our system everyone was courteous hardworking and reliable We use Williamsons for service for all our heating and cooling needs They are highly recommended
5,The service was excellent came the next day at the right time knew the problem and fixed it immediately exterior wiring issue that was repaired and got fixed
5,Rob the owner was very polite and honest  answered all my questions and concerns His crew Danielmikeand Walter right on time very professional and outgoingevery step of the way was explained They went above and beyond kept everything cleaned no messes  I overall would recommend Williamsons heating  cooling to anyone thats looking for an amazing honest local company and his team of wonderful employeesIf u want the job done right the first time then Williamsons heating  cooling Thank you team
5,Williamsons installed the first HVAC system in my house in 1996 I got 23 years of operation out of it with very few problems Williamsons did all of the yearly service and the minor repairs that were invariably needed due to the age of the system I hired them to replace the system and to replace the ducting in my house They handled the complete transaction from the initial inspection and estimate through the installation and the followup very professionally The installation was done with a minimum of disruption and done very diligently The crew was courteous and professional They took care to protect my floors and walls and cleaned up at the end of every day During the replacement of the ducting in my attic which is not a fun thing to do they accidentally caused some damage to my house After the installation was completed they immediately followedup with the repair of the damage and provided a contract letter to indicate that if any other latent damage is discovered they will accept responsibility and repair I could not have asked for better service throughout the whole process I have a long history with Williamsons and have always been completely satisfied with their service They are honest and forthright and do excellent work I have always found their prices to be reasonable They may be a little more expensive than some other HVAC contractors but the quality of their systems and their service is worth the cost I highly recommend them
5,Absolutely superb response and service Now our goto company for HVAC and electric needs Outside AC unit malfunctioned Friday night Called 1st thing Sat morning 8ish received call within an hour for expected arrival time noon tech Dave called and arrived a little before noon diagnosed problem and buttoned up unit within 45 min Reasonable labor rates given a weekend overtime situation in 100 degree weather Professional courteous extremely knowledgeable and personable to boot
5,The people at Williamson are outstanding from the office person to the installers We have never had any service comparable to the service by the Williamson crew They were fantastic and very professional in every aspect The four installed Quincy Chris Rene and Devon were great super attitude very respectful of our property did a great installvery professional It has been one week today since the install and all seems to going well We are very pleased with Williamsons and would highly recommend them
5,Work was done well and cleaned up as they worked
5,We called Williamsons on a Saturday morning and Walter service technician came out that day Problem diagnosed and the system back in operation that day A followup visit today made all the necessary adjustments to make sure the system runs smooth and healthy through the rest of the summer So  initial install  great job service call  great job
5,Repair was done quickly and efficiently
5,I needed to have the work done in the spring because the wiring was also ruined and it controlled my swamp coolers as well The technicians checked that the furnace worked as did I but I didnt really use it until more than six months later It didnt seem to be working as well as I hoped so I called Williamsons who promptly scheduled the service manager to come out He looked at the furnace and told me that it was missing a part to hold the filter and further that it had not been sealed off properly I was astounded at his honesty although I shouldnt have been because all of my interactions with this company have been extremely positive unlike virtually every other heating and cooling company I have ever had He also diagnosed and fixed a squealing noise that sometimes appeared when the furnace was running furniture partially blocking a duct They had to order the part and their excellent technician Walter came out installed it and sealed off the bottom of the furnace which required climbing into a very tiny space He did a fantastic job
5,My existing air conditioning unit was old noisy and used R22 refrigerant which was becoming very expensive to acquire I decided to update the AC and furnace ahead of an outage in the worst of summer I put out for three bids Williamsons was the most professional of the three when it came to evaluating the job and providing the bid The proposal was clear and concise and the bottomline number quoted was exactly what I ended up paying There were no hidden fees or surprise extra charges The installation was performed across the span of two days which means that it was properly scheduled and not rushed given the amount of work to be done a oneday install is a questionable proposition The two installers  Josh and Randall  were professional courteous and very hardworking young men Their attention to detail was very good The job is now complete Today was when the owner of Williamsons came out to do a final postinstall inspection of the work to make certain all was done properly The professional nature of the dealings with Williamsons made the entire experience a positive one In an industry with many who seek to make a quick dollar and leave I found the opposite to be true with Williamsons  they strike me as straightup professional business people That is a very good thing
5,They knew exactly what was wrong and fixed it They cleaned the unit completely and explained to me everything they were doing They diagnosed the problem and told me what part it needed and how much it would cost It went just like they said Very nice service repairman I promised to hire them to come and service my air conditioner compressor in March
5,Excellent Very good follow up service
2,Poorly The initial appointment was great The salesman showed up and appeared to be very professional and knowledgeable I knew they would be finalists based on reputation and the quality of the initial consult The problem is that I never received the quote despite letting them know that I wanted to start the work within a week or two it was very hot outside still I called back after two weeks and was told that I would receive my quote that day Two weeks later I went with a competitor and ended up replacing both heat pumps Two months later Im still not in receipt of a quote
5,They showed up on time and did a great job We have used them several times and they are always there when they say theyre going to be and always do a good job They are very knowledgeable and informative and I would and have highly recommended their services to others
5,We had previously called another heating company who spent over an hour trying to diagnose the problem They finally came back with an estimate of over 1000 for repair but strongly recommended a new furnace We then called Williamson based primarily on their Angies List rating and the experience was great They came out immediately diagnosed the problem within 15 minutes had the part in stock and installed it the next morning Great service and I would recommend them highly
5,I decided I wanted an installer that had been approved for the Tucson Electric Power TEP rebate program This is a wonderful way to ensure that you are getting a top notch installation which is critical for a system to work at peak performance Hence I checked the TEP website and got a list of authorized dealers I then crossed referenced those dealers with the Angies List top contractors and selected three to bid on the job Needless to say I selected Williamsons Williamsons lived up to their reviews Initially Wally came to test my old system for the TEP rebate After filling up the condenser with refrigerant the system tested OK for the maximum rebate  850 Williamsons also gave me an Angies List discount and a discount for a cash payment which made their price the best of all the bids With the refrigerant added the system limped along until the following week when Wally returned with an assistant to do the job They easily handled a couple of minor glitches and completed the job as promised with no evidence except wonderful AC that they had even been there TEP is sending an inspector next week to confirm that the job was done as they specified for maximum efficiency I am completely comfortable that I received the best possible installation and will have a worry free AC and heating system I highly recommend Williamsons and the TEP program
5,I have had Williamsons working on my AC Heating unit for about six years and knew that eventually it would have to be replaced and that time came this August Over the years I developed a trust in their expertise as their service calls were always on time and very professional Dave came out on 27 July and told me that it is time to start thinking of replacement as the one of the coils is shot and is leaking Freon badly 4 12 pounds in the last two months I asked Dave to work up a proposal for me and I had it the next day I also got three other proposals Williamsons proposal was not the lowest but within 20000 of the lowest so I decided to go with Williamsons because of the trust factor knowing that they would handle this promptly and in a professional manner Made my decision on 30 Jul and signed the contracts They even included a free two year maintenance plan at the contract signing The unit had to be ordered and was scheduled to be installed on 10 Aug The wait was not an issue since my current unit was working and Dave would keep it going at no cost to me until the new unit is installed On 10 Aug John Paul and Devon arrived at 930 as promised and removed the old rooftop unit and installed the new unit explained the operation of the new unit answered all my questions and cleaned up the work site and were gone by 1245 It could not have gone better John Paul and Devon were very knowledgeable and very professional not only in the way they did their work but the way they conducted themselves in their interaction with me and my wife In fact  over the years with Williamsons every technician that came out to work on my AC unit was very professional in their work but also treated me the customer with respect That is important to any customer Their entire staff is professional and easy to talk with All in all I would definitely hire them again and highly recommend Williamsons to anyone
5,The staff at Williamson is a great group of people to install and maintain your AC equipment We had a defect in one of our units Williamsons staff ordered the part and responded the day the part arrived I cannot recommend them enough
5,What a pleasure it was to work with this company They came out quickly to provide an estimate gave me estimates on two options either they provide the heat pump system or I do and did the work within the next few days Every person I talked to was pleasant and professional Both the estimator and the installers arrived when they said they would The installers explained what they would be doing and then did it including taking away two old nonfunctional units They cleaned up and before they left showed me how to operate the system For years I have been trying to find a heating and cooling company like Williamsons Unlike all the other companies I have used this was a positive experience from start to finish I highly recommend them and will use them for all my heating and cooling needs
5,On 203 2015 Mr John Paul Kammeyer came to our house for an estimate and he arrived on time He took all the necessary measurements answered with patience and knowledge to our many many questions and discussed with us in detail the equipment options the installation the warranties the TEP program and answered every question we had and more After two days he emailed the estimate followed by a hard copy in the mail Of course after we got the estimate we realized that we had many more questions which he addressed entirely during our phone conversations What I want to emphasize is his work ethic professionalism and a deep deep knowleadge of the equipment functionality and the science behind all of this He is a very honest individual warm willing to help and he encouraged us to call him each time we have a question There is nothing fake about him and what he says and promisees it is exactly what is going to happen He had never tried to deceive or push us On 2102015 after we had a clear picture of what we want and the cost involved we went to the office and signed the contract Everyone at the office was very courteous and helpful The work was scheduled for 2162015 The crew of four people arrived on time and split because each person had a specific designated job to do The installation team was led by Devon who is a very knowledgeable and competent person The next day a crew of only two people was necessary to continue and again they showed up on time They once more worked the whole day toward finishing the job During the installation Mr Kammeyer came by to observe the progress and intervene if it were necessary The job was finished on 2182015 and the work was clean very detailed and proficient Devon explained how each equipment functions gave us the manuals instructed us in programming the thermostat and of course answered many of our questions Him and his team were very professional courteous and hard workers After the final test was performed and sent to TEP Devon was able to tell us that TEP approved 85000 Williamsons Heating and Cooling deducted this amount from the final price listed above before billing us On 2252015 Mr Kammeyer came for a final inspection and to address any additional questions or concerns we might had We are extremely pleased with our choice of contractor and the work theyve done We recommend Williamsons Heating and Cooling to anyone who wants a trustworthy qualified contractor
5,We first hired Williamsons Heating and Cooling to take care of our HVAC when we purchased our house in 2000 We had two air conditioners and two furnaces the original systems from when the house was built in 1991 and Dave did a great job of keeping them both running well despite their age We decided to replace them with energy efficient units to reduce our monthly costs as well as take advantage of TEP rebates Williamsons did a fantastic job all around from explaining the benefits of upgrading to testing and installing the systems to getting us the highest rebates possible Devon and his crew were excellent very easy to work with and the new systems look spotless  they did a lot of extra cleanup of both areas before installing the equipment We highly recommend Williamsons Heating and Cooling  its a great company to work with
5,I am totally satisfied with the work performed by Williamsons Heating  Cooling John arrived on time and informed me of the process involved before he began The job from starttofinish was problem free I really trust this company When i make the switch to AC I will be giving them a call
5,Very thorough He took his time in the inspection He found that the tenants from h had shoved newspaper in the heating vent He told us where we could buy filters We bought an annual system wellness contract
5,I first started out doing research on which brand of splittype AC I wanted then from Mitsubishis web site I found which certified providers they had here in Tucson From there I went straight to Angies List and reviewed what the members had to say about each Based on that read I selected Williamsons Selling the system was not needed as I knew what I wanted I just wanted to discuss the system and get a quote before I hired them for the job John Paul was prompt and very professional The information he provided and his nonpushy approach was enough for me to sign up to get it done which just happened to be the very next day Wally and Bill showed up around 10 am and wrapped up around 430 pm They were both very professional and down right nice guys I directed them to the rooms that the units were to go in and they took it from there It was clear that this wasnt their 1st rodeo as far as I could tell they had a game plan and pulled it off without any hiccups Once completed they even painted the conduit covers with paint I had left over They cleaned up everything and even washed the windows other than having a great new system installed one would never even know they were here Wally and Bill spoke very highly of Williamsons as a company which was great to hear they are a credit to Williamsons and I expect Ill be adding another splittype AC to our master br in the months ahead and Williansons will get the call They even did a check on my main AC system while they were here I am very pleased One last thing I was just kidding about them washing my windows Cheers
5,We have 2 AC units on our house The old units had been in place about 13 years We were dreading the day the units needed to be replaced and had been nursing them along the past 3 years replacing parts here and there hobbling by It became evident it was time to replace them when both units ceased within a few days of each otherI had 3 companies come out to bid We wanted someone withthe right combination of experience and equipment We had done some research of AC brands and liked all wed found about American Standard In the end we went with Williamsons Heating  Cooling I found them on Angies List and had no prior affiliation All the folks at Williamsons are very professional knowledgeable and friendly  and they were able to qualify us for TEP rebates most other companies cannot get through the CheckMe program Honestly their prices BEFORE rebates were very competitive Robbie the owner came out to give the estimate I did not even realize until a half hour into the conversation that he is the owner  a very unassuming nice man who knows his business The installers Devon and Alan were also very professional and friendly and were happy to answer all of my questions They worked very efficiently over 2 days to install both units The new 17 Seer American Standard units are impressive and I swear I am feeling airflow that did not exist before I am excited to finally see the efficiency increase and our utility bills decrease Based on my experience with Williamsons Heating  Cooling I highly recommend them
5,I was thoroughly impressed with the company from the moment that I called to receive a quote and schedule the service Williamsons provided a next day appointment While there was a large window for the service 14PM the company called to inform me that the technician was running ahead of schedule and could be there earlier They provided me with a 30 minute lead time to get home they were waiting when I arrived The service took no more than an hour and a half the technician Andy was polite and respectful I would recommend them in the future
5,Jean Paul did a great job on the estimate recommending a unit that would provide the best Seer rating without replacing my heater He provided an itemized list with the proposal The only complaint I have is the installers thought the unit was to stay on the ground when the proposal stated it should go on the roof but that issue was resolved before the guy with the crane left Still the installers should have had a copy of the work order with them Not every item listed was performed but I trust the installers had their reasons I did ask that the unit run as quietly as possible and Williamsons did well on accommodating me They sent Wally and Allen out and they muffled the noise the air turbulence created in the return duct metered it to be sure I was getting the right air flow pulled out the motor on the heater cleaned off the dust on the heater motor and added foam around something there It made a difference
5,changed air filters checked coolant level and air pressure
5,Went well and has worked well for 7 yrs
5,We did have to pay the weekend rate but we were happy to do so given how hot it was The cost was reasonable and the repairs were quickly performed We were very happy with the service and will definitely use Williamson again
5,Both our zoned units as well as a new hot water heater work GREAT Granted its only been a few days But I can not speak highly enough about the customer service We are impressed YES I would highly recommend this company and NOwe are not related just a great recommendation from our realtor JC
4,Although I have been happy with the work done under my service contract Williamsons is consistently unresponsive when it comes to other matters For example I have called them on different occasions about a bathroom ceiling fan a replacement thermostat and some minor duct modifications I leave a message and am promised that someone will call me back but no one does unless I nag them for several days I have also tried leaving a message with my service technician when he comes for his semiannual visits He promises to follow up but never does
5,The work has always been great They have been able come out after hours to assist with our needs
5,They did a good job I was happy with their work The repair of the thermostat was included within a maintenance plan with them and there was no additional charge
4,They did a good job and I liked them very much They are good but they are little expensive
5,INSTALLATION WENT WELL ACCORDING TO THE TENANT THE INSTALLERS DID A VERY EFFICIENT AND CLEAN JOB THE HOT WEATHER WHEN IT COMES WILL DETERMINE IF THE UNIT IS AS GOOD AS I THINK THE ENGINEER AND I HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS UP FRONT ABOUT SIZE THE OTHER TWO ESTIMATES WERE FOR THE NEXT SIZE UP BUT JOHN PAUL CONVINCED ME THE SIZE WAS RIGHT
4,The service technican was on time friendly courteous and knowledgable He told us what he checked and why and what he found
5,Great service wonderful technician Couldnt be happier The furnace is working well now and doesnt have the annoying noise that les us to call them in the first place They replaced two parts inducer fan and blower wheel and did a cleaning Manny was our tech and is a great guy very knowledgeable and thorough Highly recommend Williamsons
5,The old wall AC unit went out in our guest house and we decided to install a minisplit system to replace it after we had done our homework We called Williamson to do an estimate based on their good ratings with the BBB and Angies list and we were not disappointed The installed price was well within the reasonable range for the unit we needed the installers arrived on time and did a fabulous job on the installation That same evening the unit started to leak water we assumed the drainage was blocked for some reason We called their 24 hour service line and agreed we could wait until morning to have it looked at Their guys arrived early the next morning apologizing for the problem and fixed it quickly yep clogged drain line No problems since We are very happy with the unit and Williamsons I wouldnt hesitate to recommend them to anyone
5,They did excellent work They were very punctual They were very communicative in regard to what to do and in fixing some of the issues that I had They were very thorough
5,Our house was built in 1963 The new 70  70 cfm fan didnt quite fit in the space of the old fan but the technician was able to modify the space and adapt the duct work The new fan works just fine but is a bit noisy I dont remember if Williamsons offered us the option of a quieter fan We would have been willing to spend more if one were available
5,We have used them for a number of years and they have always been honest We would use them again and we would recommend them
5,Installed quickly and cleaned up after work Workers were polite and courteous Unit was installed as quoted and looked great
4,We first visited their office on S Alvernon Way Then we met them again at a home improvement show Our decision was based mostly on price The visit to their Alvernon office was not impressive The receptionist could not help us with our questions The sales person was busy on a telephone call in a back room After a few minutes we left without being helped As we were leaving the parking lot to merge onto a busy street the sales person ran up beside our car and tried to wave us down This was not safe or professional During the home visit we felt the technicians emphasis on replacing our complete system was slightly heavy handed
5,THEY GO BEYOND WHAT WAS EXPECTEDEVEN CHECKED OUT MY WATER HEATER
5,They gave me great info on my current system They didnt try to sell me a new system even though my current one is old I feel they were honest and straight forward with me I will definitely work with them again in the future They were very thorough Both my family and I use them for all of our needs
5,Williamsons Heating  Cooling did an all around fantastic job We had a really big problem with our ceiling and they came out very quickly with no hassle The high quality or their work made us very happy and we highly recommend them
5,THE MAN THAT COMES OUT IS VERY COURTEOUS AND NICE HE TAKES HIS TIME AND ALWAYS HAS A NICE CONVERSATION WITH ME BEFORE HE LEAVES THEY ARE JUST A WONDERFUL COMPANY
5,Very satisfied
5,Excellent service
5,Obviously very well
5,EXCELLENT great service
5,He did a good job
5,Great job start to finish
5,See above
1,Johnathan Delgado dont know who Jesse is assured me that the company was licensed and insured and that he would email the paperwork When asked again he said Ill send them tomorrow As he could never provide the Condo association with the documents he made me waste 2 weeks waiting for him to do it SO DISRESPECTFUL
5,I was very pleased Jesse was on time did great work Absolutely would call him again
5,Falero did an awesome job at fixing our sink and installing a new quality disposal Mike was amazing to talk with and walked us through each step I cant say enough about these guys and their work ethic and sterling quality of their work I would not only recommend them to anyone but I would use them again in a heartbeat
1,Vendor is not licensed as a plumber per Miami Dade BCCO database He arrived to work in our building which requires license and insurance and chose to register as a guest not a vendor to avoid this issue With that said he seemed nice however he vistited unit 2 times and each time failed to fix issue The first visit he arrived with no tools or inclination to do more then look at the unit and report it fixed which it was not to the property management team My experience overall was POOR Each time he tried to convince me the issue was resolved when it was not It has now been 30 days and I still have no functioning shower in my unit I would not recommend hiring this firm without a defined scope and confirmation that they are licensed and insured to do plumbing work in Miami
5,Highly recommend They came same day super friendly fast and cleaned up after
5,They are absolutely amazing
5,The quality of work was excellent They were the best plumbing Ive got They were timely the quality of the materials was good nice customer service nice guy and excellent service

1,Went over my list with them Was professional and indicated I would receive an estimate of cost Never heard from again and its been over two weeks
4,All work was done well and efficiently
5,Fantastic I would definately hire this contractor for another project I received a fair quote and was able to discuss the details I was able to easily schedule my visit I received email communication to confirm the visit The technician arrived right on time and even though he was working outside he wore a mask the whole time Justin K was clean respectful and professional He knew what he was doing and got the job done quickly The final bill was less than the estimate so that made me very happy Highly recommended
1,He never got back to me with an estimate Not even after I texted him to see if was interested or not
5,The handyman had obviously done his research and arrived with everything he needed and knew how it should be assembled as well as the local codes
5,Showed up on time Work completed in a timely manner
5,Kevin our tech was very professional and personable He was able to complete the work without issues and we are very satisfied with the job Communication from the office was great We knew who was showing up and when he would be here Great experience from beginning to end
5,They were wonderful they were on time didnt mess around and very professional I will have them come back nest Spring and I will continue to use them The Office Manager he responded immediately to my emails and calls
5,Unbelievable Beyond impressed with quality of service and the technician that arrived very punctually was very knowledgeable and polite Being a homeowner for approximately 10 years I have dealt with quite an assortment of contractors Mr Handyman has gained my trust after this experience especially after calling multiple contractors with a state of urgency all of whom replied they may be able to get someone out next week Mr Handyman dispatched a tech the next day I will not hesitate to call again THANK YOU
5,Eric did a phenomenal job repairing our deck and was a joy to talk to The work he did speaks for itself and he is obviously is skilled at what he does but what was also great was that he offered to do additional repairs outside the initial project scope I would definitely hire him for future deck repair and woodworking needs again
5,Awesome Bill did some of the same work for me last year so its nice that they try to keep staff youre used to do the jobs needed if possible
5,Very well The service was able straighten and reattach a long length of siding blown off and reattached siding tat was loosened The serviceman arrived earlier than estimated and completed the work quickly
5,Mr Handyman did good job considering the circumstances My mailbox was knocked down but the ground was froze I was provided with a sound temporary solution Plan on using Mr Handy man for the permanent installation
5,The Service Technician was extremely professional and paid close attention to our needs He advised us that the screening did not need to be replaced but only needed to be reseated in the door frame That saved us the cost of a new screen I would recommend Mr Handyman of Waukesha to anyone for household repair
4,Not completed yet Was unable to repair Will be replacing whole unit
5,Great Ron Marish was polite pleasant and completed the job quickly
5,It went well It has been over two weeks and no mice David was very professional and did a good job He cleaned up after the job was done I would definitely hire them again
5,I could not be more satisfied with Mr Handyman of Waukesha Bill came to do the evaluation and it was clear he knows home repair He is personable and I felt I could trust him  was glad that he was assigned to come back for the repair work I also appreciate their flexibility  Bill advanced the project to the point where I can do finish it with the painting Jessica in the office was great with communication I have finally found a reliable solution for home repairs I cant or dont want to do myself  I highly recommend them

5,I was very pleased with the responsiveness of both the office and the technician Bill I was kept informed every step of the way and the job was completed in a timely matter and with professionalism I never used a handyman service before and am not able to compare price and rate the cost I know enough that I will use Waukesha Mr Handyman again
5,The entire process was excellent We highly recommend Martin at Waukesha and Milwaukee County North Handyman Supurb
5,It went very well and timely Extremely satisfied and will hire again for different projects
5,All went well will monitor if leak has stopped and will have them return to replace drywall
5,It went great The technician Bill Andersen did a terrific job scrapingpainting the garage He went above and beyond in numerous ways eg cleaning the gutters on the garage so they look brand new meticulous scraping making suggestions that ended up improving the look of the garage He also replaced the leaf guards on the gutters around our house and did some other repairs on some of the trim on the back porch Throughout he was an excellent communicator showed up on time worked hard while he was here and cleaned up the work areas I couldnt have asked for a more skilled or professional technician This was our second job with Mr Handyman of Waukesha and North Milwaukee Will definitely use Mr Handyman again Also their prices were competitive given the high quality work that they do
1,I rated them F because there was no followup to my initial inquiry
5,Took longer than expected but good job
4,Price I paid was more than quoted but the job was well done and of all the contractors I contacted they were the most responsive Very up fronT with pricing and I like they send a picture of your contractor before he comes to your home Very communicative and professional
5,The job was more complicated than expected due to age of pocket doors and settling of house and took more time to complete Ralph the technician was very knowledgeable and efficient given the more complex job He completed the work in a very professional manner and was friendly and courteous Mr Handymans hourly costs were somewhat higher than I expected along with an additional 70 service charge but Ralph did an excellent job completing the work in 45 hours
5,Everything went great Don took everything into consideration when figuring out what needed to be done before starting the job The job went faster than expected Don did a fantastic job and I would recommend for any job needed to be done Thanks again
4,The carpenter had to run home to get his compressor which delayed the start and had to come back to the house after the project was done to pick up his cell phone charger that he left behind The work itself was just fine
5,Excellent job Would use them again
5,Technician was on time and work was done in a very professional manner
5,Went well the man they sent  Jerry was very professional and kept the area very neat I would ask for him again his work was outstanding
5,The work was done quickly and with precision The repaired area is matched perfectly to the existing drywall and texture There is no sign of the original cut out
5,Dennis was great Sent me a text right away and asked for photos then quoted me a very fair price Set up a time a few days later to come out and did the initial repair and came back the next day and did all the finishing work Very personable and professional too
4,slight scheduling issue other than that work man was extremely polite and work performed was satisfactory front door seems ready for winter weather Job involved removing door sinking door hinges deeper and evenly striping one side of door casing and installing a new door sweep
2,Had an appointment scheduled and got a call and left a message on the Friday before to cancel the appointment I had to call back to find out why and the carpenter quit and they had no one to do the work
4,Very Poor Didnt want the job Slow to get back with me but honest
5,Excellent job Looking forward to working with Justin again on my next project Hanging pictures on my wall
1,wanted to be prepaid in advance via estimatenot interested
4,it went as best it could on the repair
1,The guy called 20 min before the appointment to cancel by which time I had already rearranged my schedule for the day to meet with him He made excuses about his worker calling in sick or something and when I noted that that was not my fault he copped a very rude and unprofessional attitude to the point where I simply terminated the phone call I would NEVER spend money with these people RUN AWAY
1,We hired Mr Handyman to complete a drywall repair We had two spots in the house that plumbers cut out for repairs I called and was surprised that they gave me an estimate over the phone and scheduled the appt to do the work right then I went with it because I wanted the job done and the price seemed reasonable First off the handyman showed up to do a drywall repair and did not have any drywall or supplies Why would you show up with nothing He had general tools but no drywall So the first day he spent 34 fours cutting the spots out They charge over 100hour So four hundred dollars into the job and the job was 10 done The next day he showed up and we ran out to get drywall and supplies and they charge extra for trip charges The company only scheduled him for 4 hours on my job So by the time we got the supplies he only had 25 hours to work on my job We emphasis on we  I was his help for the entire job got drywall into one spot No mud or tapping So now I am into this job 800 and the job is 25 I am so  I called to complain and they claimed that he spent most of the time fixing previous work Such BS They wanted to schedule a followup appt to finish the job I said no thanks and I called a drywall company to fix The handyman also did not tape anything off so there was dust everywhere I cleaned up after everything he did because I didnt want to pay him 100hour to vacuum And the next day I noticed a couple outlets didnt work I am not sure what he did Another thingI also helped him with the job the entire time Placing the drywall screwing it in holding it up I went to the store with him and I cut 2x2s for him with my chop saw The only thing they did good was showed up on time I would not recommend these guys Hire a pro not a general handyman if you want the job done right
2,Pros  Work that was finished on siding was done well Cons  Job was left unfinished Workers claimed the remaining part of the wall was too dangerous to access without a lift even though nothing about it was pointed out during quoting and even into the first days of the job When I pointed out the unfinished part of the house I was informed that the quote was timematerials and I would receive a separate quote for the work that was supposed to be finished in the first place Still waiting for that quote  Soffit color did not match existing soffit I was informedafter the product was installed that the color I have would have to be special order and would take time to procure They had 2 months between our agreement and the actual work being done due to bad weather more than enough time to find and buy matching soffit
5,Mr Handyman sent Ralph Saverine for our job He was on time went out of his way to be responsive to our requests and was both personable and professional We have used the services of Mr Handyman in the past and will certainly do so in the future as projects come up
2,I had a water damage on my living room drywall and it took almost 4 visits spread across 2 weeks to fix it The quality of work was poor and they were supposed to complete the work with interior painting too But till date after 3 weeks of follow up the painting work is still not completed No response to emailsI made the mistake of paying them for the work done till date Now they have got paid it looks like they have conveniently decided not to respond and finish up the work
5,Ralph was professional and did a great job
5,Ralph was a pleasure to work with friendly prompt and trusted during the two visits
1,I sent a message on their website on Sept 12th They called me on the 13th and asked if I could send some pictures which I did When I did not hear back I called the next day I was told their tech had yet to look at the pictures but that he should get to it that day After still not getting a call back that business day I sent another message from their website I just wanted to know if they would take the job or if I needed to look elsewhere The next day a Friday and hour before they closed for the weekend I still hadnt heard from them I used the live chat on their website I got the feeling it wasnt live since the response was generic The guy I was chatting with wanted my phone number and email then abruptly ended the chat saying someone would contact me I did get a call back but the answer was the samethe tech still has to look at the pictures which he will do over the weekend To date which is Nov 29th I have yet to hear back However they have added me to their emailing advertising list which is ironic since they never followed up in any way for the job I needed done By the next Monday when they still had not contacted me I moved on to another company who wanted my business
4,They added blackjack around the seam of that  but it did nothing to stop the leaks When I called back to get next steps  they quickly said no thanks and suggested I call a roofer They charged quite a bit for not much service HOWEVER that said they were very professional cleaned everything up quite nicely  so I cannot complain there  they did what they were asked  but the leak persists
5,The was performed accurately and efficiently I would definitely use them again
5,The large holes were on about 30ft high Ralph was very knowledgeable on how to repair the damage He did a fantastic job I cant see where the damage was We are very happy with the job Ralph did We would definitely call him for any work we need done
1,I strongly discourage using this company First the handyman that quoted our job quit and a different handyman came in his place a day early The new man did a terrible job muffing and taping He took the entire day to get about half of a standard size living room done When your paying by the hour thats a big deal The next day when he was to come back he never showed and the company could not get a hold of him After waiting all day I went out to the store only to find that while I was gone he broke into my house to get his tools The company had nothing to say other than an apology I never heard from the company again for months until I was sent a letter letting me know theyre putting a lein on my house for a bill I never even saw So for 870 I had an incomplete job that had to be fixed by JB drywall
2,I found other comparable services providers who would do the same services for half the price The reason I chose to go with Mr Handyman is because they told me they could do the electrical that the other company told me up front they couldnt do Their tech came out install the microwave fine Hung the closet doors wrong before they were getting stuck after he finished they just fall of the track and removed switch plates and didnt replace them for the electrical to tell us he couldnt fix it For this I got billed for 35 hours of work for tasks that should have taken two hours and the electrical they couldnt do I did talk to the company and they were very eager to make it right and their second technician was able to correct what the previous tech did wrong but came back with same outcome on the electrical I am fine paying an electrician to fix the lights but I shouldnt have been billed for the time they decided they couldnt do it and moreover they should not have told me they could have done the lights if they couldnt
5,It was an excellent experience Dean went above and beyond in fixing the issue and was meticulous in the finishing He also came up with a solution for some rotting wood at the base of the windowdoor He also came up with a solution to the causesource of the water problem The end result was a night and day difference I look forward to working with Dean in the future
1,If I could give this company zero stars I would This is the worst experience that I have ever had with a contractor I truly cannot even understand how these people are still in business We called Mr Handyman to have two windows installed in place of one window We called this type of service because the existing opening would need to be changed for the two new windows to fit and I could not find a window installation company that framed openings I was assured that their guys would handle everything My quote was to be on Aug 1st with work to start on Aug 4th as long as I had the windows When the confirmation call came for the estimate I was told Aug 4th hadnt been saved for us and we were moved to Aug 10th but if something was canceled they would do the job sooner A little disappointing but understandable On Aug 1st their guy came out and did not do an estimate but told my husband that he had until 400 to work and would be able to get the two windows done as well as some of the basement windows we also wanted to install With that information my husband signed for him to start work However he didnt have all the tools he needed to do the job so he had to borrow them from us He was also called from the office and told he would have to leave the job by 300 to go to another job but he would have the two windows in by then since we now had a big hole in our home A little later one of the owners came out and told him he had to leave at 230 not caring that we had a big opening in our home In the end their guy left leaving a big hole in our home a window that he ruined by cutting the nailing tabs off and taking our battery and nice drill bit that had a sleeve to hold screws He said he would be back after 500 to finish the job We had to cancel our plans for the evening Worse than that upon further inspection we found that most of the work that had been done was wrong or unnecessary At 104 per hour one doesnt want to pay for these things Plus there was about an hour talking either to his office and the owner that I didnt think we should have to pay for When I called the office I was told they would check into the missing items but were in no way concerned with my window or the hole in my house I told them not to have their guy come back except to bring back the tools He never showed up The next day I called and was told I was lying and that nothing had been taken from our home We were still going to be billed and that I needed to take the issue of the window up with the owner It took 3 days to speak to him and he didnt call me In the mean time I called the office and told them that if the items were not returned that I would get the police involved Later that day I got a call that their guy had suddenly realized that he did have our items She didnt know if it had anything to do with the threat of the police but he would be returning our items She apologized and asked if they could send someone else out I of course said no because not only did their guy not know what he was doing but they also had very bad customer service I spoke to her about the window telling her that they can certainly have the window I just need to be reimbursed because I had to purchase another window which I also had to order and wait for another week for it to come in She was very apologetic and said she would relay the information to the owner When I finally got a hold of the owner he said that he would not be paying for the window and that his guy did know what he was doing I told him that just because we chose to hire someone to do the work rather than do it ourselves didnt mean that we didnt know what should and shouldnt be done At that point he no longer let me speak but instead starting belittling us for hiring someone to do a job we could do ourselves At this point I swore at him and he hung up When I called back he hung up again I then called back and spoke to the other owner She was no better than the other guy She threatened to put a lien on our home DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY To recap One window damaged new one still on order tools taken room left a mess horrible owners DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY
5,I was signing their praises We have really had very positive experience with them
5,Weve had nothing bad happen from them They always come right away honestly I cant say enough good about them My son moved to Austin and I made sure he knew to check in with Mr Handyman They are always on time and if they arent they always call Theyre professional and seem to know what they are doing They have always been able to do what we needed them to come do We have just always had positive experiences
5,went according to plan and met our expectations
1,Worst install I have ever been apart of Was rough quoted 5 hours for 2 storms and 2 entry came home to check on the job and the installer made it known he was leaving at 4 At the end of the day they installed 1 door I will admit it wasnt an average install but it was 1 door in 6 hours The door was so poorly installed there was gap on the bottom of the door that I could see clearly out to the yard There was spray foam insulation on the new doors and the house and yard were left a complete mess Screws in the grass GREAT for young kids and dogs shards of wood cardboard and stuff left everywhere I called and gave ample opportunity for the franchise owner to rectify this and all I got was there nearly 700 bill for a garbage install and another bill to have someone else come back to correct the garbage job Mr Not so Handyman did the first time Still no call from the owner I would not EVER recommend these people to anyone Not worth the money
1,They never showed up for the appointment on 43 and I havent heard from them since
5,Very well Needed a part Once part arrived work was completed He listened to what I needed Made a recommendation which saved hundreds of dollars
2,Well the customer service was good Very professional they called back right away The contractor showed up on time and that was it After he left I have yet to hear back from Mr Handy I paid 50 for a quote that I have yet to receive It has been a week I was told the quote would take 1 to 2 days Well they missed out a job and if I do not receive the quote by Saturday I will be calling to get my money back
5,On time worked diligently to complete all jobs
5,Was on time ran  got supplies needed  installed to the best of his ability
5,Very well Dean did what he was suppose to do
5,Excellent Dean is very knowledgeable about his work  has a great personality The work was done timely  all the patch work  painting was a perfect match  blended in beautifully
4,One of the repairs replacing some molding on a screen door didnt last The new molding came out a couple of days after the repair
3,My wife and I had completed the footing and framing ourselves but needed a hand getting it completed before winter I uploaded some pictures to Mr Handyman and the two in the office one being the owner said it would probably take a days worth of work with 2 people They sent out a carpenter who was able to look at the job before we started and said it was at least 2 days of work I was ultimately ok with this as I know its hard to see a job with pictures When the carpenter came out he was early which was great because he needed to get all set up and going I had left When I returned they had about 48 sq ft of deck completed and all of the starting hooks installed There was 2 guys with a 3rd working about 2 hours By the time the day was done they had about 100 Sq ft of deck installed and instead of taking 2 days it was now estimated at 7 days They charge 98 an hour for the carpenter and 63 for the 2nd hand plus about 87 for a trip charge This project if I had them finish it would cost me nearly 10000 I got another quote from a guy that does Trex decks in the range of 1800 The carpenter for Mr Handyman did superb work He was very meticulous and what he did complete looked great He claimed that the joists were 12 apart and there was a lot of shimming that needed to be done That was the reason for the time put in and the length of time it would take Not sure why this was detected earlier The second day that was initially scheduled could not be done until 1107 I cancelled the second day and plan to hire someone else to complete it
1,They came to give me an estimate and never heard from them again Horrible experience
5,They were prompt and did good work A little on the expensive side at 90hr not including materials
2,Called a couple times and phone just rings no answering machine either Quite odd
5,This is our third time using this handyman company and all three times it has gone well While they probably arent the cheapest around all three times they have been prompt professional and got the job done well Mike the technician did have a bear of a time soldering in the new faucet in a really awkward part of the basement ceiling hence the main reason I was not about to attempt this but did a thorough job He had to order a couple of parts for the Pella screen door and the shower door which we bought at Home Depot looks fantastic now that it is installed in the master bathroom I would hire them again
5,Everything all went well Jason did a great job and was nice to my family He kept me in the loop as far as when he would be at the house and would always keep me updated I am very satisfied with everything
5,Services performed were excellent Technician was very friendly and knowledgeable and we would have them back for future projects
5,This was the easiest process I have booked in a long time they were on time and did not drag the process outvery happy with the job
5,This was our first time using MrHandyman and it was a great experience The technician was punctual professional and efficient We will be using Mr Handyman again for any repair projects I need done around my home
5,A very nice job and great to get all of those things done that have been hangin
5,Excellent He did the work professionally and on time
2,Mike was punctual for our appointment July 28 He was pleasant and seemed knowledgeable We have a number of small unfinished projects we would like to get done along with a larger project in the kitchen to replace the counters and do some cabinet work as well as a couple of outdoor tasks involving the eavestrough and minor siding repairs I had been very clear with Mike that the estimate should be broken out by job for example the exterior projects as one sum kitchen separate and smaller odd jobs as its own sum When i had not received the estimate for the work within a week I contacted the office and was told Mike had the estimate in his truck and would send it through Nothing arrived We had a death in the family so I did not contact the office again until yesterday only to have them call today and ask about what work I wanted done I explained that Mike had been here a month ago and I was still waiting for the quote Later this afternoon I received the quote for 6400 but it was just one sum not broken out as I requested so I have no idea how much the kitchen work is as compared to the eavestrough etc and overall the total seemed very high to me I wrote back and asked for the quote as I requested it a month ago no response yet Either way we are going to use someone else If getting an accurate quote is this challenging I doubt I have the patience to deal with managing them for an actual job Its too bad  we could have been good clients as neither of us are handy and we would much rather pay for good work than try to bumble along on our own
4, Work was of good quality  Coordination between office and contractor was not good Consequently items were not ordered in timely fashion and project completion was stretched out  Originally assigned contractor did not show up for first appointment Waited for close to an hour Replacement contractor was punctual and did a good job  They provide a nice service and I would use them again Things work better when you communicate directly with the contractor versus going through their central office
1,I needed a handyman to make improvement to a few items on a house we were selling The original employee that came to the house severely underestimate the time that it would take to complete the job While at the job site he wasted a lot of time lied on him time card and did not show up prepared for the job He took apart the windows and then left to go get parts He was gone for 4 hours when he came back to the house it started to rain so he duct taped plastic around the windows and left He charged us for 10 hours of work at nearly 100 dollars an hour I contacted the office with my complaints and gave them written statements about what had taken place They notified me that I was not the only person to have this type of issue and the employee was let go they said they would honor the price that was originally quoted but it took over a month for them to get someone back out to the house In the mean time we are trying to show our house for sale with big ugly bags on our windows Need less to say we didnt get any offers during that time Once the second employee came out the finish the work he was very fast but at the expense of some sloppy workmanship I would not recommend Mr Handyman to anyone I know
5,Upon the first visit everything went as expected the guy came out on time removed the casing used a moisture meter to verify where the water was and even provided some tips on how to dry out the casing treat for potential mold and repaint the casing I opted to do the painting to save some money After a few days the office called to schedule the return trip to put everything together which was really nice as it saved me on having to call in for an appointment On the return trip I did run into a snag where the first appointment of the day was running late so I received a call from the scheduler to let me know he would be an hour late I waited an extra 30 minutes past the revised arrival time but Mike never showed up I called back and received the answering service which was not very helpful Now 2 hours late I called back at which point the answering service said they would get the message to the scheduler but I never received a call back that day The next day I called and received the scheduler at which point she had Mike out later that day Overall I was impressed with Mikes knowledge and attention to detail on making sure everything was taken down and put back to look like it never happened I would be nice if in the future if the service man cant make it out you would get proper notification so you are not waiting around all day I would use them again for the items around the house which require more skill than I possess or am comfortable doing myself
1,Here is my response to each of his points At that time all gutters were cleaned and all downspouts were working properly  How can you confirm It was December 15th and there was no rain at the point of time gutters were supposedly clean Again the technician cleaned the gutter but did not clean the debris at the elbow joints We have cleaned his gutters before and he always waits to the last minute to get them cleaned This is classic example of lame excuse Did you ever mention late when I called you If you think you cannot serve me in a professional manner rather than sending a lousy technician and do not stand up for your doing later Signed the work order stating everything was good and to charge his credit card  My wife signed it and she also mentioned me the technician was done in 20 minutes  and i was charged for 2 hours As I hired them before  I let it go by with some kind of trust and reliability I admit I made a mistake and should have notified them about the time On Dec 24th we were at removed member name house to fix the extension to the gutters to keep the water away from his house nothing was said that there was a problem 6 months go by and we get a call stating that we did a sloppy job on his gutters and downspouts I first noticed a problem when it rained hard this May Some water overflowed the gutters after a hard rain  Just to keep the fact straight they came to my house on Dec 15th  I called in November I saw the problem late April and thoughts my gutters are not working properly I request quote from 3 different gutter companyThey said my gutters are fine but the joints are clogged as it was not cleaned properly before winter 6 months go by and we get a call stating that we did a sloppy job on his gutters and downspouts  Do not exaggerate you better know dec to april are freezing months  during warm up the freezing water can seep by the clogged elbows The problem starts when you start to have April showers And at that time I have noticed the problem and start to find the reason Clogged elbow will not cause of Ice daming I would like to make everyone happy when we do work for our customers customer service is important to us as we are a customer service company We do have a warranty on our work if the craftsmanship is not up to your standards or a part fails during the first year This is the first time I have complained your cleaning You have cleaned my gutter previous three years  annually at the same time just before winterand no problem happened  This time you did a lousy job hence the problem occurred and I have complained  Actually I have called 3 times  every time the problem was supposedly noted by your receptionist after the third time she said me to sent an emailwasted my time After getting no response of the email when I called back  she chatted 2 minutes with someone and said  gutter cleaning does not have a warranty You took 10 days to responsesaying you will do nothng starting from my first day of complaint Is this a sign of a customer service company
5,It went great Menard was very professional and did a great job I still have a few other jobs we discussed that I will have him back to complete
5,This is a very old house Consequently all the pipes  routes to them were in small hard to get at places The bathtub is upstairs but the clog extended to the downstairs Mike knew everything we needed to get the job done and it took minimal replacement parts  some new PVC  This man was awesome He worked hard getting covered in black crap  he even cleaned up the mess after he was done He explained it all as he went We felt his price was more than fair We could have kicked each other later because we needed him more than a few times after but could not find his contact info to save our lives I dont think AL had him posted for me to review We couldnt even remember his name for sure   no we were not under the influence We do think it was Mike tho So Mike if you are reading this please get more advertizing out for yourself Im sure that others will be impressed with your work
5,Created the arms to replace what original installer had and correct problem with amazing quality at a fraction of the cost of replacing the window
5,Jim arrived on time and explained in detail what was going to be performed Very polite Work area cleaned Look forward to having Jim return for future work
5,From start to finish a job well done
5,Chad and Mike picked up the new door at Home Depot and installed it They had to remove the outer storm door to do this which took about as much time to put back in as it did to install the new entry door They did a good job and even moved some hardware from the old door frame to the new door frame that I requested Very courteous explained what was going on and did the job as asked
5,We were on a very tight timeline to get the work done prior to closing on the sale of a house When I called them Debbie answered the phone and knew exactly what I was talking about and made a very close estimate on how long all of the work would take My only complaint and its not specific to this job is that I hate paying for service by the hour I always wonder if the provider is working to the best time equation or if the work is being drug out to get another 30 minutes of pay I dont have evidence that this happened this time but I just wonder I was also concerned about a 10 charge for a few pieces of tape used on the dryer vent Im not sure that was a just price In the end the work was done and done well I cant complain about anything in regards to the quality of the work And the responsiveness of the office staff was superbfrom the first call to the electronic copy of the paid receipt and lien reciept we needed to provide the lender
2,They came out to give an estimate for interior painting in multiple rooms but they never got back with me
3,They were very expensive compared to other handyman services that is why I stopped using them I had a big issue with their professionalism I would probably not use them in the future
5,It went extremely well They were responsive They came when they said they were going to come right down to the second They performed the work that was requested and they kept true to their cost estimates The repairs have lasted for two years just long enough which was what I needed long enough so I could afford to replace the pergola So I am extremely happy because I was concerned the repairs were not going to be structurally sufficient to last as long as they have and they have They are not cheap but you get extremely good quality work I didnt think anybody could make that pergola last at all but they did
5,The overall quality of the work was good The gentleman was pleasurable He was a nice guy He put it in and he was talkative Everything was fine He did a good job I would recommend them He did the job and he knew what he was doing He did it professionally and has done it very well
5,He did an absolutely beautiful job I really feel that the price was fair It has held up beautifully I have no complaints They cleaned up beautifully
4,They did a good job Theirs was the lowest bid out of the three or four people that I checked out They had to take shutters down paint them and put them back
1,We live in a mobile home there was only a small piece of siding that got affected they were more interested in the fence that was across the way that is owned by the owner of the mobile court They were more interested in fixing the fence which is owned by the mobile court owner It was probably a 250 job probably to fix it which we still dont have fixed He didnt even write up an estimate or anything We asked multiple people to please write up an estimate and nobody was willing to do it My sister in the last year to do a job and she was more than happy with him but to do this little tiny job they were not willing to do If you have this huge job thats worth thousands of dollars yes the kind that you probably have to take a bank loan out yes But if you have this menial task thats probably beneath them no They didnt even gave us an estimate they didnt want to do it
4,He showed up and he was very professional He came on time analyzed the problem and said it will take X number of hours to do the work and he was spot on He was very friendly and told me how he began as a handyman It was something he wanted to do for sometime and he is good at it
4,It was fine I didnt have a problem with the storm door that they fixed It was okay It got the job done but it wasnt really pretty It was an old storm door The screws had pulled out of the wood and had been repaired several times it just wasnt working so he was able to fabricate a metal plate to put in there and attach that screw that in and then attach the door closer to that so its working its just not real pretty
1,Sent an email to get a quote Got bac to send them my phone Sent it After 7 days no return After all bad reviews I am not going with them
5,Installation went without a hitch Friendly expeditious professional service I had been concerned about this installation because Home Depot installers claimed I ordered the wrong size door for the space and seemed to want to create barriers to getting the job done like scheduling me weeks out I had faith in the manufacturer ironically a supplier of Home Depot and in my measurements And I really had the feeling Home Depot didnt want to do it Mr Handyman just came out and did the work Fit was perfect door looks and functions great
2,The work to be done at my mothers home was estimated at approximately 7507 hours of labor which broke down to 90 dollars per hour plus materials The worker showed up at 830 am as promised and finished part of the work by approximately 830 pm This did include trip to the store for some unexpected but needed parts and a side trip to another job site He had not yet completed the faucet replacement He was to return at 830 am the next morning He called me at 720 am the next morning and said he was on his way to my mothers home but did not have the tool needed to bore holes in the tub for the new faucet He did however leave the bill and despite my asking him to do so made no contact with my mother I attempted to reach him at 11 am wondering when he would be returning to my mothers home as she had already had to cancel a medical appointment to accommodate the second day of work I was told he would be there after 3 pm By 330 pm my mother rescheduled for another day I found it funny that I had received a customer satisfaction survey prior to the work being completed I did contact Mr Handyman to ensure that the bill would not be paid until the work was complete They were agreeable to that arrangement On the new date the worker showed up on time and finished the faucet installation He did require my mother to sign another work orderbill for the faucet work prior to the job being started The worker failed to clean up his mess where the new floor under the water heater was installed He also did a poor job of reinstalling the paneling and trim that covered the access to the tub water supply I will say that the trim was not in the greatest shape to start but there was a complete length albeit in segments that held the paneling in place After his work there are simply small non continuous segments of trim holding the paneling in place Her final bill was 116510 and according to the worker she was not charged for his shopping time and only charged half the labor time for the faucet installation I did read at least one review on Angies list that Mr Handyman did not honor their estimate but I opted to go with them anyway Most of the work was done well but I would not hire Mr Handyman again due to the significant difference in the estimated number of hours to complete the job vs the actual time to complete the work resulting in an increase of over 300 in her final bill
1,I called to check availability and rates for a handyman to install some doors and light fixtures The secretary took my name and number and stated that scheduling would get back to me with availability No one ever called back Three days after my initial call I called back explaining that this was my second call The secretary took my info again and list of projects to be completed She stated I would receive an email with an estimate I never received an email estimate or return call  Also they charge 96hour along with a one time fee of 58 for travel I guess This is expensive compared to others I have researched
5,I had a very good experience They were very prompt courteous and very nice
5,Great  no complaints They returned my calls and emails most importantly they showed up on time they completed the work in 1 day  cleaned up afterwardWould absulutely use them again
5,I use the same person over and over again which they are allowed to do You can have whoever is available when you want or you can have the same person over and over It is very easy to schedule stuff If you need them on a specific day they are pretty good at getting me in I paid them on hourly basis and the things I have done was for three hours and they will go on drive if they dont have them on truck and it has happened to us once
5,Chad is really really good at what he does when it comes to repairs and upgrades There was a bunch of stuff that needed fixing at my duplex and Chad was fantastic The best part of the service is Chad had a idea for a door closer on the door from the attached garage to the back hall that was brilliant I had bought one of those auto closers you see on screen doors but Chad was afraid a taller person would get poked in the eye by it in the cramped quarters of the small garage He came up with a much better solution Using his expert carpenter skills he modified the door hinge area of the wood door and installed spring loaded door hinges I have never seen them before but do they work great Now when one of my tenants leaves doesnt remember to closet he door behind them the door automatically shuts itself now Much safer for everyone in the building and way more energy efficient in the cold winter months Chad is the best
1,On March 27 2014 I had an appt with Joe for 830 am By 915 I called the office Debbie answered she didnt apologized for the delay just said the office was hectic and she was sending Marty the owner and he will be there by 10 Marty showed up closer to 1030 saying it was a hectic morning We went over what I wanted done and he said he will get back to me with an estimate April 7 I called since I had yet to received an estimate Marty answered the phone saying he had some family issues and will get on it I said not a problem April 21 I called again to inquire about my estimate Debbie answered and said that Marty had some family issues I said not a problem but I would like to get the estimate she assured me she will let Marty know April 29 I called again to inquire about the estimate Debbie answered and said she will let Marty know and that I will receive a call the next day april 30 either from her or Marty April 30  no calls from either May 1 today I called Marty answered I asked if he remembered me he said yes I asked for my estimate and also said I feel as if he didnt want my business He got very loud and said he was working on it with all these other companiesthen puts me on speaker phone I asked him what is up with the attitude I have been very polite thru out I said all I want is an estimate and it has been a month and I thought they were nice when they came out last summer to give us an estimate at that time I really didnt know what I wanted this time I did as I was trying to tell him that I thought they were nice he hung up on me I am not sure why there was such a delay with my estimate all the other estimates was in within 7 days In fact the estimate from his company last summer was submitted within 7 days after meeting I have been polite and courteous thru out this past month when I said I feel as if he didnt want my business I said it in jest I absolutely didnt not expect such over the top reaction from him Why come out if they didnt want my business Or why not tell me after the second phone call Marty Putz is totally unprofessional and I will not recommend this business to anyone I do not care whatever type of awards Marty has received his dealing with me has been unprofessional and a disgrace to those in his industry
5,Excellent service They came in and diagnosed it for a reasonable price
5,They did an excellent job but they were an hour late and didnt call to tell me they were going to be late They are also very expensive
5,Well now I have met all the great people at Mr Handyman and Chris was fantastic too So for your projects big and small I can definitely recommend this great provider The project was more complicated than it sounds because Chris had to drill through existing tile to install the new towel bars No tiles were chipped or nicked which was great because I didnt have any spare tiles Chris is an expert at what he does Some of the towel rods were too long and he had to cut them to fit but everything turned out better than perfect These are great people to work with as their office is easy to schedule with and the field guys are very very dependable
4,Good service and very professional The costs for the services were very expense
5,Fast friendly and professional describes the work done by Jerry of Mr Handyman When I called in to schedule the person in the office was fantastic and I knew exactly what time and day to expect Jerry Who is a peach and was very thoughtful too and completely did the work and cleaned up so everything is as good as new This sounds like two simple things but it was not The first installation of the large multitier towel bar was not done correctly by another vendor and when it fell off the wall it left two gaping holes Jerry installed it securely and perfectly patched over the holes Great job I would recommend this company to anyone you has those lists of things that need to be done well as their home too
4,They did a fine job cleaning the gutters but when I tried to get them back for some repeat business they never responded I asked him about several other things while he was here and he seemed interested but I have given up and hired others to take care of those jobs
3,The gentleman came outhe was very nice made a list of the things we wanted doneprovided a quotethen never showed up or called us
5,They were outstanding Treated my home as if it were their own Protected stairs walls and furniture as they were removing items
5,Work was done very professionally Technician was very courteous and polite I asked him to observe other necessary repairs  he noted nothing other than what I had already observed and did not appear to try selling me on any unnecessary services My only complaint was that I requested a quote for a few followup projects but never received that quote Nevertheless given the quality of the work  I will use this provider again
5,Matched and installed a deadbolt for an exterior door I was slightly disappointed that the deadbolt was something i could have purchased at the local DIY store but it works fine and the installation was professionally done
5,Ive used them several times and they work with you they are always there when I need them and they do very good work And if they dont do good work theyll come back and theyll fix it no questions askedIve got to also buy my own materials All the other places they bring the material and they have a markup on it Theres no other place that I know of I just had some work done by Monty and I think there were parts that had to be replaced or rebuilt and they set it up for me but I paid for it and it saved me pretty close to 50 if not more Because I needed some sections of the kickpanels of the door they were scuffed up and I wanted it painted and you have to have a plastic paint for that They called NAPA and they gave my name told me to give them a call said Ill pay for it etc They told me it would cost me 140 some odd dollars for the paint for two cans And I paid NAPA 25 Thats the markup Just for the sake of we need this part to fix it So thats what Mr Handyman allows me to do I will supply the materials and you supply the labour you know what I mean So I am very happy with them very happy As a matter of fact I had a little bit of plumbing work done with them they came in gave me an estimate And I said You tell me exactly what you need I will go and get it for you and they couldnt find a corresponding number for it they said well go down well get it for you and we wont give you the markup Well give you the receipt for it  which was nice of them Its a franchise but the one here I like The other ones I dont know The one I dealt with I am extremely happy You call them they talk to you theyll take all the time that you need on the phone in front of you whatever I like the workmanship that they do and if they screw up at all they come back and they fix it They put in a basement window for me I had other people come in where I was going to buy it from them They came in and were going to charge me a minimum charge of 450 and of course you get all the excuses like Oh we have to pay them for minimum four hours work etc etc These guys They came in and they did it in an hour and they charged me an hour of labour and I supplied the parts
3,I went with this company due to what I seemed to be a fair price based on the estimate given by the installer The actual installer and customer service representative on the phone were very easy to work with and pleasent We missed the original install date but rescheduling was not a major issue The installation went smoothly and the installer was very careful not to make a mess I did experience a leak in the faucet line which I discovered the next morning but was able to get someone out the next day to fix the leak My concern with this project comes with the final price as compared to the original estimate When I received the original estimate of 350 the installer said it would be a 300 project He put a 50 cushion on the estimate in case he ran into any issues I was not advised of any major issues with the installation or other that would have increased my bill from the original estimate In the end the final bill was 599 or almost double the original estimate Per the installer since there was such a large discrepancy I contacted the company to discuss the final bill in light of the scheduling issues and eventual leak I had experienced I was very flexible to work with their schedule After the missed original installation date I took a day off of work to meet their schedule I received a response from the owner that I consider rude and in my opinion unprofessional I was accused of using Angies list as a pawn to get money off for a possitive review which in no way was my intent I take great responsibility in writing these reviews as I rely on other customer reviews to help make my service provider decisions I was offered a 50 off coupon and was told I would either be taken out of their system or highlighted in red for future services I asked they remove me from their system Final opinion I am satisfied with the work performed but dissatisfied with the discrepancy between the original estimate and final bill I should have been advised during the installation if the final bill was not going to be consistent with the estimate Customer service was mixed
5,If you need a professional company to help you with repairs this is the company you should call I cannot thank them enough for helping me out with an emergency repair I needed today due to damaged caused by one of my tenants Mr Handyman went out of their way to come all the way to Shorewood and fix the doors that were broken and caused a security problem This is a fantastic provider and I know you will be happy with the service they provide to you too This business is owend by Marty and he and his wonderful office staff found a way to help me on such short notice which I appreciated and Chad their technician did a fantastic job
5,We found them on Angies List They were very professional They responded quickly and they also followed up with quotes fast as well Overall they were very nice people One thing they did was instead of doing everything they even gave us options so that we could fix it ourselves if we didnt want to pay them to help save us money as well so they were very accommodating I would definitely call them again if we need to do stuff around the house
4,The first guy did not do a good job However they sent another guy to fix and complete the work
4,The service was okay I felt the price was a little expensive
3,His service is fine but the cost is way too high for the work done
5,It went well Theyre always easy to reach and they can get things scheduled and done quickly They can also buy and pickup all materials so I wasnt having to do any running around myself
4,Because they charged me a 50 trip charge and never disclosed that this would be part of the costs I feel like they deceived me I would not hire them to come back because of this
5,Super friendly and professional on the phone and in person Did the jobs quickly did not milk the hourly rate Keep in mind that if they have to get parts or supplies that you dont provide or tell them that theyll need to bring they do inform you of this when you set up your appointment that the time to go get things is billable When I have another list of stuff to get done I will definitely call them again
4,The work was done quickly and well the only issue was the complexity due to the number of switches turning on a light The handyman needed additional help and added some time to the project It turned out good but was more difficult to estimate total cost
5,He was within budget on time and very professional The job turned out great He was reasonably priced I would use them again in the future
5,Gave accurate time estimate arrive on time every time help prevent future problems
4,Overall it went OK and the end product was fine The workman however broke the vanity basin that he was installing by applying too much torque before the basin was properly set The basin broke and flying porcelain hit the workman in the head causing significant bleeding Stuff happens and the workman was apologetic and the cut wasnt as bad as it appeared He also indicated that he had several other mishaps in the course of his handyman work fell in a hole while carrying a big door acorn junk in his eye while cleaning a gutter etc In any event they readily replaced the basin within a couple of days and came and fixed and finalized everything to our satisfaction
4,Very friendly and punctual Worked quickly and efficiently Very reasonably priced
2,I thought the trip charge was a little high He came to do a standard plumbing job which he knew in advance You would think he had standard plumbing supplies in his truck but no he left again to pick up parts at a store which is 4 miles down the road and returned 1 hour later charging me 88 dollars for the trip while doing the job he spilled glue on the floor which stained it and never came off I would never recommend them to any one in the future
3,We hired Mr Handyman to install doors in December of last year Quality and price were good however punctuality was not We were the first job of the morning and he was an hour late The poor grades are a result of them never following up on a larger job we had called on After a positive experience with the doors we called for an estimate to remodel a bathroom and convert a room into a 1st floor laundry We never received a call back called a 2nd time and were told they forgot We do not recommend them since there was zero follow through
3,Initially we were satisfied with the work We ran into the problems with the most recent work They sand blasted the fireplace hearth without a hepafilter That left fine dust all over the house My husband is on oxygen and the dust caused serious breathing problems I have contacted the owner Marty and have spoken to him multiple times He is unwilling to take responsibility and said that I should have told the worker to stop once I saw the dust He hung up on me and refuses to talk to me further I had to hire another company to clean the dust and that cost me 500 All Marty offered was 300 of free service from them but I never want them in my home again
5,Mark came to do the estimate and he was also the one who did the job His performance was above and beyond the call of duty as he had to work in full sun on one of the hottest days of the summer He was on time and he completed the job in the time he thought it would take He was extremely professional I also spoke with Debbie in the office numerous times and she too was great to work with She was on vacation when I thought wed have the bill so I called the office and Marty the owner took the call It was a pleasure to deal with him also I can only give Mr Handman high praise Thanks to Angies List for helping me to find them We will certainly call them again when we have jobs like that to be done Our original handyman retired so we were at a loss for a time but Mr Handyman appeared at the right time Thank you to Marty Debbie and especially Mark who worked so hard in the heat
5,Chris arrived about 5 minutes early and I had two lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling in the garage and wanted them replaced with ceiling fans Chris put the ceiling fans together and installed them he even programmed the remote control so that both ceiling fans run from the same remote He was kind enough to look at my garage door opener that was giving me some trouble He even shared with me a product that he uses to repair cracks in drywall He was very nice and took the time to look and fix a couple of smaller items He took about 2 12 hours to complete the job and cleaned up everything completely I have called the company to have additional work completed
5,The workman was competent and pleasant The work was performed very promptly The job was reasonably priced
2,When they came over to do the work I needed they didnt give me the discount the flyer promised and they charged a travel charge as well
5,He completed his job in a couple days with the two areas we had agreed upon He was up front and honest with everything and the price was what it should be with no added charges When he came over he noticed that our screen door gets stuck in the open position which had been a problem since we moved in but wasnt as high of an item on our to do list He had an extra part for the door and fixed that in a couple minutes no extra charge Very helpful answering questions I would contact this company in the future and recommend their services to anyone looking for quality work done
5,We are in the middle of renovating our kitchen on a shoestring budget and the dated and leaking kitchen faucet had to go The plumbing configuration under our kitchen sink is unusual due to the ginormous garbage disposal unit that the previous owners have installed It takes up one half of the double cabinet with the sound muffling foam thing on it Its a beast So after giving it a look we knew it was time to call in someone with way more experience and the proper tools to do it right Chris showed up right on the dot and got to work He had to make a quick run to the hardware store since we bought the wrong supply lines It took about an hour and 20 minutes and I am sure a lot of contortion to get it done but he did it He then gave me some advice on how to prep the chrome finish existing air gap cover to paint it to make it match the oil rubbed bronze finish on the faucet because the bronze finished ones are oddly expensive for some reason Everything was left neat and tidy and it works so nice and nothing leaks anymore We felt that while we could possibly have paid slightly less for another service there was no vague appointment window they are employees of the company with background checks and good ratings on Angies List and that it was well worth the splurge and we are happy
5,They were very good I would rate them highly and would use them again in the future if needed
5,Called Mr Handyman on 62011 to have gutters cleaned Even though weve had a lot of rain lately and thought it would be awhile before they could come out Brad was there on 62211 at 800 am as promised It took him about an 1 12 hrs to complete the job Our gutters are absolutely immaculate now The cost was a little pricey at 8600hr However due to my husband having recent surgery we had no choice but to hire someone to do the job The 2500 coupon from Angies List helped and most of all Brad did an excellent job
5,He did a great job He worked quickly and completed the project in a timely manor Overall I was satisfied with his service
5,Overall the experience went well Weve used them three times now and theyre phenomonal Theyve been very punctual courteous professional and performed the work in a timely manner on all three visits They have an hourly rate which is reasonable They also provide Angies List discounts The owner of My Handyman had subcontracted out another company when we had the gutter guards installed but the owner was there throughout the process Im satisfied with their services and I would highly recommend them
5,These guys are exceptional They immediately discovered that the builder had never included supports so they added the supports replaced the rough cedar posts  on time at budget you cannot see that the posts were replaced A pleasure to work with  and will do so again when needed next time
1,We met Marty on April 13 2010 We went over everything we needed done Porch railings on bottom some window sills covered in aluminum garage door trim and rubber seal replacedWe told him we would like it done by end of April He said ok We waited for some time we called him he called us eventually he said after a couple of weeks that he couldnt find railings that long and will see if he can order them By the end of April or so later after coming to the house a total or 2 or 3 times to meet measure job he said he ordered the porch railings We had originally set up 2 or 3 tentative times to do the job As of today he called and said on this Monday he will come tomorrow Tuesday to do the job I said ok Then a few hours later on Monday he left a message and said he cant do the job and to get somebody else He said something feels wrong and he doesnt feel he can do a good job for us This is almost 6 weeks later after first meeting him I tried to call him and l left a message stating that that was horrible what he did to us and unprofessional and told him of course I will make a report on Angies List
5,The service call went well he was on time and very nice Explained what he did and explained the programming of the garage door keypad Also unstuck a ceiling fan chain
5,He did a fabulous job He was here the next day after I called in the morning with all the supplies He was polite and very good He was very prompt in responding to my call and finished the work on time The price was also reasonable He told me what he wanted to do and asked me if I wanted him to do anything else He is very neat and tidy He cleaned up after himself I have recommended him to a friend of mine
3,They did what they came over here to do but I remember that we were not that pleased with the work They were responsive but we just were not very happy
5,He installed 2 deadbolts changed the locks on 3 doors and gave me keys for them He also went to the hardware store and got me a door knob with a lock in it and he did a nice job and I was satisfied with him He was accommodating and waited for me because I was late
5,He did a really good job He cleaned up everything when he was completed and was very prompt
5,He was very polite and did a great job of explaining what he would do and how it would be done They gave me a 25 dollar discount for being an Angies List member He did a great job overall
5,He was very prompt knowledgeable of how to work with difficulties and was tidy He performed a high quality of service
5,I would use him again in the future
5,We have no complaints about him at all He was very personal and very polite He kept me informed about the job how explained everything We were very satisfied
5,They are really good They are prompt and on time They got the job done in one day They are professional and I have used them before Their prices are very fair
4,The first employee was very courteous and did an excellent job with the patching texturizing and painting Unfortunately the caulking wasnt quite up to par After talking to Amy at My Handyman we made another appointment for someone else to come out to recaulk Another employee from My Handyman Chip came out about a week later and redid the caulk at no charge Chip did a good job is a pleasant person and thoroughly cleaned up the area afterwards
5,They were efficient knowledgeable They had the right tools to get the job done quickly and properly
5,We always get Chip as our handyman He is a perfectionist so everything is done great A screw was bent so our bifold door wouldnt close He repaired that first When putting the oak casing around the outside edges of the doors and drawers of our outdated bathroom vanity he mitered the corners matched up the decorative design of the wood perfectly at the corners took extra time to sand down the outside edges so the edges were perfectly flat used wood filler where needed at the mitered corners When cutting the plastic trellis material for me he was very patient so he would get all the different sizes I wanted
4,I was painting the trim on my home when I found an area on the garage where the wood was rotted I placed calls to several handymen services My Handyman returned my call promptly They quoted me a flat halfhourly fee  scheduled a specific datetime for the service They also stated that if I had other jobs that I thought of that needed doing the handyman they sent was mine for the day  I could add these jobs on The man they sent was nice professional  capable of handling the job repairing the garage I had however remembered that my bathtub faucet was leaking  asked him if he could fix that He said he would look at it As he looked at it it became clear to me that plumbing was not one of his skills I later found that he was somewhat new to the company  still learning As the plumbing job was not something I originally asked for I was OK with this I was disappointed though that I was charged for the time he spent looking at  determining he couldnt fix the problem
5,I havent had anymore problems He was courteous and a nice guy
4,Job 1 The tech was professional  eager The office called the nite before the service to verify the details  to ask if there was anything to add We did add to  it was added to the work order  finished Job 2 Amy at the office was very responsive to my request for an appt since the days I was available to have this work done was very limited She called me bk after an opening which was right for me They arrived on time The shower in the basement had a plugged part which would ve to be replace Brian left to buy a replacement but discovered it would ve to be ordered He suggested 2 options ordering the piece  coming back abt a wk later or buy a whole new valve cost app the same amount  replace that day I decided to have him resemble the shower  leave it wout doing either since it is not the main broom Brian was careful to subtract time that took him to drive  get a replacement washer for outside faucet Work took 4 12 hrs at 76 per hr which added up fast
5,I was very happy with the quality of workmanship that was performed and promptness of arrival He was very willing and able to take care of the miscellaneous tasks that needed attention I will use them again
3,Randy was late the first day seemed courteous enough but ill prepared to perform task Second day was on time was courteous but again ill prepared for tasks and made numerous trips to his truck for tools he should have taken with him the first trip Work completed was done well but feel the cost was out of line with the amount of work
5,On time polite communicated clearly explained his work plan completely gave us options when able Had trouble reaching company after hours  we are only home in the evenings we had to leave 3 messages before the company actually called back  this may have been an answering service issue
5,They were very responsive at returning our call and coming out to do the work They came back free of charge to make some adjustments to a lock that was installed We were very satisfied with the work
5,THEY REALLY WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO ACCOMMODATE MY NEED FOR A FAST APPOINTMENT I WAS RELOCATING AND HAD TO GET THE WORK FINISHED IN ORDER TO LIST MY HOUSE FOR SALE I CALLED LATE IN THE AFTERNOON AND THE HANDYMAN WAS THERE THE NEXT DAY THE WORK WAS EXCELLENT
5,WHAT I LIKED ABOUT HOW HE WORKED IS THAT HE WOULD MAKE CERTAIN TO HAVE ACCURACY IN PLACING THE ITEMS WHERE I WANTED THEM PLACED WHEN HE WAS DONE HE ASKED IF I NEEDED ANYTHING ELSE DONE AND HE DID SOME ADDITIONAL CHORES FOR ME I WAS TOLD WHAT THEIR RATES WERE BEFORE THEY STARTED AND I THOUGHT IT WAS EXPENSIVE AND I WAS GLAD TO HAVE IT DONE
5,MY HANDYMAN CHIP IS A PERFECTIONIST WHEN I SCHEDULE HIM FOR WORK I KNOW THE FINISHED REPAIR WORK WILL LOOK NEW THE OWNER SOMETIMES STOPS BY TO SEE HOW THINGS ARE GOING THE COMPANY IS VERY FOCUSED TOWARDS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
5,Polite courteous on time very helpful and knowledgeable Excellent
5,They are not real cheap and I have used them about three times now They really know how to problem solve and all the people I have worked with have been very knowledgeable They have a service call charge a trip charge cost per hour and cost of materials If you want the quality sometimes you have to pay the price I would hire them again They do not make excuses and I have never had to have them come back to fix something
5,THE HANDY MAN WAS ONTIME AND DID AN EXCELLENT JOB REPAIRING THE DAMAGE HE LEFT JOB SITE NEAT AND TOOK PRIDE IN HIS WORK
3,I TOLD HIM THAT MY SPECIFICATIONS MUST BE TO VA STANDARDS HE SAID THAT HE GOES BY THE STATE STANDARDS I FELT LIKE I SHOULDNT HAVE TO ARGUE THIS POINT I JUST WANTED AN ESTIMATE BASED ON MY SPECIFICATIONS HE DIDNT ITEMIZE OR GIVE ME A DRAWING OF THE ITEMS THE WAY THAT I NEEDED HIS PRICING I FELT WAS VERY HIGH
5,Everything went great

5,THIS COMPANY WAS VERY PROMPT IN RESPONDING AND INSTALLING OUR NEW STORM DOORS THE INSTALLER WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND DID AN EXEMPLARY JOB WE WOULD HIRE THEM AGAIN AND NO DOUBT WE WILL

5,It went very well It was a challenging job due to exposed stone work on one wall and fluted antique wood paneling on other walls
5,they did excellant work in record time i am very very happy
2,It took a bit of time for them to get the job together but eventually it was done adequately The job was performed in August of 2019 and it cost me 425 Now 7 months later my masonry work is coming apart and cracking in spots again For 425 I would expect the job to last longer I called last week and talked to J R  and he said they would get back to me So far NADA If this wasnt their area of expertise they should have said so and I would have hired someone whose it was
5,Outstanding customer service Expectations were exceeded
5,Being done this day
5,Great I highly recommend Lendahandhandyman
2,The floors they done were done good  but they took the paint job also not a professional look
5,Excellent Service I definitely will use them again
4,Was told to have mirror cut down but if they had measured the counter top I w not have to Cost 25 and mirror looks terrible where placed
4,The work of the Handyman was great
2,Workmanship was shoddy They damaged the door they were installing They damaged the handrail on the steps The door still doesnt close right
1,Top to bottom the worst handyman experience of my life Simple tv hang turned into property damage and a 1 hour job took 4 It was bad They didnt measure or plan just kept drilling holes 14 holes for 4 bolts and winging it Laughed off my concerns Scratched my floors I told them up front Im a renter and to be very carefulthey promised they would and thenyeah Dont hire these guys
4,good job and I was happy with the work performance
5,Did a excellent job
5,It took them a little while but they were very very good I was really impressed with the tile work
5,It was excellent they showed up excellent work and cleaned up before they left
5,Tony was prompt and friendly Screen looks great
5,Great The Team at Louisville Handyman listened to requested and communicated during the projects They really did a great job delivering quality work
5,Every aspect of the job Professional from start to finish
5,Louisville Handyman and Remodeling wont be the cheapest estimate you get but the quality and thoroughness of the work performed as well as the care given to make sure you are satisfied with the final product is what the standard for all other contractors should be At every step of the process we were well informed ahead of time what was going to happen what was to be expected and when it was estimated to be finished The work on my kitchen was amazing and thorough as the technician Brian took great pride in the quality of his work I am already inquiring about work I want done in another room in my home
1,It still has not been done Two scheduled appointments have been delayed and now they cant find anyone to do it within a reasonable time I shall never use Handyman Connection nor Angies List again
1,Talked with owners son and he conveyed that he did not have schedule in front of him and he would call me back in 5 minutesNEVR heard back bush league company
5,Sam was very polite and professional He did a fantastic job Our front door trim now looks like new Great job
5,Louisville Handyman March 2018 I was very pleased with the work that Louisville Handyman performed March 2018 I had multiple small to medium sized jobs around the house All were challenging I worked c Sam W and I found him to be not only competent but skillful He anticipated and maneuvered past the obstacles that had frustrated me The price was reasonable for what he did I considered it a high quality job My motto has always been Quality is rarely cheap but it is almost always a good value Sam did very good quality work at a reasonable price Sam is also courteous and friendly and easy to work with Tony Duncan
5,All work performed was excellent but it was pricey
5,From the initial call to schedule an estimate to the finished job everything was just outstanding with this company Eric was our estimator and came out about 2 weeks after my initial call they are pretty booked up which I can see why He was on time very professional talked us through all of the issues we were inquiring about After we received the estimate and scheduled the service about a week later we had Billy do the repairs Super nice guy always showed up on time and the door looks great I gave the pricing a B only because we had two other estimates that were lower but in this case you get what you pay for I will definitely be using this company again and highly recommend to anyone
4,I had them out for a quote but I didnt use them I asked them for a bathroom and basement refinish They seemed fine I didnt go with them though The customer service was fine I found better options
1,The woman I spoke with over the phone was very rude and unprofessional and their prices were outrageous
5,I got an estimate on one day and was scheduled quickly The technician was nice and very efficient He got the job done quickly and neatly
5,Beautiful Work The repairs looked better than the original Louisville Handyman was great to work with Professional ontime work was delivered as agreed and price was reasonable Still hard to believe that they sent a crew on such short notice when the front door was smashed in and could not be locked
5,Overall it was a pleasant and professional experience
5,Excellent contractor All work was completed within schedule and budget Some project creep that was my fault not theirs did come up and they rolled with it perfectly Will be hiring these guys again
4,The work LH provided was very high quality A true craftsman was assigned to our job His skills were above and beyond as was his demeanor He showed great respect for the customer and hisher property keen attention to detail excellent craftsmanship If you want a craftsman to complete your project you would need to request this one by name We believe the work was as good as is available for the work performed If you have the ability to pay the higher prices LH charges and you get their most skilled craftsman you will likely be very satisfied The project exceeded the estimated time it would take to complete by 68 weeks Initially receiving a whirlpool tub that would not install in the space was partially to blame Waited on subs created additional extension of the project Bathroom cabinetry was also made by superior craftsmen a sub initial cabinetry was delivered with the wrong doors and drawers which was remedied  it took about 3 additional weeks for new cabinetry to be delivered Subs damaged one brand new cabinet door minimally LH made an aesthetic repair but didnt offer replacement Bath tub was minimally cracked at base not affecting operation but still cracked mostly likely by subs who installed LH had the tub repaired by a manufacturers authorized person and extended the warranty for two years Cost was at least 25 over bid cost most increases were do to customers upgrades other additional costs were hidden in billing Sometimes an answer was provided regarding charges other times an acceptable answer wasnt provided I would hire LH again if my budget allowed
3,Basement was finished on time price seemed a little high There were some mistakes made when a new copy of the blue print was not given before the work was started Starting to see nail marks on the ceiling and had to have them comeback and push the carpet back under the wall in some places My job wasnt the biggest so I didnt always feel valued as a customer I would use again but only after shopping around and seeing my options Outside of the doors and wood work every thing else is contracted out
5,After reviewing work we hired him to paint interior of house repair deck and stain deck build hand rails in garage and on deck Slava also repaired front door and painted it
5,They did not charge me for a quote I did not have them do they project as the price was to high I did not want to over improve for our neighborhood I would love to use them I wish I could justify the expense
5,I couldnt be more pleased with the punctuality and professionalism Mike introduced himself and explained what he had done when he was finished
5,technician discovered that the home builder did not properly vent the exhaust fan but he was able to properly and correctly vent the fan
5,It went great They did a really good job They have good price and good quality
3,It was not very well They wanted 11000 for a 4000 job They showed up when they were supposed to show up They were on time
3,The fixtures and trash drawer were installed
5,Sam arrived on time and was very professional and efficient We are very happy with the service performed and with the company We would definitely use them again
1,Eric told me the job would take 68 hours and quoted a price of around 600 and the only way it would be guaranteed is if I had ice guard used I agreed and someone by the name of John came out He spent two hours at my home including a 30 minute break John spent sitting in the van A year and a half later I have water pouring into my bathroom When I contacted Louisville Handyman I was asked to send pictures of inside and outside and then told skylights are always a problem and that I should remove it and board it up I was told I would get a call back to figure out what needed to be done and never received a call I eventually called a roofer and they came out fixed the leak for less money and I havent had a problem since
5,The service was prompt the quality and people were fantastic
5,I had rotten wood around the garage door Since it was outside the company came by while I was away to look at the damage and give a quote on the work They were willing to work with me to get it done quickly and were on time and extremely nice when they arrived We had two gentlemen working for 4 hours They acted professionally and quickly but were still interested in talking like normal people They even offered to bring me back lunch after their lunch break and showed me some good fishing spots The work was beautiful They replaced the rotten wood and aluminum siding around the garage They brought me out to see the area causing the issue explain how they were going to fix it to prevent it from happening again and had no issues with me asking questions I even smeared some of their caulking and they were kind enough to fix it for me  The only iffy part was that they quoted the price in a bid format instead of a quote format I would ask for a quote next time to ensure I pay the actual price for the work not a price based on looking at it for a few minutes
5,It went well Really knew what he was talking about
3,Eric noticed that we had rotted wood around our doors and windows and at the space under my garage door Ive had several people come out and he is the only gentleman who came and did a thorough inspection and he caught it right away I cant begin to tell you how good he is He noticed it along one side and started pressing on the ramping and everything and said it felt crunchy below it He went onto another and pulled it out and all below was rotted wood He said that it was in such bad shape that he might have to jack it up he suggested bringing a contractor out and doing a flat estimate or charging by the hour It will be a very expensive job but he has saved my house and no one else caught it before this Ive had Champion Windows and Cunningham Garage Doors as well as Handy Pro and Bright Pest Control and none of them noticed it even when I pointed out some of the rotted wood to HandyPro Eric from Global Handyman has saved my house I dont know if it was water damage termites or carpenter ants but it has done a number on my home but he caught it and I am so pleased He deserves accolades all around for catching something no one else has found yet He is very professional wellbred and wellmannered I cant say enough about him Hes a good honest man UPDATE When it came to my bill he sent the price of 700 when had the other guy come out Eric came back and said Great you have steel concrete it may not cost as much as I thought Once the bill came it was double He said I hadnt answered his emails and I said I was shocked and didnt know what to say The price was DOUBLE How can he say it will be cheaper and then double it
5,The person that came out and did the estimate was absolutely accurate as far as the time and the cost The job the gentleman did was high quality
4,Gutter vendor did ok job but left after job and never allowed us time to inspect Garage vendor was good and professional but work done was less than what we expected Patio vendor was very good
3,Very responsive and on time appointment for quote They wanted a 50 percent deposit for minor repair handyman type work I felt uncomfortable with this way of doing business Too much risk for the customer If high dollar parts were involved then maybe
2,We were charged almost 300 to reattach a piece of trim that had come away from the brick siding near the peak of our house Mike showed up on time and after some time trying to figure out how to do this he made a trip to the store for supplies that he did not have on his van He reattached the trim using some caulk and 4 tap con screws that he had to go get from the store For that effort we were charged almost 300 He was very personable however my wife and I could not believe that he didnt have the necessary items on board and that we were charged for him to go to the store Not only was the cost of the supplies outrageous so was the rate we were charged We will not be using this company again for other projects we have and I will not be recommending them to others as well
5,This company is responsive quick and will follow up if I have any questions after the job Their workmanship is thorough and professional
5,Eric was punctual friendly and knowledgeable He said that Sam was the guy for the job Sam was right on time very professional and a nice The wood beneath the stained glass had rotted being quite old and the window had slipped down a few inches leaving a gap at the top Sam removed the old wood and the window and showed me how to clean the window of the gunk it had collected using a razor blade tool he provided After rebuilding the window frame with new wood he added a layer of glass to provide further insulation and to protect the stained glass The finished product is just beautiful I couldnt be happier Also he loaned me some wood glue to fix a broken chair and added a vice tool to hold the wood in place while it dried I honestly have no idea whether the price was good or not since Ive never had that type of work down before But regardless I would hire them again
5,It went well He was a little difficult to schedule with as he was so slammed with Angies list
5,Great to work with Punctual Fast work and well done Very good at correcting my mistakes
4,people doing the work are very good and profession our only criticism is the price charged is very high Louisville handyman takes a higher margin for subcontracting the work than most companies we will not be using them again
4,The quality of the work was very good and on par or better than the existing construction on our 67 year old 4000 sf home We were especially pleased with the quality of work with regards to custom wood trim The employees of Louisville Handyman were professional and communicated well regarding any problems or changes that had to be made during the work LH contracted the paint and drywall work It took a lot of effort from us to get the custom finish the way that we wanted in the bar area and there was some drywall work done that was not completed to our satisfaction that had to be redone I am very happy overall with the quality of the work The price was fair but was not cheap You get what you pay for However I would say that for the money I should not have had to work as hard as I did to get the contracted work completed to our sastisfaction The owner of the company was not as responsive as he could have been forcing me to follow up on issues instead of taking care of them himself I expected LH to be all over any issues and that wasnt always the case That aspect of the project could have been better I would still recommend the company especially the work of the employees of LH They are true craftsmen
5,I have used Lvl Handyman for several years and have complete confidence in their talents workmanship professionalism and results
5,Arrived as scheduled and completed repairs in two days with a high degree of professionalism Job went smoothly Doors work like like new and leak appears to be fixed
5,Louisville Handymans office was easy to deal with set a scheduled date  time that worked for me John the seviceman showed up went right to work  had the job taken care of very quickly He looked ed at other repairs that he assured me could be taked care of which I will be scheduling shortly Good company
5,Joe came out to give a free estimate to screen in a porch that required two sides to be screened His estimate was 2500 to complete this job He was very friendly and seemed knowledgeable and came up with some good ideas on how to handle the work However we did not choose him to do this project due to the price I guess as a first time homeowner I sometimes get sticker shock
5,Joe was very particular with all details He even had the carpet removed to prevent it from being damaged He was careful which subcontractors he used to cut the the hole in the basement wall Gas and water lines had to be rerouted in order to dig the hole for the egress window
5,They did a really good job We had a problem with out back door where water starts standing and it rotted the wood around the door frame they replaced it It seems to be expensive but they did it correctly They used the proper wood for weather Weve been very happy with their work
5,A frozen bathtub pipe burst during the first polar vortex The bathroom and adjoining closet and bedroom had always been cold in the winter and hot in the summer The plumber who fixed the pipe suggested we look into additional insulation for the wall around the pipe and in the ceiling over the tub We called Louisville Handyman because our pipes to the bathroom had frozen again after repair of the broken one Craig from Louisville Handyman came out the next morning and quickly added the insulation He had loaded everything he needed on the truck for the service run He was friendly professional and efficient We quickly felt the improvement in the temperature of the bath and adjoining rooms after the improved insulation and are ready now for the next polar vortex round of freezing temperatures Craig and Louisville Handyman gave us our peace of mind back since we had taken turns throughout the day and night blowing a hairdryer over the frozen pipes to prevent another broken pipe until the insulation could be added We will use Louisville Handyman again
5,They did a great job and they are professional They called and showed up on time and did everything they said they would do
5,The provider Sam was on time and very neat What looked like a simple cutout turned out to be anything but simple The original cabinetry had been custom built around the cooktopstove leaving a nonstandard space for a standard sized gas range Sam expertly reengineered my cabinet in order to shave the half inch necessary to make the range fit I had thought I was going to lose the functionality of a drawer and a shelf in my cabinet but he not only spared the drawer but he expertly resized the shelf in my cabinet to accommodate the half inch he took off When you look in the cabinet in question you cannot tell he was even there He was quick precise and very clean As I learned during the time he was here he is the one Lowes and Home Depot refer customers to who realize their new appliances dont fit when they get them home Sams carpentry work was amazing I look forward to using him and Louisville Handyman for my future remodeling and handyman needs
5,Results were dramatic Eric Thornton has genuine talent I had a list of improvements I wanted for the kitchen but Eric supplied the vision I didnt want to overspend on this small house and he made recommendations In keeping with the budget I wanted to use Greg Bilyeu for painting the room and cabinets and Son of a Carpenter for the flooring and Eric made all the timing work I was very busy with a renovation at work so my home project was not my top priority but Eric did not let that impact the necessary communication We texted and messaged quite a bit which I appreciate Ill let the photos say the rest
5,Everything done to high standards Excellent workmanship
4,I spoke with the owner at a home remodeling and lawngardening show I had noted their presence at several shows which to me was a good sign of the companys potential for good work i spoke with the owner over lunch at the show and had intended to explore further the 3 projects I had in mind bathroom remodel kitchen remodel and construction of a 2000 sq ft shopgaragestorage building However after discussion I felt that the building construction might be beyond the scope of this contractor so I decided to look elsewhere It wasnt anything that the owner said or didnt say just a feeling on my part In the future if I have need of a contractor for a remodeling project I will certainly give Louisville Handyman Inc another look
3,They were expensive The quality of work was okay
3,I did not use this company
5,Perfect experience Reasonably priced
2,Called Louisville Handyman to make a small repair to a few pieces of vinyl siding that were coming Repairs were requested due to home inspection of house pending sale Person who came out said we also needed several other areas repaired We said no only fix what was noted on home inspection Once on the ladder he said the siding in question was not installed correctly and that he would need additional parts and labor to fix We again said no only fix what was noted He grudgingly complied saying without the extra parts and labor he would not guarantee the work I called the builder Ball Homes and they dispute the claims made by Louisville Handyman
5,It went superb I have been out of reach for about a month due to personal reasons and he called me back to check up on me He went above and beyond the call of duty
4,They showed up on time and did what they said they were going to do Their prices also stayed the same as their quote but they might have been a little high
5,They showed up on time and did a great job under very adverse conditions It was wet and cold They tore off the decking repaired joists and put new decking back on It took 3 days as they promised Cleaned up very well
4,I called the company based on Angies list reviews they were evidently very busy and so even the estimate date was several weeks in the future but that didnt matter The woman I talked to was very polite and precise about dates and making sure we were both on the same page On the estimate date I received a call a little bit before the actual time asking if he could come a little early as he was in the area He arrived promptly I showed him what needed to be donea wooden awning had the spokes on one side starting to bow out in an unstable fashion and some wooden soffits on the front porch had some slats that were starting to sag I thought the wood was rotten and would need replacing but he said not He said it looked like a couple hours work He was very pleasant and professional and the whole thing took less than ten minutes The estimate was 390 which seemed a little high but at the time I thought it included some painting of the areas I found out later I had mistaken something he said but this was not a big deal as I can paint things myself I agreed and we set up a time for the following week Again the man who showed up not the estimator came on time and was very pleasant and as far as I know did the work competently the awning spokes are back in line anyway The thing that bothered me was that it turned out the materials for the job seemed to consists of some screws or nails maybe and caulk and it took him less than 45 minutes In light of this the estimate seemed to me so expensive that though I went ahead and paid it without saying anything I eventually emailed the company to let them know what I thought and received back a prompt reply explaining how this was a perfectly reasonable price but offering me either a 75 refund or 150 off my next project which I had asked them to estimate before the original one had been completed I chose the 75 since I had decided to cancel the other project and this brought my closing cost down to the 31500 listed elsewhere My dismay at the cost may have been in part because I have been spoiled by jobs done by my previous carpenter who worked only for himself and thus had I suppose fewer expenses and could afford to charge 350 for a job that took him most of the day and used considerably more materials Howard why oh why did you have to move to CO In summary Louisville Handyman is a very well run company with great communication skills responsiveness and punctuality but in this economy I personally need a better hourly rate
4,I think they would have done a good job but I did not go with them The person who came was very professional At that time I just felt that their bid was a little higher But after having the work done I thought that their prices were probably very realistic I would rate them very highly as far as their promptness and professionalism based only on the quote experience I had with them
4,Used Josh and his service for a couple of small repairs and a door installation He did a through job on each task and did not cut corners Had a minor issue with the finish on a door installation but he came back promptly and made corrections I would recommend him for any small handyman work or repairs
4,The price was reasonable It was a good experience The service was good It was really really fast I am pleased
2,It was a bad meeting the job would have not bee done by this company I got someone else to put in my door
5,I had ideas about what I wanted and the people where eager to listen to what I wanted when I wasnt sure which way to turn they had lots of ideas to help me sort it all out I worked with Angela cabinets Dixie flooring and Mike appliances and they were all extremely knowledgeable and patient It took a while about 2 months and I hated living without a kitchen for all that time but I understand that is pretty much standard When it was all over I definitely felt it was worth it
5,He was on time I bought all the fixtures and had them all ready so he didnt have to go to get parts He showed up and did the work
5,I needed an estimate for a bathroom remodel that was already half finished but abandoned This company was prompt and professional and upfront about the challenges and cost of finishing work started by others Although I did not hire this company for this project I felt confident about the details and price of their quote and would seek quotes on future projects
5,Josh began by doing several small handyman jobs for me He does good work his prices are fair and hes trust worthy My house needed painting and he bid on that and gave me a very fair price His crew was very neat and Im very pleased with the whole paint job So when there is anything I need done at my house whatever size job  Josh is the man
5,Their people were really professional friendly and nice The only thing I didnt like was when I had them first out there was that they didnt actually get up on the roof to look around We had already been up there and I kind of told them different things that were wrong I didnt like the idea that they didnt get up there and look for themselves That was the only thing I didnt like I think overall they were nice
5,He is wonderful the most wonderful contractor in the world He did more in one day than some of these others do in a whole year They always walked out before the job was done He is the one I dont think I will ever need another He is too good I have been taken by so many other people thats why I like Angies List
4,First man came out to my moms house to find out the problem No one got on the roof to look around he was just going by what I told him They emailed out a quote which I accepted and was asked to give half down Then we scheduled an appointment which was very timely The handyman that came was very pleasant and did a great job but going back to what I said about no one getting on the roof they missed a vent pipe But it turned out fine they sent another truck out with the extra part i was very happy with this company and would use them again
5,Excellent Identified further issues and project completed on time and on estimate Look forward to working with them again
5,He arrived on time Quickly assessed the need and completed the work Also wanted him to do small plumbing job but he said he could not do it
4,He came out a couple of years ago to give me a quote but I thought it was too high I really didnt have any opinion either way the reason I didnt choose him was because he was too high
4,The service sent out a man who was extremely nice and very prompt he complimented my work but ended up having to take down most of the drywall to fix the seams His work was excellent however since it was only a 2 by 14 section and I had all the materials and had performed all the demo and structure build looking back I cant see why it cost 600 Ive recently had some work performed by another company that involved a major gut and redrywall and their prices were far better then this cost was He was very prompt he even showed up one morning when the roads had ice on them and many businesses and schools were closed He parked his van in my driveway and when he stepped out and closed the door the van actually slid out of the driveway into the road it was bad but he was not only prompt he was about 15 minutes early He seemed to really care about his work
5,They make you pay for a full hour of 110 before they would even come out and then it was 70 after that They will do just about anything for that price I had him look at remaking my banister in the house I had this particular gentleman come in and do it another time because he is very busy with the electrical but he does that too I think he is really great His is really painless service just one person because he is good I think they are kind of expensive I have already used them before and will use them in the future
5,They were great and did it in half an hour He spoke to his boss to help reduce the price
5,Crew did a thorough job on the repairWhen they came for the first visit they advised that the area had not completely dried and suggested holding off on the repair for a week to allow an remaining moisture to dry out When they returned they were able to coordinate all of the work between drywall and painting in a narrow window of time
5,They were prompt punctual responsive and got the job done efficiently We were very pleased with their level of professionalism and expertise
5,They were very professional They set up an appointment and were on time It went well Their estimate was pretty high I would use them in the future
5,We ended up not using this company as we did some of the work ourselves but I was very impressed by this companys response the professional contract and estimate and most of all by the followup calls to see if we had the work completed andor if we had any other needs or questions about the remodel work that we did
1,The response to my request for an estimate was initially very good I received a call and the handyman showed up on time My son talked to him about what needed to be done My son said the gentleman was very polite and seemed very professional The handyman told my son that an estimate would be emailed to me in a few days Never received an email or an estimate and never heard from him again
3,I was called at 1 pm and told Louisville Handyman Incwas running late for my 1230100 appointment for an estimate of deck installroofdoor replacement We discussed him coming later that afternoon but was unable to set a time due to his schedule and mine This was ok and I said we can make appointment another day Then the odd thing was he asked if I had other estimates already We reviewed the work I needed done He said he asked because his company would probably not be comparable to the other estimates If I understood correctly there was a set 635day plus 75hr Being on a fixed income and theeconomy cost was of course a major factor I told him that seemed very high and he said it was due to the number of workers on the job and what they were paid gas prices and length of time on the job I thanked him for his time and told him I would not be needing his services
5,Appointment made over the telephone The service person Sam arrived on the exact time and date He did an excellent replacement of the damaged drywall Once compound was applied and dried He painted the area and it is now impossible to tell where the repair was made He cleaned up his work area was very thorough and professional We will continue to use this company in the future
5,After we agreed to the price the planning began From the start date everyone involved showed up exactly when they said they would All of the work was completed as planned Eric was involved from the beginning to make sure all was on schedule and that there were no problems I could call Eric at any time with questions or concerns and he was very responsive and always went out of his way to make sure that we were pleased The main person working on our kitchen Philip was an excellent carpenter and very skilled at all that he did He was pleasant to have in our home and my children loved having him there From start to finish they got the job done quickly and with quality Couldnt have gone any better I will use them again on our next project I have a beautiful kitchen and am very pleased
5,There were some leaking pipes They fixed that leak and cut some holes in the wall and patch them up The guy that came to do the job was really nice He did a great job The work he did looks good I felt they were a little expensive based on another quote we got I will consider using them in the future again
5,Great experience I have now used Louisville Handyman three times I have always had prompt and professional service Would definitely recommend this company and I will use them again
5,Louisville Handyman was extremely professional yet wonderfully personable I definitely got my moneys worth Im a very inexperienced homeowner had just moved to a new town and had a long list of little things from the home inspection report Eric Thornton the estimator was terrific He helped me prioritize the home inspection items and had some really helpful suggestions His empathy far exceeded my expectations and he was genuinely friendly toward my dogs After his visit we communicated very effectively by email My projects were scheduled about a month after Erics visit which didnt meet my expectations but I can easily see why their services are in demand They pride themselves on the knowledge and experience of their professionals so they are selective about who they add to the teamalso obvious to me now On the first morning of my twoday project Sam arrived on time was very thorough discussing his plan for my closet asked plenty of questions about my needs and also was genuinely patient meeting my barking dogs He offered to let them out during the day assured me he would be very careful they wouldnt get out except into their fenced yard When I arrived home everything was in order and my closet was AMAZING I instantly realized that I had been in the presence of carpentry greatness that morning and had hardly challenged Sams abilities at all When Sam returned the next morningagain promptlywe admired the closet together he seemed pleased that it meets my needs We discussed some projects I would complete on my own and he made product recommendations and suggestions Sam had warned me that I needed to try to add more tasks to my list than he could complete in a day in order make the most of my time I was so happy to find how many things he was able to accomplish and the attention to detail throughout I will use them again without hesitation and am actively working to dreamup carpentry projects for Sam
1,I did not appreciate the extreme price they quoted me
5,They were good but were on the expensive side I may use their services in the future
5,He did the work in the most costeffective way possible He was very good and very reasonably priced I was expecting a much bigger deal He came up with a good common sense and effective solution I like his service and the way he operates He tries to the best of his ability to give his honest opinion Hes an excellent carpenter who uses his time efficiently I loved him I would use him again
5,He did an excellent job I had no complaints I didnt price anywhere else I just wanted it done He was very responsive and came at the time he said he would He was very professional I would absolutely use him again
5,I have used them in the past They are excellent I would not hesitate to use them again They were prompt and gave reasonable bids They were generally able to stay within their bid amount They do high quality work
5,It entailed a lot of work and it was a good quote We just didnt use their services Just by talking to them and having them come out to my house and give me an estimate they were very professional If I could have afforded the quote I would have used them They were too expensive They have a really good reputation as far as I could tell from Angies List and just from other sources around here They were very responsive Actually the president of the company came out and did the quote for me I was very impressed with what I saw of them They had 3 of their top guys come out and examine my house and what I was asking to have done They called back to me within 3 days of being at my house If I could afford them I would use them in the future
3,Came and gave an estimatearrived when stated I mailed a deposit in and set appointment time for work Handyman arrived without supplies he needed Went shopping for light and stucco mix got wrong kind of mix Installed light and went to get correct mix When he got back it was to late and was starting to rain Said he would be back Ten days or more later after some calls to see where he was he returned and finished the job His work was good I asked how much I owed and he gave me a total and I wrote a check for balance due A month later I received a bill for almost double what I had written the check for when I called the office and spoke to Brian he said he would check with the person who did the work and find out about the check I had written that had not been deposited Two weeks later I call again as I hadnt heard from Brian He stated he had paperwork in front of him and would get right back with me Four days later Brian called and wanted me to stop payment on check and issue a new one which I immediately did I ask Brian why the handyman had not came with supplies he needed and why he wanted to charge me for hours he used while shopping Estimate said for time and supplies I thought that was for time worked The check was for original total the handyman had said was balance in full I think their estimate needs to clarify the terms more clearly They give a bid for a specific job and should come prepared to do that job
5,Excellent  Dan looked at all of the jobs and determined which tools to bring in from the truck and the order in which to do all jobs He was very efficient and professional
5,Very well When I called I was promptly given an estimate in this case time and materials and a date for the work to be performed The repairman showed up promptly worked quickly and efficiently He did a very high quality job and cleaned up when he was done
1,No one ever came
5,The handyman did an excellent job
5,Can not tell it was ever there
5,It went very well
3,Didnt use
5,Great as always
3,The bookshelves were built to our satisfaction The work was of very good quality The craftsmen were polite and efficient Unfortunately they spilled oil based paint in our driveway at the beginning of the job The stain was finally removed after 6 months had elapsed They attempted to clean it with chemical methods all of which failed and killed some new sod to boot Eventually a light sand blast was required to remove the stain I feel the response to this was extremely poor It should have been addressed immediately after the spill not 6 months later and a few calls to prod them to do it
5,THEY WERE PROMPT POLITE AND EASY TO WORK WITH THEY DID A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS WHILE THEY WERE THERE AND THEY WORKED VERY QUICKLY IN THE TIME THAT THEY WERE THERE
2,I cant recommend them
4,They were good
3,NO est no work
5,They performed the work just fine
5,great
5,He is reliable he is prompt He is cooperative to add a project that originally not on the list He is fun to work with He is flexible and agreeable His talent are diverse His pricing reasonable I would recommend him without hesitation
5,Great Very professional and prompt
4,Could have been better really should not have taken 3 days
5,Mr Hammond and his employee were very professional We had them install siding and windows and then had them do some drywall and trim work We were on vacation Mr Hammonds work exceeded our expectations work and cleanup were done when we got home Would definitely hire him again
1,call did not go through Cant say I would hire again never got to hire them the first time I called Takl
3,Declined to do concrete work though they replied to my request promptly
5,Excellent job will definitely use them again
5,Mr Hammond and his assistant stayed focused on their work but were friendly and helpful They cleaned up after their work and left the house as they found it but better I will definitely call on Mr Hammond for my next jobs
1,Took several days to call me then came out to give me a quote but said he would have to email it to me in the next few days Ive never had anyone not be able to give me a quote on the spot So seven days later I got the quote  I asked when he would be available to do the work He was supposed to get back to me in a few days again to schedule something for the next week Well its now the end of the next week  I havent heard a thing from him Ive already hired someone else for the job who called me back gave me a quote  came to do the work all within two days
5,Mr Hammond and his assistant did a firstrate job and accommodated my time constraints I thought their price was reasonable The man whom I engaged through Angies list FIRST was a total disappointment He tied up the first day calling at the end of the day He was just there to look over the job He said he would get in touch with me the next dayhis schedule had become to busy to do the work that day He only called me and came after it was dark the next day and he did not seem to know how to do the work He said that an address plaque had to be secured by a bolt that screwed in at two directions He did not center of finish drilling holes He was foulmouth and crude HE said that he would come the next day day 3 He acted like I could drop classes and other obligations for him to come sometime the next day I told him that if he could not get me into his schedule after two days I did not want to wait more time to have the whole thing be bumped into a third day He struck me as being unscrupulous and he talked about bigger jobs being his main consideration because they paid more He was proposing that I set aside a whole third day for him to maybe be able to be there to do the work I said that the arrangement did not suit me He said that I needed to get someone else to do the work then and hung up on me I would NEVER call that man to do work for me He was unreliable crude temperamentally unsuited to deal with people and appeared to be unscrupulous Hanging up on someone who does not let the small job be bumped into a third day was a deal breaker The guys name was Larry and he worked at the Jeff Davis company in southern Indiana which is in southern Indiana Please do not name me as the person who gave him a bad report I found the man scary I would give the man low marks in honesty reliability sociability and knowhow I would never call his company again The review below is for David Hammond the second man whom I called through Angies list did a fine job installing my address plaque and remounting a garage rack I was very accommodating and did a fine job I would call for him again
5,David was very responsive and did a great job I wouldnt hesitate to contact him in the future for larger jobs
5,The work was done well on time professionally at a reasonable cost
5,Always stayed in contact with us always on time and very flexible which was very important
5,Great they were in and out and knew exactly what to do
5,They finished quickly and worked to make sure it was turning out how I envisioned
5,David is a honest and hardworking guy He and a helper did a really good job repairing some rotten trim and soffit painting the exterior wood and installed a new backdoor I purchased at home Depot The price was more than fair and there were no surprises even though the door required more work than expected He always notified me prior to arriving which was nice I appreciate Davids work and will not hesitate to use him again
5,He and his helper were very friendly and considerate they arrived on time and got to work immediately They were knowledgeable and exacting We thought it was charming that David whistled while he was working He knows his stuff Was a perfectly perfect experience and I couldnt be happier We will definitely use him again
5,Good quality work prompt cleaned up after Friendly and courteous In one instance where mortar was dripped onto the sidewalk he came back with a wire brush to clean it up
5,Great Excellent work restoring our barn and building the large compost bins Very pleasant to work with and work is xcellent
5,Great This was a very small job and they were willing to do it The price was right for the work required
5,I have used We Can Do LLC on several projects over the past few years To date I have never been disappointed with quality nor cost of their services They are polite reliable pay attention to details and pick up after themselves I would recommend them without any reservations
5,Dave arrived on time and began working on the deck Not only did he tear down the deck but also took all the debris with him Job took about 45 hours He did discover that additional wood would be needed for the job due to more extensive wood rot He secured the additional supplies and still finished the job on time as promised The quoted price did go up however even with the increase the price was within our range and the finished product was well constructed
5,I found David Hammonds services We Can Do LLC through Angies List and was very happy with his professionalism and the quality of the work he completed for us Not only was he personable upon first contacting him he happened to be available for an onsite estimate the same day Our front entryway job included drywalling 3 adjacent surfaces retexturing the replaced section of ceiling reframing the door with trim and replacing the entryway ceiling light fixture The project was tidy and completed over two consecutive days despite the drying time for multiple layers of mudding and sanding In addition the end cost matched the initial estimate and though I always got an answering machine when I called David consistently replied within the hour usually within 30 min and communication remained good He came to do the job on the days he said he would and even called on those mornings ahead of arrival Mr Hammond is definitely at the top of our list for our next home repairimprovement job
5,David returned call with a prompt estimate When we decided to go with him he was prompt and reliable He did the work just as he promised and there were zero surprises David performed the type of work you expect from a professional but rarely get these days
5,We have used several handyman services in the past David Hammond is the best of the group He is prompt professional and pleasant Quietly gets the job done and the price is reasonable and fair It is a good feeling to know we have David Hammond when we need a handyman and then some
5,David was very responsive and after the initial estimate he was able to make it out about two weeks later The job lasted 3 days and everything was completed as I had expected This is the second time Ive used him and I will call again if I need anything else done
2,Called twice and never got called back Suck
5,Punctual performed work exactly as agreed nice guys Doors look great
5,The owner David Hammond provided a detailed written estimate of the job After the estimate was accepted we agreed on a time to complete the work David met the schedule He called before his employee and he arrived Both worked steadily to complete the job and were skilled knowledgeable and respectful My husband and I were very happy with the work and would recommend We Can Do to anyone
5,This was new construction a bedroom for our 3 year old grand daughter They worked quickly were fun to have around and never minded that they were under the watchful eye of a three year old supervisor Great work careful cleanup
5,David was pleasant to work with and did an excellent job on screening in our patio
5,They came out the day that I called They contacted me one hour before they arrived Cleaned up there mess and gave me an approximate coat before they arrived I will definitely contact this company again
5,This was the second time we used Mr Hammonds services The first time was to remodle an old bathroom that required a replacement bathtub and shower sink new tile floor exhaust fan and replastering Our experience this time around with Mr Hammond was no less favorable than the first one He proved himself to be a courteous and experienced professional in his line of work On a couple of occasions he made suggestions that saved us time or money toward the completion of the project He also took pains to keep the dust level in the house to a minimum Should we need the services of a skilled handyman in the future Mr Hammond would be the first person I would call On both occasions he did a great job for us
5,David of We Can Do LLC arrived precisely ontime Appeared he had all the materials and tools needed from his previous estimate David carefully moved our clothes dryer closer to the exterior vent and he explained why  a shorter vent pipe means less lint thereby reducing fire hazard He removed the old 15foot long vent aluminized plastic and replaced it with corrugated aluminum  greatly improving the fire resistance Surprisingly he also used brackets instead of spring clamps to attach the new vent pipe to the dryer and the exhaust He explained this should solve the problem we had with the old vent piping disconnecting from the dryer due to vibrations Overall most pleased We Can Do is slightly more expensive than other handyman services However David listened to my concerns and needs solved each one and explained what and why he did something
3,They returned a phone call to came to give an estimate promptly The job was 650 which sounded a bit high but I just wanted it done and quickly so I could get everything put back together They told me that they thought they would be able to do the work the next week Then it turned out to be the next week then the next I had to call them to find out about the rescheduling In the meantime they did give me the name of another person to do some other work around my house that I needed done that they didnt do I called him and he came and gave me estimates one them was for some of the same work and it was literally 12 the priceto remove and replace 6 planks on my front porchdeck We Can Do gave me an estimate of 120 the other guy 60 The new guy did that job fortunately but drywall wasnt his area Anyway the drywall was done done promptly and done well when they came They were there each day it had to dry after each day first thing in the morning and called each time to say they were on their way Again their drywall was good However in the iiving room they pulled up the carpet tack strip to take out or replace Im not sure which the drywall and when they did it left big holesdivits in the concrete When we called them about it they did come back to repair them but they said that they thought that when the carpeting people came to lay the carpeting back down they figured that they would fix it It was fixed but David didnt seem happy about making the trip to do so Im not too picky I mean I am its my house but the little details can impress or unimpress me Like they didnt fix the concrete they didnt put outlet covers back on the walls I had to touch up paint where they didnt when they put the trim back up in the living room
4,He Informed me that he doesnt do work in the Old Louisville Area This is neither a positive or negative review just informational
5,The work went well he was on time neat  everything was done professionally He brought the necessary trim  matching paint  the garage doors look great The faucet works well no drips or leaks Im going to be using his service in the future
5,Everything they did was very good
1,We chose We Can Do depending on the Angies List ratings I called and left a message several days passed and he called and left a message I called and left a message several days passed and he called and left a message I called to respond and could not leave a message I understand being busy However not even responding to a possible client or making an attempt is not professional
4,Response took a few days I wanted laminate flooring installed They dont do this type of work
5,They were very dependable They did high quality work Scheduling was kind of slow but they would call and check in with me
5,Scheduled appt and repairs were done quickly and for the price agreed to
5,He was there when he said he would be He finished when he said he would The job was great he cleaned up after himself and was very forthright with his communications a great experience which does not happen often I WILL use him again
5,I found We Can Do through Angies Big Deal and things have turned out really great Following a call to explain and arrange a time David came and estimated how long it would take the deal was for two man hours of work and then has come back to patch the walls David is still going to come back one more time and sand and then paint the repairs being made but has been waiting on me to get the matching paint Hes been very friendly yet professional and excellent with communication That is something that often frustrates me with contractors  not communicating when they can arrive or following up with return calls That hasnt been a problem at all with We Can Do Pending the outcome of the sanding and painting I am definitely planning to use them again when I need handyman work done I especially also appreciate that hes been willing to make three separate trips  the 2nd one was to cut out small pieces of the walls that had been repaired so I could get an accurate paint match for the discounted work
5,David was prompt to show when he came for the estimate Initially we were just going to do the deck doors the seal was broken on one but I also got an estimate to enclose the bottom of the deck He had an excellent idea to use T111 wood siding which we will stain in the springa much cheaper alternative that hadnt occurred to us He and his partnerhelper did a great job were kind and considerate the entire time cleaned up after themselves and could not have been any better We intend to call David again when we need a handyman I highly recommend him
5,David was good about calling when he was on his way to my house Since he is only about 15 minutes away this was very helpful He was careful about covering the surrounding areas with drop cloths before beginning the sanding Tthe job was finished to my complete satisfaction David was professional attentive to details and pleasant to work with He made friends with my dog who was always happy to see him arrive I will definitely call upon him in the future
5,Great experience will use We Can Do againPrompt and courteous Always called before coming over Very satisfied
5,He and his helper were very friendly and did a good job I had a problem about a week later with one of the door knobs and he came out the same day and fixed it immediately Then I had a question about something else and called him and he responded the same day answered my question and was very professional
5,Our bathroom upstairs had a leaking and stained the ceiling over the kitchen area So we wanted to have it repainted I have tried a few handymen and neither wanted to take the job because it was a small job and required multiple trips Dave gladly accepted it and did a wonderful job
4,David was reliable and good to work with We went back and forth on ideas about completing the project and he was patient through the process and did a good job
5,All services were performed in a timely manner with very professional personnel David was very fast and courteous as was his helper I will use them again as things arise in the house
5,Fantastic Easy to schedule Easy to work with Nice job done reasonable rates Will gladly work with again
5,David did a fantastic job  we couldnt be more pleased He was hardworking and honest in his dealings He did a lot of work in a short period of time Im certain we would have paid twice as much with a different provider He took on our BIG problems with ease and make them look like small issues We will definitely use him again as we need other things done around the house
5,David called soon after I purchased the coupon from Angies List and scheduled a time to come and see what I needed done He took all the measurements for purchasing and installing a banister to my basement on a concrete wall He returned about a week later and completed the work in about 45 minutes I am beyond pleased with the job he did
5,The contractor was very efficient in attempting to fix the existing fixture After determining that we would need a replacement we were able to find the same model at Home Depot Mr Hammond responded very quickly in another trip to our home to install the new fixtureWe were very pleased with the response time and the effort made to fix the old fixture
5,I have several rental properties and David has done several projects for me He does a very good job  is always professional I know I can trust him to get the job doe correctly the first time without any follow up on my part
5,He came and was only here for 1 hr He got everything I needed and is going to come back for the other hour at a later date I really didnt even have to make an appointment with him he was just that prompt
4,We are remodeling a house that we just purchased I called We Can Do and spoke with David Hammond the owner We set up a time for a review for an estimate Well it was about a week later than he said but he came a provided us with an estimate After getting a few other estimates we decided to use We Can Do I had removed most of the wallpaper in the dining room but the drywall was damaged and the wallpaper backing remained The first layers of the drywall came off in places In the kitchen we removed a back splash and it also made a mess of the drywall Same problems in 2 baths David showed up when he said he would and he and his helper worked a very long day that first day While they were working I pointed a few other small drywall problems and asked if they would repair them and move an electrical wire for a light in the pantry They fixed them all They covered the hardwood floors and cleaned up each day They came back 2 more days and finished the work The drywall is ready for priming Even after the extra work they did for me the final bill came in under estimate I would highly recommend them and will use them again if I need any drywall work done Ive got a basement that needs to be finished
1,It took too long to set an appointment to come out and obtain an estimate Finally set an appointment and they came out to look at my house They told me they would have the estimate to me the following Monday but it has now been over a week and a half since they came out and still no estimate
5,David was on time and very professional He worked hard and did very nice work He left the work sight clean I received good value for the money spent I will hire them in the future and I highly recommend them to anyone I have him on speed dial
2,Wanted some dywall repaired Left email and phone messages never recived a call back
5,It went very wellI was so pleased to get this longstanding nuisance taken care of in such a short time I estimate he was here a bit less than an hour He charged by the job not the hour He also gave me some tips on keeping the downspouts clear See  Description of Services Performed for details
5,See above  very professional  courteous
5,David was extremely easy to work with He returned my calls promptly Estimate to completion of job was about two weeks It was a relief to have someone call us back in a timely manner and complete the work We are very pleased with the work he did for us He is very honest and up front about cost and materials needed He even took it upon himself to fix our slamming storm door on his way out Weve already requested him to repair a small crack in one of our exterior columns on the front porch We will definitely use him again Could not be happier
5,David did a wonderful job He arrived when he said he would and was even a day early in one case He did the work even when we were at work He is a really nice and dependable individual We will definitely use him in the future
5,It went great He went over the detailed list identifying those jobs he could do those he could not and those he would handle differently The jobs he could not do he recommended someone and he provided a realistic informative discussion of the materials needed which I purchased which saves the consumer a lot of money He clearly has an eye toward saving consumer money and works diligently while he was here The time he was running late he called promptly Very pleasant to work with Will definitely use for all handymen type jobs Highly recommend for all those jobs you have been putting off
5,They have excellent service and they did good work They are very good company to work with I have had no problems whatsoever
5,He was very professional showed up on time every morning and even came back out earlier the next day to make sure the job was completed before the painters got here Did a great job with out charging an arm and a leg and I will deffinatley be calling him again in the future I have saved his number in my phone Bypass all other handymen and go straight for him he is worth it and you wont regret it I just hope he is available when i need him next time
5,I hesitate to say how good he is for fear of him getting too busy But he deserves the highest praise He knows what he is doing and doesnt waste any time getting his jobs done Im making a list
5,Put together furniture fixed light switch put nails in brick they were quick and did exactly like i wanted
5,Contacted David by email using the link on Angies list He got back with me within a couple of days and was able to do the work according to our schedule
5,We Can Do was very easy to work with Very pleasant punctual and easy to get in touch with He quoted a very reasonable price for the work and actually charged less when it was done Cleaned up work space Finished work very quickly even though he had to come out 2 more times to finish sanding the drywall Excellent work You cant tell that there wherever 5 large holes in the wall Will definitely call him again and recommend him to my friends and family
5,Main handyman arrived on time with his fatherinlaw who originally started the business and provided assistance as necessary Both men were professional capable and very personable They stayed on task answered all questions and were able to troubleshoot problems as they arose I feel confident that they would let me know if a job required another person with different skills than they have
5,he does great work but best of all he explains every thing and the ways we might want something done and how much each way would cost so that we can choose We will certainly have him do work for us in the near future My husband would like a little lower cost
5,I had a great experience using WeCanDo handyman service and would highly recommend it to others
5,Great job
5,fine did a good job
5,Perfectly well
5,Guy was a perfectionist
4,They dont level mobile homes
5,Amazing people Amazing Work
5,He was very detailed and did a great job I have used before
4,gThey came out very promptly after I called and did a professional and thorough job They installed the closet rack mounting the hooks more securely so it wont rip out of the drywall again The same day they installed 2 bath lights and fixed the drywall around it A few days later they came back and cut beveled wood boards to replace my old ones on my front porch posts They primed and painted the boards also to match
5,Mr Hammond proved to be a skilled contentious and reliable worker He was pleasant to work with and maintained a tidy work site Iwould not hesitate to use his services again
1,I called them and they could not help me out until a week or so after
5,They came out and looked at the job The guy who came out said it will take 23 hours to complete the job He gave me an estimate of around 35 an hour which was less than what another guy charged me He was pleasant He talked about some other things He gave me some advice on future jobs I was thinking about When I called him he said he would here the next day and he was here the next day He was on time
5,He did it very quickly the day we requested the service A quality job was done swiftly and we will definitely use this companys services again
5,We couldnt be more pleased David was professional kept us informed on schedule and had wonderful ideas He completed everything on time and under budget and finished before Derby despite the April monsoons He also managed to complete extensive plaster repairs and painting and kitchen cabinet painting and hardware replacement at our daughters house during the same time period We will definitely be using him again
5,went great Wil be using him again in the very near furture painting this time
5,Outstanding work We had to cancel the first appointment due to weather but he promptly rescheduled and arrived on time for the second appointment My husband was home when the door was hung My husband was pleased and that says a lot We will use this company in the future
5,These guys did a great job They were very quick to arrive and quote the job and the total installation did not take more than a few days to give the mud appropriate drying time We noticed some small imperfections in a couple areas and they took care of it without issue they also insulated the outer wall at no extra charge
5,Ordinarily I am too busy to report on service providers But Mr Hammond is a gem Last job he did for me was to remove a lighting fixture and install two in its place at opposite ends of a room one of which was a fan He had to got out and get some extra parts and crawl into my attic to get the job done Great job Done in a day When Mr Hammond did his first job for me I offered to pay part of the job up front He refused to take my money and told me right away that he never accepted any payment until he was sure his customer was completely satisfied You cant go wrong hiring this man
5,Two other contractors were lined up to do the job but were repeat no call no shows I called We Can Do LLC and Mr Hammond showed up at my door a few hours later gave me a reasonable quote and started the job right there My ceiling did not require a huge drywall job like the other two led me to believe but merely a plaster repair He came everyday to apply coats of plaster and then sanded it down on the fourth day Its a perfect job Im so pleased Its rare to find a company that answers their own phone and keeps their promises these days thanks We Can Do LLC Ill be a lifelong customer
5,They did a very good job The job was done quickly by one worker and he completed the job within 2 hours He did show up on time and cleaned up after he was done with the job They came and started the project within two days of the time when I called them
5,I thought he was great He came when he said he would He did what he said he would do We were very pleased with him He called us back a lot of times people in that industry dont do that He showed up on time He cleaned up all the mess I was very happy with him
5,Excellent service and work
5,Great service
5,see review
5,Went great Very thorough
5,A very good experience
5,Joshua was incredible He did a perfect job and did it quickly With Covid being a worry I asked him to do the work in my garage which is not heated I felt terrible about that but he was very agreeable and polite I could not have asked for a better person to do the job I would definitely hire him again He gets a A from me
5,Wonderful I would hire them again
5,We are very pleased with this work Repair of walls looks great The pattern in the plaster was matched and painted Joshua was on time and got right to work He cleaned up after the job was complete
5,Joshua showed up on time and was ready to go with all the materials He estimated it would take 23 hours and it ended up taking about that time He is professional with a great attitude and I would hire him again This was a fairly small project which many wont do because its not worth it but Joshua understands one small project usually leads to more in the future He has good business sense and did a great job on this project
5,Had couple drywall repairs that he took care of for me Very punctual reasonable  did a Great Job
5,Josh and his nephew did a an outstanding job very professional in his work 5 stars
1,first time the call did not go through Next time I left a message no one ever called back
5,Joshua has been great He has proven to be a tremendous help in preparing our house in the Highlands for our move this spring So far he has installed a kitchen sink water filtration system garbage disposal new lighting inside and outside oak handrails and newel posts for the main stairs a new 15 countertop in the laundry area new front storm door replaced a dimmer switch while reanchoring a track lighting fixture and he has fortified the long closet rod in an upstairs closet Joshua is prompt efficient and extremely professional As a sole proprietor of his business his name goes on every project and he is very mindful of that fact I will absolutely continue using Joshuas services and highly recommend him to anyone who needs a wellrounded handyman Having gotten several quotes before beginning work I determined Joshuas pricing to be very reasonable
5,Very well I was very impressed with his attitude and professionalism
5,The first handyman I contacted through Angies list did NOT get the job done because he had bigger irons in the fire and I do not think he knew what he was doing He kept bumping me off of his agenda over a period of three days I would NEVER call him again The second one was considerate gave me a reasonable price fixed my two projects and was prompt Both jobs were done to my satisfaction as promised within an hour for a reasonable price He had an assistant This second handyman is one the husband of the childhood friend of my daughter This second workman who did a firstrate job is a very capable and polite man that I would be glad to ask to do jobs for me in the future His name is David Hammond
5,Ceiling looks great and he did a great job Will definitely hire again
4,The work was performed on schedule and correctly However the drywall finish wasnt great The mesh was still showing when complete Thankfully the drywall contractor I had come in afterwards fixed the work
5,Im providing an A grade rating to this company because of their honesty I loved that this company was transparent and did not commit just to get our business and then make us wait like so many others do I spoke to Josh and he was honest at providing his availability Even though we didnt to do business with him due to our immediate needs we will certainly keep him in mind if ever needed
5,It went well The work was done quickly and the craftsmanship is good
5,Handyman was timely professional and helpful
5,When we finally connected he came over and did an excellent job
5,It went well He was the lower of two bids for the above work
5,He as always did a great job for a fair price Highly recommended
5,The work turned out excellent and I would hire again andor recommend him to other people The workman ship was excellent and complete
5,Joshua is very good at what he does I LOVE my new bathroom I had intended to just get needed repairs done in my bathroom but Joshua suggested some tweaks that would update the entire room He was willing to do whatever I wanted but I went with his suggestions and could not be more thrilled And he stayed within my budget Excellent work professional kept work space clean responded quickly to any concerns and price was very reasonable
5,Very good extremely nice and did a great job of repairing walls and ceiling Even went to Home Depot to get caulk to complete time I had paid for
5,Joshua was great Arrived early did the job needed was very friendly and answered all my questions
2,After much back and forth as to time to do the work a schedule was finally agreed upon I took off work and waited and waited   finally I emailed him and his response was that he had not put my name in the time slot Not a word yet about rescheduling or refunding coupon cost
5,Very well so smooth on dry wall I only have to sand a little bit very professional
5,Joshua performed the work above and beyond my expectations He explained what he was going to do and gave me great information for what to look for to determine if we have a larger issue than just old grout
5,Great Prompt courteous excellent work
4,Punctual very nice I may have been expecting too much on the crack in my ceiling
5,Josh came on time and did an excellent job He explained everything he did and told me hints to try to prevent it from happening again I will definitely use Josh again on future projects
5,I am very pleased with the quality of work and would recommend this professional
5,I was very impressed We will be hiring him again
5,He began work as agreed and ontime Was careful in repairing what could be repaired and what had to be replaced Nice job distressing replacement wood to match original Came in at the lower end of the quoted range
5,Excellent He even bought the new hinges
5,Sun porch is approximately 10 x 12 We supplied paint and primer Joshua recommended a highquality primer since we were painting an interior vinyl surface He also supplied some extra primer Joshua took extra care with caulking brad holes taping baseboard and metal hardware and any other imperfections Nice job Repaired a 90year old Russwin door latch Removed a bathroom door to completely rehab which included removing and polishing all metal hardware Very well done Work done ontime and as always at a fair and reasonable price
5,He is excellent and very fast and neat He does excellent work as well In fact I damaged someone elses house and I had him go and fix that too at a reasonable rate I would highly recommend him
5,Josh did a great job He arrived on time worked fast and did a great job He is highly qualified and is a very nice guy too We have already asked him to do more work for us
5,While in the midst of a renovation we ran into a problem requiring installation of a new ceiling electrical box Joshua has done multiple jobs for us in the past so I called and asked if he could come the next day so we wouldnt have to delay our project Joshua was gracious to come even though he had a full days work scheduled Hes a gentleman and always does a good job
2,His caulking job was fine good work BUT IT took him 3 12 hours to caulk 4 tubs He double charged me because he said the Angies List deal was only for one residence and I had him do two apartments Whats the difference 75hr for two hrs of caulking in either kitchen or bathroom is what I bought So I paid him additional 75  culda got it done with Lowes or Home Depot guys for 50 But The guy knocked a tile off the wall left it barely hanging Going to have to have that fixed now thanks to him And then somehow he pulled the handle on the handheld shower head dropped it and broke it So now because of him I have to go out and buy another showerhead extension and pay another handyman to put it on for me Sono dont think it went very well for me at all Mr Roark however made out like a bandit
5,If you are a perfectionist or are married to a perfectionist like I am Josh is your guy He replaced four exterior doors and three screen doors in our circa 1964 house with new doors from Home Depot They look great and fit perfectly He is a great communicator and does an outstanding job for a very reasonable price
2,The drywall repair was okay but wasnt smooth and they suggested it was ready to be repainted which is just silly In the process of the ceiling drywall repairs the moulding at the top of one of my cabinets was broken off and repaired by haphazardly nailing it back in place crooked and bending the nails onto the wood  I would have preferred that they admit they did not have the proper tools and wait to do the repair We contacted them to come back and repair it which they did It was done but still not very well its obvious not flush with the rest of the cabinet but it seems to be permanently warped or something He showed up in a bad mood pretty much just coming in and leaving without saying anything obviously upset that he had to come back Even though the repair was mediocre we were ready to be done with them
4,It was alright We were not able to come a convenient appointment until the March or so He offered to come but we were unable to make our appointments work He showed up when we agreed to and kind of cleaned up after himself The price good I dont think that he did as good a job on finishing it up especially with the spackle I think that could have been done a little bit better
5,Josh did a terrific job He arrived in time was friendly and professional Kept the area clean Would definitely recommend Josh and would hire again
5,Joshua provided the estimate on a prior visit and showed up the day he scheduled the repair even though it was raining all day He completed the work in a day and agreed to add on some extra indoor repairs I requested He and his coworker were professional and thoughtful
5,It went fine It was just the cost of the Deal They were a little late but they called and let me know so it was fine I would recommend them They had a lot done in the 2 hours
5,At first we had some difficulty punctuality professionalism thoroughness of the job as we were working with a gentleman who was an employee for the owner Joshua For reasons unknown to me this employee no longer works for Joshua After I began working directly with Joshua things got immediately better He and his assistant were very professional polite and flexible They were eager to work with me to make things right and exceeded my expectations I have since scheduled more work to be performed
5,Joshua ran a little late the morning of the appointment but was good about informing me I was off all day so it wasnt any kind of problem Quality work and looks good The job was bigger than the 2hours purchased through Angies List but hes coming back late this week to finish the job
4,The worker arrived on time the first day and worked on caulking the showertub I also asked him to return to repair some drywall in various areas of the house at an additional price He was late the second time he came and did not call to let me know The caulking work was not acceptable and I asked him to redo it Even the redo was not acceptable to me The drywall repair was good The young man and his coworker were pleasant but I dont feel that the caulking work was professional quality I wanted it to look better than if my husband had done it and it didnt Very disappointed but at least it didnt cost very much
3,New grout did not match the remaining old grout  the new was much darker I declined the providers offer of a redo
5,Joshua Roark came write on time He promptly started working I had a leak over the granite tile above the kitchen counter The kitchen counter tile had lifted Joshua carefully removed the tile without a scratch and placed it back in place He also fixed the drywall above the kitchen counter My wife came home and was very pleased with the work performed I would highly recommend him
1,We received no reply form our inquiry to this provider
5,The handyman and his helper arrived on time worked quickly and finished the task in the twohour timeframe that I had already paid for I was very pleased with the finished product and with how knowledgeable this handyman was of historic properties He shared some very good ideas with me about how to proceed with the bathroom renovation
5,Came on time and completed job I less than 3 hours My wife had been wanting this done but I just couldnt get around to it Happy I called them Excellent job
5,Very professional friendly costefficient work Would use again
5,Josh and Jamal were on time extremely courteous and professional They completed the work requested in a timely manner and cleaned the area accordingly I would definitely recommend them and would hire them again
5,Old caulk was removed which was a challenge New caulking was completed It made a tremendous difference in the appearance in the areas that were done Everyone was professional I would definitely use them again
5,Professional Handyman arrived on time and went right to work I showed him some other projects I wanted done and he prepared an estimate His rates are reasonable and his work is professional
5,Josh was prompt and professional He called ahead to let me know when he was coming He was on time and completed the work exactly as promised and cleaned up the bathroom following the job Great service
5,It worked out really well They did a very professional job and it was exactly what we needed I rated it highly
5,It worked out really well There were no extra fees They did a very professional job It was exactly what we needed
5,Josh and his assistant were great I was very impressed with him as he gave me a time to meet him at my house and he was actually there a minute early He gave me a fair estimate and I accepted He showed up at my house again on time and completed the work when he said he would and it looks great My wife was hesitant about strangers being in our home when we werent there but Josh is very trustworthy and no need to worry if you cant be there while he is working He does general handyman jobs and I will use him again should the need arise
5,Excellent They arrived exactly on time completed the work efficiently and well I will definitely use them again
5,These guys were great I had really only planned to have the shower caulk removed and recaulked and that would have been worth the 75 to me but they told me that wouldnt take 2 hours so we added 2 tubs caulking to the original job Since they were here and I had another thing I needed fixed I asked if fixing a pocket door would be something they would be able to do Of course they could and they fixed it at a very reasonable cost They were very punctual polite professional and I asked for their card as I plan to hire them again whenever I need a handyman Highly recommend Thanks Josh and Jamal
5,Meticulous removal of old caulking with new razor blade for each room Perfect new caulking deep and neat A true craftsman and artist with a caulking gun A great value with so much accomplished for such a reasonable cost I will never try caulking myself again
5,Joshua arrived on time and went right to work My husband and I were amazed at how quickly and expertly he performed the job This is an older home and neither the floor or walls are level or square Joshua efficiently made adjustments to make the cabinets and countertops work without additional expense to us I had ideas that werent the easiest to execute but Joshua completed the task without complaint and even politely suggested ways to improve on my ideas He did a superb job installing a dishwasher where one didnt exist He is a quality craftsman as well as a very fine person He was extremely easy to work with and I will always use Joshua for repairs His pricing is very reasonable when you consider how quickly he performs the work We really appreciate his attention to detail and his commitment to pleasing his client Ive already scheduled Joshua for another job
5,Joshua is great He looked over the work I needed done and quietly made great suggestions that saved me money He was there working efficiently Yes there are times when he needs to pick up his sons because his wife is finishing school but I was flexible and trusted him to let himself in and out of the house as needed I was out of town and impressed that he had everything done so quickly and well When he saw an area outside that he missed mortaring he was back the next day and fixed it without me even knowing it Hes a hard worker and he came up with some creative solutions for an area that was really hard to work with Hire him Im going to write him write now and ask him to come do some other tasks So wait a day or two please before contacting him
4,They arrived on time but did not have all their tools on the truck Left to go back and get what was needed then realized that the snake had been broken on a previous job and not repaired I marked down a little on professionalism because they should have checked all their tools and supplies before heading out for the day The work they did was fine and I would use them again I think the experience was a learning one for them on checking their equipment
5,Joshua came with his partner John and completed the work they hung 22 pieces of art and 2 mirrors and moved three huge carpets and put three different carpets in their place They were great as long has hes willing to do handyman services well use him and or his team They completed the job taking care to hang art with wall mollies to ensure their safety all the while being very very professional I have just remodeled our home and have had electricians plumbers and painters who would be wise to take a page from Joshuas book in professionalism LOOK NO FURTHER youve found your next handymanjust call Joshua
5,also calked under my kitchen cabinets Like I said he has a good eye for detail I would use him again
5,Joshua and his helper quickly moved through my projects They were very professional Im having them back to install screen door when its delivered
5,They did a great job There were no additional fees associated with the Big Deal not even for materials The guy who comes out is easily available and does what we ask him to do He is professional at caulking bathrooms and his pricing is great on Angies List
5,He was efficient nice attentive He did what I asked and it was quality work
5,I was allowed to use the coupon that I had purchased from Angies list but due to the problem the cost was higher Both men were professional courteous and respectful The job was explained as what needed to be done and its cost Only wish that I had was that they had provided and installed a new tub drain mesh as well
5,Everything turned out well They showed on time and did the work as promised
4,It was good He was a pleasant guy did good work and did a good job He looked good and cleaned up He took him about six hours and probably paid him an extra thirty dollars
5,The drain cleaning ran into a hiccup with piping what was in poor condition The gentleman took extra time and repaired the piping
5,Joshua was very nice to work with He arrived promptly and went right to work on cleaning grout around our two tubs He applied caulking where needed He also applied a layer of silicon seal to finish the project We are very pleased with the finished project He also did a nice job cleaning up when he was finished
5,We just wanted to hire someone who is dependable and is good at what they do After looking at his reviews we decided to hire him When we contacted him he was able to come out on a Saturday to provide an estimate He ended up being able to complete the work on the same day It turned out really good and it looked much better after he completed the work We are going to be calling him to install the bathroom fan in the future
4,Josh arrived exactly as scheduled and went right to work He was a very pleasant young man and a pleasure to have in our home He regrouted the shower and caulked where needed He also caulked around the tub and vanities without being asked
4,he did a pretty good job looked clean and fresh after he was finished
4,Service came out and previewed work requested and approved list The work done was done well except for the ceiling fan Fan was out of balance and needed to be cleaned and balanced He worked on the fan for a long time 3 hours and no fan remote will not work Spent a lot to time trying to fix a problem that wasnt the issue He didnt carry a lot of tools and had to make trips to get them He even requested that we pay for renting a taller ladder to facilitate the work The eight hours work was scheduled over the course of a month because of the limited time he was available only week days from mid morning until 3 PM due to child care issues I will say again the work was good just long and drawn out
5,The service provided by Professional Handyman worked out fine I got the job done He was quick and communication was fine
5,He was on time He did his work He was clean He gave us a good estimate There were no complaints about it Everything was fine
3,Our kitchen sink is badly clogged and they tried to unclog it but broke a pipe The sink is still clogged but I think thats mostly because our plumbing system is badly designed so theres more work to do no matter what My landlord was not happy with the results but I thought the father and son who came and fixed it were very nice people If anything I think their customer service was great
5,Joshua did an excellent job In fact Joshua also put in a back yard fence re routed gutters and cleaned brick mortar for me Also when there were problems with the air conditioning Joshua went right over checked out and repaired the problems I have been so pleased with Joshuas vast knowledge in diagnosing and repairing the home maintenance problems Ive had this year I would use Joshua in the future and both recommend and endorse his work quality Mary P
5,He was very fast friendly and efficient He also seemed quite knowledgeable about all types of projects
4,I have used this provider three times The first time Josh did the work himself and he did a beautiful job The bathroom looked great and the cleanup was immaculate The next two times he had a new worker in training The quality of the work was not the same and I had to cleanup the excess grout myself I would use this company again if Josh was doing the work himsef
3,Part of the work was of pretty good quality and part not very satisfactory Not very good on cleanup or do over where needed If I needed tile work done again other than the very simplest thing I would hire a tile specialist This contractor in my opinion is not in that category A Very nice person but the work as a whole was somewhat disappointing
3,It was okay It was supposed to be 8 hours worth of work It was not a direct 8 hours of service they are allowed to bring somebody and split the time up I didnt see that part He came and said someone else was coming I just thought it was a friend and didnt know that it was on my dollar which it was He did 4 hours and the other guy did 4 hours I probably wouldnt use them again
5,He responded quickly to my emails and showed up on time He came out to take a look at the job and then came back on 2 different dates to finish the work This was great because the coupon we bought just covered 4 hours of grouting and caulking and he actually needed some thin set for the tiles in addition to grout and caulk We are very pleased with the work Turns out hes a widely talented handyman so well be able to work with him again in the future on other odd jobs He cleaned up after himself and only charged us extra for the special caulk he had to purchase to match our tile grout which was a great attention to detail
5,The person who came out was very prompt and very efficient The price was appropriate Id absolutely hire him again
4,I was looking to replace the missing and damage wood siding on my chimney They seemed knowledgeable and they were professional But I decided to use a local company instead I will not use them in the future
5,The repairman fixed all broken grout and cleaned shower He did not however have the sealant and asked me if I had already purchased it I was not aware that I had to Other than that he did a great job Will probably use him again
2,The handyman from Professional Handyman was on crutches when he got here and he brought somebody with him to take up the slack and I had purchased 2 hours of professional handyman service and I wanted a ceiling fan to be hung and it required me making a scaffold in the room so that they could work He told me that it would take longer than 2 hours to hang the fan and he said he would charge an extra USD 200 to get the fan up and that was estimating an extra couple hours The fan got put up and the handyman wasnt here very much and he was gone to different places but the guy who was helping him did most of the work I really had questions as to whether it took as long as they did to hang the fan and I went ahead and paid the extra USD 200 and he said that he thought that it was more than that because he had 2 guys on the job and I told him that he was himself on crutches but he paid me by the man hour so I ended up paying much more to get the job finished I just wasnt happy I dont think I good dealHe made the comment that he had 2 men on the job but one man was not capable of doing anything I told the guy to use his best conscience and let that be his guide He offered to give me a USD 20 refund and I thought that was a slap in the face They took so long to do it and I have hung fans in the ceilings and it doesnt take 45 hours to do it It was a vaulted ceiling and he knew that before he got it he should have passed the job over instead of doing that
5,Joshua meant with me to get the floor loaded And bought back to the house and unloaded It as well Great guy
1,I contacted the company via email with information about what work I needed done I did not receive a all for two weeks Once contacted I was informed the owner was in the hospital and that the caller worked with him and could assist in providing an estimate for the work I needed The caller informed me they were busy since the owner was in the hospital but could come out the following week I requested him to call me the next week to confirm his Saturday appt he called Friday to let me know he could come that day but would be able to come Saturday He never showed up never called to cancel or reschedule
3,I called provider before scheduling the work to describe the job and make sure he was equipped and able to do what we needed The job was described to the provider as cutting and installing tiles around the base of bathroom vanities It would require cutting so the tile would fit around the corner base of each vanity He said he would be able to do what was required and had experience so I scheduled the job After arriving I showed him the three vanities the four corners of the vanities two tiles on one vanity and one tile on each of the other two vanities for which tile was to be cut and placed He suggested just putting grout under the cabinet instead of tile because he thought no one would be able to see it I repeated that we wanted the tile to be cut to fit around the cabinet base and that you could see underneath when sitting in the bathroom When he finished three of the four tiles he said he thought he was done I checked and saw that he had left one area undone so I gave him the tile and he started again When he cut the tile he said it didnt break where he wanted it to because it was brittle He asked again if he could just grout under the cabinet I called the owner and he affirmed that the tile was to be cut around the cabinet rather than just a straight cut and grout The tile was the only one we had so it was too late to do an L cut that would fit around the cabinet so he just cut another small piece from the scrap tile and installed it under the cabinet instead of just grout I said though not the best it was better than just grout I discovered then that the other 3 had been just grouted under the cabinets instead of cutting the tile as he had been told But then his 4 hours were up and he had another job so it was too late to do it right He mentioned as he was leaving that he usually only did repair work which didnt justify him having the saw for detail work I wish hed told me that and been honest with me before we scheduled the job and told me he couldnt do the required work I feel the provider was not honest in representing what he could do both before we scheduled and during the install We are now stuck with the only tile we had being destroyed for any repair work wed like to have done to remove repair wall cut and install tile like we requested We were very unhappy and will not use again or give a good reference
5,Project completed in a short time No problems
5,Great They completed the work in a timely manner Grouting  caulking the entire tub area They also recaulked around my sink I would recommend this Co to anyone who needs grouting caulking etc They did an excellent job for a fair price
5,Great Im very happy with the finished product
5,Worked very carefully  it took him a few days to complete the work but it was beautiful when finished
5,Everything he does is good and he is a good finish carpenter
5,He did a fantastic job
5,JOB WENT WELL
5,Fantastic
1,Handyman never returned my call 
1,No one ever even responded
5,Went great
3,Too expensive 15000 per sill
5,Extremely well
1,They never called me back
5,Josh arrived on time Performed his duties in a very timely manner cleaned up and was gone
1,I called on 10412 to arrange for roof repair The guy stated he would be here at 730 am on 10512 NEVER SHOWED  He called approximately 1 hour after his stated arrival time wanting to come in the sfternoon I had already called someone else to do the repair due to rain forcast for afternoon
1,I dont think they were professional at all because they didnt write me anything out that is what bothered me and when I questioned his prices and I ask him if he could please write me something out he went to the store and sent me pictures of the parts and prices I thought that was ridicules and they he changed his prices He said he way under quoted me but he still was pretty low so I was going to have him do the work and then he emailed me back and said he would not be able to do the work He said he had way underbid me and he wouldnt be able to come to my house and give me a quote I thought all of that was unprofessional To me somebody should write you out an estimate that says this is what I am going to do and these are the prices To tell somebody you are going to do the work and then the day before back out I just would never recommend them They were punctual but they were not professional I was very shocked because I thought they were on Angies List because they were very good and professional
5,He was meticulous in his work and clean up He will be back to perform other services for us
5,He arrived around 800 AM armed with all his tools and even a tarp to throw on the floor to contain the mess from the removal of old grout soap scum and mildew from our shower He worked steadily until the job was done about 300 PM When he left the shower shined like a jewel so I was very pleased with trying my first service through Angies List He was extremely professional and caring about his work I am going to keep his name and contact information in my iPhone so I can give his contact information to my friends and family
5,He did great He always tries to save me money without cutting corners
5,Fantastic value Went above and beyond for our bathroom  including removing our shower doors for extra thorough cleaning and remounting them after the job was done Clean polite diligent and considerate Well done
5,Overall this job went off without a hitch No major snags and he took care of the minor ones

5,Arrived on time friendly and efficient
5,Did a great job Came out as promised Dug deep to remove all signs of mold Replaced grout and came back a few days later to caulk because grout hadnt dried yet I appreciated that he didnt just caulk and Id never have known I had paid him for 3 hours and he had some time left and offer to replace caulk and grout around my tube Again I that wasnt part of our deal but I sure appreciated it
5,We originally bought 4 hrs of tile grout and caulk work from one of Angies list specials However when Joshua came to do the work it was discovered that we had extensive water damage behind one wall in the tub area Found out there was water condensation doing the damage from improper installation of drywall from a previous job He replaced the drywall with durock a sheet of concrete replaced tile grout and caulk He spent 4 days here making sure the job was done properly There was a day he was unable to arrive as scheduled but called us to let us know of his delay and the delay wasnt that bad We are very pleased with Joshuas work and are planning on using him in the future
5,Joshua was here when he said he would be did the work in a professional manner and when he finished prior to the four hour time frame to which we had committed he offered to hang a towel rack which had fallen down in the area in which he was working It fell through no fault of his He did the job cleaning up any mess that was created as the result of doing so I will definately have him back to provide some of the other services he list on his profile

5,Nate was early which is awesome and something that rarely happens He was professional and cleaned up after he was finished also something we havent seen very often when weve had people do work in our home There was an issue with the first electrical box being very difficult to remove so it took more time than he planned so he worked on the first light left to take care of another customer then came back to finish the second He had to replace the existing electrical boxes with the reinforced boxes which we anticipated so we purchased them along with the fans ahead of time There was an additional fee of 50 per each fan for Nate to replace the electrical box with the reinforced ones which he let me know ahead of time If it was a 11 swap there wouldve been no additional charge

5,Nate was a little backed up schedulewise when I purchased the deal which was fine because I had a lot going on for a couple of weeks myself He did reach out to me once when he had an unexpected opening the next morning but I couldnt make the appointment work with my schedule When my schedule started to open up I gave him a call We arranged a date and time roughly a week out He texted me the night before he was scheduled to arrive to confirm the time would still work He showed up promptly and in under 30 minutes had the outdoor light installed Then he went to work on the fan which he wrapped up in about 45 more minutes Nate is a friendly efficient handyman and after wrapping up the fan he spent a few minutes with me talking through options for a door issue I have in one room I asked him his thoughts on it and if he could replace the fullsized door with another option and he was frank with me about the cost and complications around that and recommended I speak to some folks at Lowes who specialize in door installations for a less expensive option I appreciated his honesty We always need a good handyman for general things around the house and I asked for Nates card so I could call him again the next time something comes up that we need help with I highly recommend him and his work
5,On time and quick I left the house and when I got back they were both up and working Would use again
5,Nate was very quick to respond when I purchased the deal on Angies list A few days later I had to reschedule and he was actually able to work us in even earlier than was originally scheduled He replied to all my emails very promptly He called about 30 minutes prior to arrival which is helpful to a busy mom who spends more time in her minivan than at home After he installed one of the fans I realized that I purchased the wrong size extension rod Nate had to take down the fan and reinstall it with the correct length rod Because of this it took a lot longer than expected but there were no additional charges for having to take down the fan and reinstall even though it was my mistake that I purchased the wrong length rod We will definitely use Nate again in the future for various handyman jobs and are thankful that we found him through Angies List
5,We have tall ceilings which was not a problem for Nate Some places we called charged more for high ceilings He had to make some adjustments to the brackets which he did with no problem One of the fans was a little wobbly so he even came back out to fix it when he was in the area I would not hesitate to recommend Nate
5,Nate was so nice He fit us in at the earliest slot in his schedule which was very much appreciated Very professional prompt and did very nice work Will call Nate again for other work
5,He did a great job ALL of our fixtures turned out to be challenging installs but he was able to get them all up The chandelier is about 10 feet up in the air over the stairs landing and so he had to hang over the railing at the top of the stairs and balance himself on a ladder over the 10 foot drop to install it If we need anymore lights installed I would definitely use him again
5,We initially bought the 2 fan installation but then decided to add additional work such as the dimmer and moving one fan to another room He was very professional while assembling the units by cleaning up after each install and was very respectful of our home and then he did the additional unexpected work without a fuss He was promptly on time very reasonable and competitive in his pricing pleasant demeanor and great workmanship We would highly recommend him and his company

5,We scheduled a time and he came over Unfortunately he was not able to install the lights due to the odd wiring behind the existing light He said that since he was not a licensed electrician he was not able to mount the lights with complete certainty because the wiring was so old He was very polite and nice about the situation and told me to send you guys an email for a refund on the money Thank you

5,Very good and very efficient
5,Great and professional
5,GREAT AS ALWAYS WHEN I CALE NATE
5,Nate showed up on time and completed the installations in a timely manner and disposed of the old fans as well
5,Called Nate to see about getting a few things done around the house He was able to stop by within a day to see exactly what I wanted done texted me with a quote that same evening Although he was booked for that week and I expected wed have to push to the next week or the week after that which would have been fine with me  none of the jobs were critical he was able to make it out late the week to perform the work He arrived a little early and set to work He patched two holes in the powder room I had previously had a tolilet paper holder in the wall but when I had someone install crown molding in that room the installer stepped on the tp holder and broke it off from the wall It was easier to remove the whole thing and patch the holes than to try to reinstall the tp holder arms While the patch work was drying he began working on installing the cat door This gave him a little bit of a fit and took more time than I think he anticipated But I do think that was because of the qualitydesign of the cat door itself and had nothing to do with Nates ability I do think the job might have been a little easier if he had had clamps to hold both pieces to each side of the door but apparently he didnt have any and neither did I In the end he ended up adding an additional screw to the top of the cat door to make it a little more flush to the door again a qualitydesign issue with the cat door It works perfectly fine although after installation I did end up removing the flap as my cat didnt want anything to do with going in and out of the door with the flap on it Without the flap he uses it just fine And last but not least Nate removed an existing light fixture and replaced it with a new one I had purchased We had initally agreed on another job of removing an existing and installing a new over the range microwave but after Nate had removed the old nonworking one and taken the new one out of the box we discovered the new one required venting to the outside of the house for the range hood part which is something I dont currently have Nate was honest in that he didnt feel comfortable doing that type of work So he repacked the new microwave and we called it a day I am pleased with Nates work I wouldnt hesitate to recommend him and to use his services again for any basic household repair Additionally I think is pricing is very very fair
5,Would highly recommend Nate High quality work and a pleasure to deal with Will use his services again
5,I loved the service that Nate provided he came on the first day to install 2 light fixtures he arrived right on time and installed one light fixture but the other I ended up picking the incorrect style for my ceiling so he had to return a second occasion to put up the correct style he arrived again right on time and his work was great not only does he do fabulous work  but he cleaned up all the boxes that was great I will use Nate again and I have already told my neighbors about the good work he does Thanks so much
5,Nate showed up early  He was very conscientious and personable Before the appoinment we spoke on the phone He asked me about the height of my ceilings in reference to whether he would need his ladder or not He was sure to ask me if I was content with the work that he completed before he left I am pleased with the work that he did I actually decided at that point that I would like to use Nate for other work So once he was finished we walked through my home and went over my punchlist in which I have several things about the house that need attention Nate let me know what if any materials it would take and also let me know an approximate time frame in which the work could be completed I am happy that I chose Nates Big Deal because now I have a Goto Guy Thanks Nate
5,Nate always returned my calls quickly He was ontime for both the estimate and the work He completed all the work in about 3 12 hrs Nate went over all the jobs showing his completed work and even fixed a problem with the kitchen faucet that I didnt know I hadHe vacuumed the rooms up after his work I think that the price was reasonable for the work done I cant speak highly enough of Nate He is a hardworkingconscientiousyounger guy who is looking to grow his small business through quality work at a reasonable price KudosNate
5,Nate did a great job on the original work we hired him to do  he was courteous punctual hardworking and offered ideas that were helpful We recently hired Nate again to handling our house closing punch list Nate came out on very short notice due to our time constraints and worked extremely hard all day long and into the evening to get the list completed Im not sure we would have been able to meet our requirements without Nates dedicated effort Hes a bright hardworking guy that I would recommend to anyone
5,Nate was timely and professional He went above and beyond the job to help us remove a few large items from the house as well I would definitely hire Updates by Nate again
5,Nate was punctual and did a fantastic job I needed two lights to be hung Unfortunately one of the lights was missing some of the pieces so he could only hang one of them on the first visit Nate was very accommodating and actually came back for a second visit to install the second one Overall a great experience and I would use Nate again for services
5,Nate did a fantastic job on this project The back patio area was a mess  dirty concrete moldy fence overgrown trees and dead bushes When I got home I hardly recognized it after the work he had done Working with Nate was a great experience from start to finish  he responded to my first call quickly scheduled a time to meet with me soon after provided a very reasonable fee quote on the same day planned the time to do the project within the next week and then arrived and completed everything as planned Would definitely hire him again and recommend him to friends
4,It went fine There was an upgrade fee for the ceiling fan remote I thought that it was a great deal I would use them again
5,I purchased an Angies List Big Deal for this service and it went well He was very professional did a great job and he is going to come back to install one more ceiling fan that I did not have parts for during the initial installation I was very impressed He was very kind and cleaned up after himself He left no mess which I appreciated
5,It was a good experience I had several things for him to do and he accomplished everything in the allotted time frame in a professional courteous matter I have used Nates services before and plan to continue as my needs arise
5,He went above and beyond what I expected He figured out how to install the fixtures not meant for the fans and fixed an existing problem caused by the original builder Nate stayed longer than he expected did more than he expected and added no more charge for the unexpected
5,We have done so much updating on our house for some reason we never followed through with some of the major lighting fixtures That is until we saw a special on Angies List for two installations for 99 Always a bit nervous about hiring a handyman because theyre as hard to find as a goodhonest mechanic So we checked out Nate on Angies list and decided to take a chance and take advantage of the special In the end it turned out to be one of the best decisions weve made Given the horrendous weather of late Nate was running behind schedule on his other jobs so he asked if he could work on a Sunday at no additional cost Well that certainly worked for us He arrived exactly on time actually 10 minutes early  and went right to work Very professional knowledgeablecleancut and friendly What also put our mind at ease was his pride in his workmanship You pay per job only after it is completed and only after you are totally satisfied Kind of funny but on one of the fixtures which was a challenge we knew it would be we were happy but he wasnt and kept working until he was satisfied In fact so impressed were we by the finished product in addition to the two fixtures on the special we had him install four more and do some repairs on our kitchen cabinet shelf Again we couldnt be happier with the outcome So happy were having Nate return in a couple of weeks to do some major repairs on our backyard fence
5,He arrived right on time Installation was flawless He made sure they were in the right spot and that the chandelier was hanging at the right height He was very thorough in cleaning up He even patched the holes from the previous fixtures I will definitely call him for handyman services in the future
5,It went great He was very professional and paid a lot of attention to the detail of the work and the stability of the fans
5,Nate installed two ceiling fans in my house today He arrived on time was very polite and did an excellent job at installing the two fans One fan was installed on an angled ceiling using a down rod at about 14 feet high I asked him several times if there was any additional charge for the angled ceiling and he said no each time explaining that this was the quoted price High integrity He even came back after leaving when we called to say we could not figure out how to work the fan Will definitely call him again for my ongoing house update projects
5,Nate responded extremely quick after I purchased the deal and scheduled the install for the following Monday today The original ceiling fan was installed in a nonstandard manner but Nate used his extensive homeimprovement experience to persevere The results are impressive I plan on hiring Nate for other projects around the house and highly recommend his work
5,From start to finish my experience with Nate was great You can tell he takes pride in what he does and his finished outcome proves it He was on time and worked efficiently He was very courteous and made sure I was happy with his work His prices were also very reasonable I would recommend Nate to my friends and family and will use Updates By Nate in the future

5,I was very much more than satisfied with all the work They Obtained all necessary supplies did an excellent job matching the stain on the doors to the surrounding trim showed up on time were professional and polite and checked with me numerous times to see if I liked what they had done The best thing I can say is that I WILL call them again for some additional projects I have in mind
1,The owner never called to schedule an appointment or called to inform me that he had chosen not to do the work
1,Overall I would say that the project started well and much of the work is good quality Mike started working for us back in late November and its now April He has basically quit the job with a lot of touchups still outstanding Mikes Crew Daryl Mark and Matt were constantly late and rarely worked a full day Their inability to show up at a reasonable time and stay more than 4 or 5 hours put the project multiple months behind We also had to have them correct many things that they didnt do well Mike further has nickel and dimed us thousands of dollars for his own crews delays and mistakes We have tons of texts receipts and more verifying this We have security cameras all over the home that also document their hours Were trying to sell the home but its not ready due to his inability to finish the job We have to find another contractor to fix the poor drywall repairs to the ceiling in the family room and touch up the kitchen cabinets they refinished We will have to pursue legal action against Mike for incomplete work to recoup some of the costs Its absolutely absurd that we have had to deal with so many project delays and that theyve been unable to finish the drywall repairs to the ceiling Im completely shocked by such poor project management and the end result We were trying to list the house for sale this month but now have to endure further project delays to deal with the mess that Mike has left us Theres literally so few things to finish Besides actually fixing the drywall we spent thousands on he still has to fix the cabinets his crew messed up and complete a few small work items and touch ups The cabinets do not shut properly and some are crooked They also had to resurface them after spending weeks and leaving tons of flaws in the paint A lot of the baseboards look bad because they didnt caulk them Theres countless paint touch ups Etc I really only think theres a couple days worth of work for him to just send a competent crew out to fix Weve paid 25000 to Mike Its just sad how poorly this project has panned out I have been helping my father update his home so itll sell quickly and for a profit If Mike were just to actually finish the project we would be elated so we can just put this behind us
1,I had rotted wood replaced on my garage and a shingle replaced on the house After 5 months of replacement the shingle came off I called the company 3 times and left messages to contact me I received no response even though their tape message states they will contact you in 24hrs I tried to email to get a response and received none Very unprofessional to not give any response to people they did work for Beware they will respond to do work however if the work is not correct they will ignore you I noticed on the 1 star reviews that are similar to mine the response is the same That response is usually I have no records of the calls I do have records of my calls and my email so come up with another response because that one is getting old
5,Mike Vecchio from The House Doctors is an absolute pleasure to work with One of the few companies who actually came through with an estimate for a major rehab of my screenedin porch and other items Mikes team Mark and others arrived when promised and worked on this job for several weeks until it was completed to my satisfaction There were many facets to the job and the team was communicative throughout ensuring I was in agreement with everything they did They even constructed a custom doggie door as part of the project Reliable and trustworthy I recommend The House Doctors
5,I originally started with looking at concrete platform steps which needed footers that proved too expensive The House Doctors provided me with alternate options using treated lumber and backfilling with gravel I am very grateful to Seth and Mike for working with me to understand the challenges come up with alternate solutions and work within my budget An excellent solution that ended up saving me 500000
4,The foreman of our project did a good job and was responsive to our requests to get things done in a professional manner The owner of House Doctors set appointments to finish up the project after we had paid and then his men didnt show This happened more than once After a final walk through we paid as indicated but over the next several days we determined the additonal cost for repairs did not justify the quality we received I requested a 2nd walk through with the owner to make adjustments but he did not get back with me We finally worked things out with the company and overall are satisfied with the quality of the finished project
1,I reached out via Angies List for a quote included detailed description and picturesno response Called two separate numbers and left voicemailsno response Believe it or not I then sent a detailed email with picturesa woman called an apologized for previous lack of response and an appointment was setno show After I had cleared furniture draperies etc I called the same day left message A woman called me back a day later and left a voicemail apologized and said contractor had Covid and they had to reschedule his appointmentsFOUR strikes they were definitely out I did not return the call I hired PatchMasters also on Angies list They do not have any reviews but they are a national company and after speaking with Joseph Gilliam who sounded very sincere I hired them and they did a great Job
3,Repair to drywall was excellent but window is still leaking
5,The project went very smoothly Chris and Joe from the House Doctors were very prompt courteous and competent The remodel was completed ahead of schedule and looks beautiful Im looking forward to working on the next project with them
5,fine He also found damage to the bricks in the chimney and repaired those
1,Horrendous from the get go Initial appointment they came without any of the tools to do the range hood install After waiting weeks for appointment they had to reschedule Told me theyd come the next day only to call me after id taken off work to say no they need to reschedule Wait several weeks again Called me day before the next appointment to say they have to reschedule again Everytime they ask me about deck painting I remind them its for a range hood install and fence staining They are impossible to get a hold of and offer no help With covid I realize delays happen but how can I trust they would do a good job when they dont even know what project theyre supposed to be doing and cant even make a single appointment happen over a 2 month period Would never use again
5,It was wonderful The whole experience was very pleasant The technician was polite and professional He worked steadily the whole time he was here He cleaned up after himself He went out of his way for me because at the time I wasnt well When we went to Home Depot to buy the supplies he went and brought me the handicapped shopping cart and taught me how to use it At the end of the shopping he picked me up at the door No swearing occurred He also asked if there was anything else he could do for me so he did a few other small tasks that I couldnt do for myself at the time So he did those for me as well When I need work done for the house The House Doctors are the people I call
5,Very quick and did a really good job
5,House Doctors did a really great job Very happy
5,Seth was a delight to work with personable yet professional He explained the work and was very meticulous Others were brought in to help with the list of tasks
5,Mike was a pleasure to talk to His crew showed up on time and took seriously our pandemicrelated concerns The quality of the work met our needs I liked that the crew leader suggested that they take care of a smaller issue in the basement while waiting for some of their work to dry which would otherwise be down time for them When the pandemic clears we have a list of small projects that need to be done and we will give The House Doctors another call at that time
5,Great Mike and Matt showed up on time They were friendly and knew just what they were doing They built a solid wood foundation and leveled it nicely They told me when they arrived that some of these sheds are more time consuming to assemble than people might expect and got permission to stay longer if necessary Turned out they got it all done very quickly and efficiently It looks great Ive used House Doctors before for work inside my home and it went well so I was glad to call them back Another very good job I recommend them
1,I suspect that the House doctor will show up at my house expecting his 16500 service fee Do I need to purchase the caulking prior I just dont want any caulking I need something that will last He never called me to discuss expectations or what has to be done I am so frustrated I do not know what to do This is the worst experience I have ever had hiring a contractor
5,AMAZING Great results better than I hoped for Seth is meticulous professional and friendly I couldnt be happier
5,Excellent  great communication Did a great job
1,Contractor did not return my phone callvoicemail Can not recommend when even a courtesy return call was not received This was the first such repair I have had to make and had no direction Was looking for guidance on repair or at least materials cost etc
5,Mark and Mike did an amazing job installing some bird guards on the outside of my bathroom vents They were super nice and professional Great sense of humor as well I will be calling them for my future needs around the house
5,It was great from start to finish They worked in a professional and courteous manner The quality of the work was excellent I couldnt have asked for a better experience
5,Excellent Great communication friendly Did everything I asked Hard workers Perfect one stop shop for everything I needed to get done Also they have deep cleaning service that is excellent If you need help getting your house ready for sale andor cleaning I highly recommend House Doctors
5,I am so pleased with The House Doctors They were super responsive via email text and phone during the entire process They came out right away to give me a quote and outlined everything via email They came out a few weeks later to complete the work and had two guys complete the project The men estimated that the work would take 3 days and it only ended up taking two I had a relatively complicated project and had asked The House Doctors to move my laundry room from the basement up to my second floor My house is over 100 years old so I wasnt sure what to expect This project required them to move electric and water lines through two floors of my house I had 5 companies actually come out and give me a quote each had a very different idea on how to complete the project The House Doctors had the easiest answer on how to get the work done with the least amount of work and their pricing was very reasonable The two workers were so friendly knowledgeable patient they answered all of my questions and took time to explain things to me and prompt I am amazed that they also left all of the spaces where they worked cleaner than when they arrived they swept and vacuumed after each day I will absolutely work with The House Doctors again for projects around my house
1,Terrible they gave me a time frame never showed never called
5,Fantastic My Mother was prepared with sheets to drape over the furniture and was planning on having a cleaning done afterwards None of that was necessary because the crew covered every inch of the room with plastic sheeting We were forewarned that it might be difficult to blend the patch with the rest of the ceiling but ultimately it looks fantastic We also had the crew examine the attic space above to see if there was a possibility of another future leak and they were kind enough to do so My hope now is that the crew from the condo association did an equally good job repairing the roof on the outside as the House Doctors did repairing the ceiling on the inside
5,Very well Brian was punctual Clean Professional and I sat with him while he worked and I was asking him questions and he was very polite and answered all my questions I felt we knew each other for awhile Definitely would hire him again and a matter of fact I already called him again
5,Our experience has been fantastic Our elderly mother needed help with housekeeping and Lori has been amazing She and Mom have developed a great relationship and Lori has been more than flexible with the schedule We are very pleased with our experience
5,Lori and Dawn arrived exactly on time They quickly got to work and the house sparkled when they were done Both Ladies were extremely professional and friendly I am thrilled that I decided to hire the House Doctors for my house cleaning Best decision that I have made in a while I highly recommend the House Doctors
5,Besides 375 for a one man job that took an hour Im relieved because two separate 2man crews from Home Depot could not and would not try to complete it It sounds ridiculous after watching and seeing a working micro wave that it was such a process but the House Doctors saved the day I will definitely call them again for our next handyman project Super nice guy  I was super comfortable to have him in my home with a newborn He called the day before to confirm and when he arrived in my driveway
1,DID NOT EVEN SHOW UP FOR THE QUOTE OR CONTACT US TO LET US KNOW THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO MAKE IT IF SHOWING UP FOR A QUOTE IS A TOUGH JOB I CANT IMAGINE THEIR WORKMANSHIP
5,Mike and his crew did a really good job with the work that was done in my home When Mike came to my house to give me an estimate for the work to be done as I was talking to him about the things that I wanted repaired and the work to be done I was very impressed with his wealth of knowledge and as the homeowner I really appreciated the fact that Mike explained to me in detail what they would need to do for the repairs for the things that needed to be fixed After his crew completed the work the work they did looked really good and you could tell that the work was professionally done They also completed the work in a timely manner There were just a few minor things that I wanted to be touched up afterwards and Mike was great with following up on those When I brought them to Mikes attention he followed up with me on the same day and he took care of them in a timely manner he scheduled a datetime to do the touch ups Mike and his crew were also very nice and pleasant to work with I will use The House Doctors for future work to be done in my home because they do work thats quality and looks good as well as looks professionally done
1,I received an initial call in response to my request for a quote through Angies List No one showed up to the scheduled appointment I have since left two voicemails over the past week to follow up and reschedule but have not received a return phone call
5,I will hire them again They were professional and they did a thorough job They brought their own cleaning supplies and they did what I asked them to do
5,Lori and Dawn have now cleaned twice for me and do a fantastic job The house just sparkles and smells so nice and clean when I get home They let me know when they arrive when they leave and are very pet friendly I love that they will wash windows and pay attention to small details like my makeup mirror even wiping down the refrigerator or sweeping off the deck if I ask Great decision to make a move to House Doctors
4,They were very responsive to me for my having contacting
5,Mark did a great job replacing the waterdamaged floor of our sink cabinet ETA was 9301130 am He came at 1000 and was done in 3 hours including a trip to Home Depot for supplies Great work We are going to have The House Doctors do our whole list of repairs weve been putting off for years
5,In preparation for listing my home I had a laundry list of small things to complete At this point I was already out of town at my new job and wasnt able to work on these things myself Mike and his wife Lori did a great job dealing with things like ceiling and trim painting carpentry and an entire deep cleaning including windows They responded quickly dealt with my hectic schedule and got the work done in time to list Thanks to the great final touches they put on the house I received two offers during the first open house
5,They are doing an excellent job including working around my very difficult schedule
5,Lori and Dawn have AMAZED me once again with professionalism These girls come prepared for work Always so polite and ready to get the job done My house looks and smells amazing Thank you So excited recommend them to my friends and family
5,The girls Lori and Dawn were AWESOME They were very professional and thorough They were extremely polite I will definitely be using their services again and again And will be recommending them to my family and friends
2,Called to schedule estimate Lauri was nice and responsive The day of the estimate Mike was running late He was very nice when he showed up I showed him different things like carpentry the kitchen ceiling and some plumbing We discussed what he would do He said hed give me my estimate to me via email I didnt receive my quote I called the office and Lauri said she will have him call me Weeks later he called me but he told me he was very busy and he was primary care giver for his sick father He said he would send it the following weekend Weeks went by I never heard anything so I called back saying that I didnt get the estimate and that Im anxious to get this work done UPDATE 6419 I received a message from the service provider last night about the estimate but was unable to answer Of course I didnt hear back from him until I posted this review He said on the message that he sent the estimate the following day after I spoke with Lauri and that he was waiting to hear from me Yet I got a phone call from him weeks later about his father and he apologized saying his father is ill and hes backed up but that he would send the estimate the following weekend Why would he say to me that he sent it right after I contacted his wife about it when I didnt hear from him weeks after that The story about the estimate doesnt add up I even called him after saying that I didnt get the estimate the second time he would send it to me Due to this I left him a message this morning advising that I have moved on and have found other contractors Its unfortunate that we couldnt get and work together but Ive moved on now
2,Once I was contacted  an appointment was set  They were a no call no show  and didnt return my calls after the fact
5,House Doctors have been cleaning my house for a little over a year and they are wonderful Lori and her crew are always on time bring their own supplies and equipment and make my home sparkle They are pleasant efficient and will do whatever needs to be done Id had doubts about hiring a cleaning service and now wonder how I managed without House Doctors If it was possible to give an A I would do it in a heartbeat
5,Until recently I have always cleaned my own house but Ive just become too busy to keep up with baseboards windows and deep cleaning Thank goodness for Lori and Dawn They are professional conscientious and genuinely nice to be around They really seem to enjoy cleaning and our house sparkles when they leave Theyre always on time and work very efficiently They bring their own cleaning products and equipment but they will use your vacuum and products if you prefer Lori always seems to fit me into their schedule when I need them and Im really grateful for their help Prices are very reasonable too I have always had very good experiences with the House Doctors
5,I love them They are thorough and professional and made me feel as if I was their most important client Their work is superb I highly recommend them
5,Fine Very satisfied They are hard workers
5,Everything was left clean and in order The people are very friendly I was very pleased and would hire this company again
5,Jim did an excellent job successfully completing a long list of home repairs in a professional and timely manner He gave accurate time expectations and suggested better options for solving lighting issues We would defiantly hire House Doctors again
5,I have been extremely pleased with this company I had initially hired the company for a deep clean The work was done so well that I went back to them for a regular biweekly service approx 2800 sq ft with a pet The ladies are very pleasant reliable and thorough On the occasions that Ive been home Ive noticed that they NEVER stop working Im thrilled to have found such a good cleaning service and can give an honest Excellant AAAAA review since my house is always spotless after their work
5,Super I had hired House Doctors late summer 2018 to help at my sons family home after theyd gone through serious illness and been overwhelmed That job had gone SO well see my prior review I recently asked my son if theyd like to have that happen again They would indeed And so once again we are 100 pleased with every aspect of this housecleaning service Iwe would hire them again in a heartbeat Courteous professional thorough caring efficient are but a few of the accolades that fit Thank you so much Lori and Gail
5,All the guys who participated were friendly and professional They showed respect for our home They communicated with us on any changes needed but also listened to our input Pricing was very reasonable for the job I will use them again
3,I contacted this company requesting a deep house cleaning They were prompt in responding and setting up an appointment The price seemed reasonable for a deep clean and the two women showed up when promised In the initial text conversation I was instructed to make a list of everything I needed done which I did create One of the women reviewed the list multiple times throughout their time here but somehow managed to miss approximately 50 of what was listed Most of the half that was actually completed was decent work but not a deep clean by any standards Some shelves of a few different units were dusted remaining shelves of the same unit were untouched One of the women stood on our coffee table to dust a ceiling fan even though they brought a step stool They forgot their vacuum so they asked to use ours which was no problem but they only used it in 2 small areas One of the women told us that it didnt take much time because the house was not dirty but then I overheard the other say unprompted We are house cleaners not miracle workers If my house needed a miracle to be clean then why did the job take two hours I would have been happy to pay for more time if the things I asked for had been done We wont be using or recommending this companyin the future
5,House Doctors performed quality work for a very reasonable price The wok was completed efficiently and all areas left clear I ha Ltd a challenge finding a contractor to complete these small jobs but Mike came out and assured me that they could get it done Mike came out to review the work completed by his employee Mark who was very good at his work and ensured everything was completed to y satisfaction before I had to settle the bill I would hire them again for any project I have in the future
2,I want to be clear that the job was done well the person showed up on time and the person who did the work was very professional However what happened AFTER is the problem SInce I wanted to pay by credit card the workman told me he would have the office contact me to pay the bill Long story short I was literally chasing this company down for nearly a month to pay for the service rendered They told me they would call repeatedly then did not I could have lived with that but when I did finally reach them to pay the bill I wanted to schedule an estimate to get a ceiling repaired I was put on their schedule and that time came and went with no phone call or appearance of anyone Needless to say I hired another company and would recommend that anyone dealing with this one be very cautious
5,It was a big change from dark navy to creamy off white and they did an amazing job They arrived right on time They helped rehang the curtain rods and did a lot above and beyond what I would have expected I will recommend them to friends and family
4,Mike and his workers did a great job It seemed as though the ball was dropped by the front office I needed to call multiple times and the lady on the phone was pleasant but seemed a little disorganized Overall they did a great job and I would hire again
5,Courteous and prompt service in all the work throughout the year Exelent attention to detail and reponds promptly to manage the high quality of work
5,Mike and his team arrived promptly on the day of service and were friendly and professional The work was completed and Mike left but after seeing some pictures later in the day my fiancee wanted some changes made Mike made time to come back out the same evening to do the additional work and was still very friendly The banister looks great and is well built and we are very happy with it and Mikes professionalism I recommend House Doctors and will be using Mikes services again in the future
5,It was good It was excellent service They were nice they were pleasant Bill is very very nice person The way he talked and treated me I do like the way it turned out I would hire them again
5,Crew arrived at appointed time and all projects completed Very satisfied We will certainly use them again for any other repair needs
5,I was super impressed with the timeliness and ability to ask questions to help with project I was told what exact door I needed to order and dimensions which made the decision easy for someone like me who doesnt have time or skill to do these type projects The door removal was complicated due to how the previous door was put in by former owner The project took 6 hours due to it and I know that it was beyond what he estimated I offered to pay extra for the time and work that went into it and mike declined I would hire them for my next project I hesitated to write that part cause I know it helps business but dont want them to be selfishly  too busy for me Lol
5,Good work done Looks good and was completed quickly once started Cleanup was very good Communication could have been a little better but overall was good
5,Wonderful Mike is a very friendly guy and he basically helped me to feel less stressed about getting all this work done on the house in order to sell it He did everything I needed done and a great job I would definitely hire him admin
5,Very well As always the work was done as we were told it would be Mike  his crew were professional answered our questions and completed the jobs in a timely manner We were pleased with everything
5,Excellent  The house doctors were professional  did a thorough job
5,Excellent Workers were polite professional  successfully completed my project I will be using their service for future projects
5,I call these guys when ever I need anything from a chandelier hung to a floor replaced They are now my first call Love them
5,Well will be using them in the near future
5,Mark was great I would definitely have him again Very pleased with how my door turned out
4,Accomplished promptly and professionally I wanted to ask about something but they left before I could do so
1,This went horribly They first contacted me two days after I submitted my project need to Angies List That should have been my first sign of trouble I then described my issue in detail to the woman who sets up the appointments for Mike and we agreed they would come to my house on October 12th between 2  3 pm to look at project and quote it I told her this was an urgent matter as we cant currently use that bathroom because of the leak She assured me they could work quickly October 12th came and at 336 pm I received a call saying they couldnt make it out during the window because of another job No kidding it was already past the time they agreed to show up She then said they would come later that evening between 6  7 pm Of course they didnt come and said they would definitely come on Sunday two days later between 3  4 pm At this point I wasnt confident if they would ever show up Mike did ultimately show up to my house 5 minutes before 4 pm My father let him in to explain the issue Mike looked at the issue and said they dont do plumbing and left So after wasting two weeks of my time and missing two scheduled appointments they ultimately said they couldnt do the work Why couldnt they tell me that when I FIRST described the issue This was the worst experience ever Perhaps he is good at his job but their customer service was terrible Will never call again
5,Mike was attentive to our needs and answered all of our questions Various members of Mikes crew performed different parts of the repairs  painting ALL members of Mikes crew were courtesy  professional Based upon our positive experience we decided to hire Mike  his crew for additional services
4,Mike was very nice professional Was there when he said he would and did a ice job
5,Fantastic This was for my son  daughterinlaws home in another city where House Doctors is and they were wonderful to deal with both by phone and in person Great jobeverybodys SO happy Even the young kids arriving home from school went wideeyed saying Whoa This is super Not that anything was terrible before but health issues had prevented normal levels of cleaning for some time and House Doctors housecleaning took everything over the top Kudos The price was right for two people  three hours and I would hire again in a heartbeat if the occasion arises
5,Amazingly well Very pleased I hired this company to clean freshen and organize my sons family home after theyd faced many months of very serious illness I live in Florida but my sons family is in my home city so I am familiar with suburban locations there This company was courteous and kind helpful to the Nth degree efficient and thorough Their pricing was appropriate in my opinion and I would hire them again in a heartbeat should the need arise again They cleaned a threelevel residence 3 bedrooms2 baths  top floor kitchendining roomplayroomliving room2 bedrooms1 bath  main floor rec roombar arealaundry  lowest level Two people for approx 4 hours as agreed Son and family thrilled As am I And I want to apologize for being so long delayed in writing this up
5,They were professional friendly polite and thorough When done it looked like a new room They left everything spotless
5,Im very happy with the job the House Doctors did for me We started taking wallpaper down from a bedroom and realized it was too large of a project for us to do DIY The walls needed repairs and the rest of the wallpaper needed to be removed Mike was very professional He gave me a quote and started a few weeks later It took one week to complete just as promised And final payment was about the quoted price Im now going to get another quote for a bathroom remodeling
5,The crew was both professional and friendly They also kept us informed when they found something unexpected I would say it went very well These guys worked very hard and definitely know their craft
5,Went well The deck and front steps look very nice They matched the stain perfectly on both
5,Work went smoothly over several days Very good attention to detail
5,The only reason for the B in responsiveness is that there was a miscue between their office and the owner as to the appointment date and time Date we were given was 626 The owner had our appointment for 627 so we waited all day on 626 for nothing Now the owner Mike did call us the evening of 626 and apologized profusely for the error He had two young men come out on 627 and they were very nice respectful and hard working They did a great job even in the rain I would very much recommend The House Doctors
5,Everything went well as promised The crew had to replace rotten wood on the porch pillars and we suggested that they replace damaged lattice before painting Mike added in the extra work but kept the cost affordable I have been dealing with the house doctors for at least 10 years I will continue to use their services and recommend them to anyone who wants to deal with an honest company that does quality work
5,They were very professional they showed up on time my porch looks beautiful all of my neighbors are giving me compliments on my yard I would say it went great
4,They did a good job but got confused about the address and so missed the first appointment Had to reschedule
5,Excellent High quality work all requested details addressed crew was easy to work with good communications all work done in a very timely manner
5,I am very happy with the results The porch looks beautiful Jim did a good job
5,The owners wife is an angel She was extremely accommodating even though I contacted them with an urgent short time frame they made it happen My daughters room was perfectly painted with paint to spare I would have given THD all As but the painter who arrived at my home was not very friendly when I spoke to him on the phone He was slightly arrogant With that being said he did an awesome job with no mess At the end of the day I got what I paid for The owners wife friendly disposition and great customer service made up for my interaction with the painter Maybe he was having a bad day I would definitely hire them again
5,We had a playground and basketball hoop installed poorly by another company Mike and his team came and fixed the area to make it safe and look beautiful They added playground mulch and framed out the area nicely We are very happy with the work
5,There was a laundry list of small to moderate repairs needed for pointofsale inspection plus a little drywall refinishing from a recent plumbing issue Mike and the crew at The House Doctors handled scheduling with both tenants all supplies and materials and completed the repairs pretty quickly The price was a bit higher than I was hoping but to have someone who could handle all the aspects of the job painting windows small electrical minor masonry downspout siding pressure washing was very convenient
5,The project went well It turns out that there was more work involved than initially scoped and Mike was fair about the price of that work His quote was detailed clear and complete He was very responsive and helpful His staffperson made sure to clean up after the project and was very friendly The only reason that we rated a B on price was that it wasnt the least expensive proposal on the table but it was worth paying extra to make sure the job was done correctly
5,When the tiles in my 1952 Bungalow home starting crumbling off the shower walls I attempted to correct the situation with a DIY surround Finally the surround started to show tears and mold see ugly before photos and I got estimates for a partial and full bath remodel I happened upon The House Doctors and they completely transformed the room I could not afford to remodel everything at once so they accommodated my budget by completing the project in 2 phases something other companies would not do The room is beautiful and just as importantly the shower is now safe for my elderly mother to use see after photos
5,Very well Lori and Kim were very pleasant and professional and did a thorough job They brought their own supplies My furniture and mirrors shine and the bathrooms are so clean and smell so good
5,Did a great job on soffit which was very high up on very tall house blended repair in perfectly with existing molding to the point you wouldnt know it was repaired unless you knew it was rotted Repaired bed room ceiling and Spanish style plaster work perfectly and repainted so you would never know it was not original ceiling
5,The service was exceptional at every level Lori worked with me to reschedule when the mailbox was not delivered on time The gentleman who assembled and installed the mailbox did a great job Im very pleased
5,This was my first experience with a professional house cleaning service and it was fantastic Everything was done to perfection Ill be calling House Doctors again and have already recommended them to several friends
5,Very well Was a big job in that it was customized for us The entire bathroom had to be changed to make it accessible for a walker It is beautiful and functional Everything we requested was done Chris and Pat were always pleasant and professional and kept us informed of any changes They were helpful and made good suggestions
5,Lori and Erin are true professionals They got right to work and stuck to their tasks When they were done everything sparkled and was as clean as a whistle They saved me much time and labor I am completely satisfied I for sure would hire them again And I will also recommend them to others
3,My provider was limited for time because I had a doctors appointment but the work that was done was not thorough My bedroom was supposedly cleaned however the large closet floor was never done and the window sills were also not cleaned  I had to remind her She cleaned the bathroom but neglected to clean the fixtures in the shower I would have assumed she would know what to do She did leave a followup call to complete the amount of time paid for but I have had some medical problems and did not call her back  yet
5,It went well Jobs were finished up as quickly as possible In some cases workers even stayed late to beat the weather coming in
5,Mark was very prompt and professional and the new sills looked great Would definitely hire them again
4,We were ecstatic that this could be done at such a reasonable cost The workmanship was topnotch Very pleased with our contractor
2,The roof repair estimation is twice of another company When I told the Representative the next day when she called She hung up the phone on me while I was talking Wont recommend to anybody in the future
5,Jim did a beautiful job I am happy I had the work done Porch looks great
5,A gentleman from The House Doctors came out and luckily the problem was not extensive and within a few hours he was able to cut away the damaged wood trim determine the wood underneath was fine and the repair was very well done at a reasonable price We are having The House Doctors return soon to install a handrail on the modern style stairs to our basement that have no rail repair 2 doorknobs and clean our gutters
5,Good the ladies were nice and worked efficiently I have so much more to be done and it was nice to have them give me a break Thank you
5,Great Mark was punctual worked efficiently and was knowledgeable in all areas of work performed
5,Good communication Very personable Job completed in a timely manner Complete clean up Thank You
5,As usual with this company The work is excellent the clean up perfect the staff polite
5,Very satisfied with results of the work as well as interactions with the House Doctors on bid scheduling and job completion Jim had excellent work ethic was timely efficient easy to work with and did an excellent job
5,Mike came right away to give us an estimate and was able to complete the work within a week Very pleased
5,I am relieved to have this work done
3,No work was performed as no quote was received I cant actually say if I would hire them again because I did not hire them a first time I have nothing on which to base a review of their work only their responsiveness and professionalism
1,A contractor from this company came to my home to do an estimate for the repairs covered by my homeowners insurance After that I havent heard from them My calls  emails were not returned Have ended up hiring someone else Am not going to call this company ever again and dont recommend
5,Had to work around the weather but they stayed in contact and scheduling was not a problem Very happy with outcome It looks good provider was professional and pleasant worked well and took care of everything
5,The team did a fantastic job cleaning the house They were friendly hard working and willing to work around a contractor that was running behind I highly recommend them for your cleaning needs
1,called left message never received a call back
5,The repairs were done very professionally
5,This was a wood rot coupon appointment I was glad that this company hung in there with me through a few obstacles One was that my presence was sporadic due to a pressing family illness The other was that we had to interrupt work a couple of times to eradicate yellow jacket nests At the end though I now have three solid windows painted and well sealed Thank you House Doctors
4,When I fist bought the coupon a nice lady called to schedule but I was not yet ready She called another time and I needed to get back to her Then I called several times and could not get through left messages They did finally call back and we are all set up now
5,Great the guy did a good job It was mostly for safety I feel better that its fixed
5,They were very professional and responded to my request for additional work
5,Great job by Mark Punctual polite professional
5,Showed up right on time tarped up the whole area got right to work When he left everything was meticulously cleaned given that it was drywall repair thats not a joke Very happy about the job
4,Okay Contractor didnt bring enough supplies and had to leave to pick up more
5,Arrived on time got right to work If you hire them make sure you have a long list They work fast and it is surprising how much can be done
1,Awful We called repeatedly to set up the service They never called us back The last time we called the number was for Perfect Power Wash They have our money and we have nothing
3,For some reason he completed just a portion of the job and neglected to finish it 100 which I discovered when I arrived home it was an outside task I just prorated the payment to him to be done with it
5,Mark and Jim did an excellant job They answered all questions moved and protected furniture cleaned up took me to purchase material arrived on time and worked really hard to get the job done
5,Very well Very nice ladies and they work very hard
1,Was contacted immediately via email and an appointment was scheduled for three weeks later Estimates were to be emailed but were not received despite several messages left at both office and cell numbers After Angies List reimbursed the amount paid for the original tuck pointing deal a proposal without detail was finally received actually one month to the date of the original appointment The proposal was declined via email and work was completed by another contractor
5,Job was done exactly as Mike said it would be
5,Very well Everything was completed properlyfloors bathrooms kitchen living and dining room
4,Did everything I wanted him to Only hiccup was he was sent to my old address instead of the new address where the work was to be performed
5,He was on time called ahead and told us what we needed Excellent work
5,Outstanding quality workmanship from The House Doctors two man team very prompt professional courteous and timely execution and the crew paid attention to very detail of the job
5,Very efficient and job looked great when completedneeded a deck of my sliding glass doors to the outside in the backyardthey built it stained and painted it and we are very pleased with the outcome
5,Great They determined and solved the problem
3,They came out inspected the deck and furniture and said the washing wouldnt do any damage however after the job was done there was few spots on the deck where the stain had been removed exposing the wood Overall they got the job done so i cant complain
5,Jim assessed the problem explained what needed to be done and what materials were needed He worked within the contracted time and completed the work with neatness and precision
5,They were ontime courteous and professional Did a great job Ill definitely hire again
5,Great l had final approval on all completed repairs Good to find a company that would handle small jobs
3,women was very nice but had to reschedule on me last minute 2 different times She finally showed up on our 3rd appointment I asked her to only focus on a couple select rooms and just do a deep cleaning on those but it was very surface level
1,The contractor was 45 minutes late Instead of repairing the wall he decided to cover it with 14 inch drywall But he said I had to buy the drywall screws and spackling before he could start I had planned to let him into the house and then go to work for a few hours Instead we drove to Home Depot where I bought two sheets of drywall a 5gallon bucket of mud and a box of drywall screws Then I helped him load his truck which wasnt big enough for the drywall so both sheets got damaged when he squished the sheets into his truck His work looks ok but he took the leftover screws and the 5gallon bucket of mud it was probably 75 full when he was done
5,The carpenterhandyman work excellent Confusion at the office
5,Came to the house measured for wood trim Bought trim  installed Did nice job on trim  door
1,I made an appointment with House Doctors for 8142017 They never showed up to complete the job I left two messages with them on 8142017 about not showing up They have made no attempt to contact me about the job that I hired them to complete in my home
2,I purchased a deal on Angies and never was contacted by the company I submitted the Angies List scheduling request form emailed their direct email address and called and left a message After a month of no contact back I asked Angies List for a refund
5,I hired The House Doctors for the wood rot package I thought there was going to be a problem as no one showed up at the arranged time and no one called After I called in twice Jim the man who was actually going to do the work called and explained that his coworker had had an emergency I was pleased to hear that he could come later that day I thought it was a bit odd that the office never call to explain or apologize for the inconvenience but had their pro call and no follow up call either Thus the lower grade on professionalism Their pro Jim was great He did a nice job and I am somewhat picky and he was quick He accomplished more than I thought he would in the four hours allotted I really appreciate too that he deferred from any finish work as that is not in his wheelhouse rather than hack his way through those Halelujah
5,They did an excellent job even adding a few extra touches here and there ie paid to paint upstairs shutters but also painted downstairs shutters to match made slight changes to back deck at my request with no added cost The workers were friendly but focused they worked hard from the time they arrived between 1030am and 1130 am till the time they left at the end of the day usually 530ish pm but once as late as 730ish pm Their workmanship was superb I am definitely happy with this company I will definitely hire House Doctors again for any work on the house we may need in the future
5,Very detail oriented  professional
5,They did a very good job and cleaned up everything The guys were really courteous and communicated their progress throughout the four days it took to complete  Most of the contract details were communicated by email and they were always timely getting back to me with any answers or changes I requested Pricing was slightly higher then quoted prices I received but the quality of work more than made up for that and they were willing to work with me a little
5,Great he was professional and courteous
5,Two ladies and came to clean our apartment They worked very well together and were very organized They mopped vacuumed dusted clean the ceiling fans and whatever else needed done They used a Dyson vacuum cleaner which was very highly rated on consumer reports I am planning to use them again They are scheduled to come July 29 r
1,Took 2 weeks of missed and not responded t messaging to finally schedule appointment for cleaning They didnt show nor call
1,I bought the  149 wood restoration deal on July 31st scheduled the work for August 30th They didnt show up the day of the appointment and didnt call to cancel or to apologize I called the company twice left messages and they never called me back The worst is that Angies List doesnt want to refund the money because is past 30 days even though is not my fault The work was scheduled 30 days after I bought the deal because of their availability
5,Work was done as agreed Wood was replaced and all areas cleaned up Four hours was the original deal wood rot only took about an hour so he readily offered to do other work Tightened stair rail and even got out onto roof of porch and caulked sky light window that was dripping with hard rain VERY professional helpful and didnt make me feel stupid which is important to me Thank you Angies List for helping me find this great company I would definitely use this company again
5,Punctual professional efficient Also responsive to my specific needs
4,It took forever to contact them and get a response They came one day to look at it and told me they would have it done within 3 weeks They actually came the next day and performed the work
1,Their discounted prices are reflected of the service I will not work with this firm in the future because of a complete lack of professionalism an inability to answer the phone or respond in a timely fashion to a call or email and for not showing up to an appointment They wasted my time and I assure you will have no problem doing the same to yours I would stay away at all costs even if pricing is slightly more expensive at another provider It was one of the single worst customer service experiences I have had to deal with outside of the airlines or Time Warner Cable There are two phone numbers that are consistently not manned by a customer service representative making it nearly impossible to get things done punctual or professionally To schedule the appointment I left several messages via email and over the phone before I received a call back  which came after 830PM when I was not available I called back first thing in the morning and didnt receive a followup call until the following week When we setup a time to conduct the work the window of arrival was between 9301130 I was unable to contact the company the morning of to confirm service times or narrow the window I waited the 2 hours and no one showed up to the property I tried to call to see if they were on their way or if I needed to reschedule but again was unable to reach anyone at the firm
5,Clean up was done wellBoth contractors did good work kept things neat do during their workThey did not rush their work therefore quality was good
1,No one showed up on scheduled appointment day
5,Very well The workers were not rushed but performed their tasks thoughtfully and thoroughly I was particularly pleased that a few extras not included in the original quote were done to finish the job I had not made a request for the extras but was thrilled to see that Jim had taken the initiative make the finished product look great Mike the owner was responsive and communicated effectively I would hire them again
5,The person arrived within the time frame we were told I cant remember his name I asked him if he could take a photo of the damage so we could see what it looked like He took his cell phone and took a photo of it Once he started the job he kept us informed of any issues he ran into He was very friendly and helpful I would use them again
1,When they initially contacted me after purchase I was told they didnt have any openings for 3 weeks and I scheduled that The week of the appointment they called on Mon to cancel the Wed appointment because they said it might rain it didnt They rescheduled for the next week now 4 weeks since purchase On the day of the appointment no one showed up and no one called After I called and left messages they called to reschedule and said they didnt have any appointments for 4 more weeks that would be 8 weeks after purchase I said that was unacceptable they said they would call back and I never heard from them
1,The process started out well House Doctors came highly recommended and I knew they could do all of the work I needed I met with Mike who took good notes and talked through the job and seemed interested in the job Unfortunately Mike never provided an estimate despite a followup phone call I was unable to proceed with this company
5,Mark was conscientious took 2 hours cleaned up
5,It went very well No problems since then
5,I was very happy with the results and will use them again and recommend them
5,The plumber that I had worked with for many years from this company was not available The plumber they sent out was good we just had a little problem getting dates and times set The plumber was very knowledge and worked hard to get to the root of the problem and well as providing advice as to what is need in the future to prevent this problem 
5,Mark was great Worked efficiently and did a nice job
2,They came to your house without any kind of identification They did not clean up after It wasnt the best of jobs
5,Mike the owner was prompt in providing an estimate He offered suggestions which would enhance the work we wanted done so we agreed to include that They were able to schedule us quickly because of a cancellation and Mark and Jim arrived on time even earlier than promised which worked out well for us They installed two new handrails with backboards for each on the walls of both stairwells They stained the one to the second floor with a stain which matched the sashes on our windows Additionally they painted the walls and ceiling going from first to second floor At my request they left the backboards and rails to the basement unfinished They repaired drywall in first floor bathroom and painted the walls Then installed the decorative grab bar We found the quality of their work to be excellent
5,The crew was open to communication and feedback They helped solve some problems such as unexpected chipping due to uneven cabinets They were cheerful and professional I would use them for the whole house if I had the money
1,Called and set up an appointment On the day they were to come out no one showed Called both the 440 and 216 numbers shown in their ad to ask if they were going to be late or if they wanted to reschedule another day Got voice mail at both numbers and left messages Its been two weeks and still no response By some of the reviews I would have to guess that they do good work when they show up but a quality provider should be based on more than just the work performed Professionalism is also measured by courtesy dependability and consistently
5,Great I am also getting estimates on future projects as I would hire them again
5,The House Doctors cleaners showed up on time 2 for 15 hrs and did an excellent job of refreshing the house  it smelled great after they left I would definitely hire them again
5,excellent job fast and thorough pleasant and friendly
3,1st guy was done by a guy who was full of confidence but left pieces of glass everywhere on the ground We didnt see it at 1st because dry leaves were all over the ground but there were shards of glass everywhere very dangerous The 2nd window was done weeks later by another guy  it was fine all picked up
5,It went very well He was very detailed and put the stand together very professionally It looks great in my living room
5,Instead of having to call one company for one thing another for something else and yet another for another thing I just hand them my list of work and they get it done Ive used them numerous times the approximate cost of service for this review is for the latest work they did This time the work included regrouting exterior brick and a complete replacement of an asphalt driveway including adding drainage and hauling away the old asphalt The pricing is in line with what I expected to pay based on the amount of work needed this time and I got compliments on multiple occaisions from the city inspectors on the quality of the work they did including the driveway replacement work Theyre good about working around my schedule and that of my tenants I work second shift and Mike will meet with me after I get off work And they schedule with my tenants to make sure work that requires they enter the tenants place is done when the tenants want it to be done
5,Excellent Prompt efficient did everything I asked and I was very satisfied
3,I called customer service and was refunded but still hanging for work I need done
5,Awesome The workers were kind polite professional and very hard working I will be using them again
5,They were very professional On time and worked hard Was nice to have the areas cleaned that I needed focused on
5,2 women came to clean within 24 hours of the purchase and did an excellent job The work was thorough and they were especially considerate of the fact that I was a cancer patient and coordinated their work around my need for rest during the 3 hour period they were there Highly recommend their work and their consideration
5,Mike Vecchio is the perfect mix of friendly professionalism and his quote for the job was what I thought it would be so I accepted his bid right there and he fixed my siding the next day His company does everything related to home maintenance and repair and I was happy to find that his brother does landscaping too I look forward to doing business with this company in the future Thanks Mike
5,Awesome service Well worth the money I will definitely be calling them for more work in my house
3,The handyman acted put out by anything I said Door handle removed to try and replace on storm door put back in after not acceptable replacement Door handle found a few weeks later on the porch I have never had this problem before I wanted an updated version which is why we were trying to replace I let the boss know No response
3,Hurried through it and would not finish the ceiling at my request Came about 12 hour late and then took a lunch for about 20 minutes and then acted as if he had to hurry to next job So terribly unprofessional I only got 23 of my time and I found chipping on the wall under some dry wall he had repaired Texted his boss and cool was the reply Apparently he thinks this passes as good service as well
1,I initially called The House Doctors and left a message to schedule an estimate Laurie called me back a couple days later and gave me a different phone number to call to schedule I called this number several times over a three day period and nobody ever picked up and the voice mail was full So I called the main number again Laurie got back to me and scheduled an estimate for Monday March 27th between 12 PM I drove an hour to get to the house where the work was needed I arrived at 1230 PM and sat in a lawn chair in plain sight in the driveway reading a book from 1230 until 230 Nobody showed up and nobody called or texted to say they were running late or wouldnt be able to make it that day I had to turn around and drive another hour back to my current residence Laurie left me a voicemail two days later looking to get me scheduled for an estimate as if I was never scheduled in the first place No mention of the missed commitment I work full time and go to school full time so my time is very limited I wasted an entire day of my valuable spring break on an estimate I never received
5,They come in time and keep working for three hours for the move out cleaning They are very polite and did a great job
2,This episode was disappointing at best I hired a cleaning service to do things I am not physically able to do with my disabilities What I dont like about Angies List service is they take my payment first before the contractor shows up Sure if they cant do the job they can turn it down and my money is refunded But if they accept the job and then do it lousey where am I I spoke with owner prior to making appointment I was assured this type of cleaning was not an extra charge item I was also told on the phone that the ad was wrong it was TWO 2 people for 3 hours I offered my cleaning supplies Lysol Pine Sol Comet cleanser bleach I also offered to presoak this mess with wet towels for a day before her arrival to facilitate its removal She says no need She wants to scrape it with the scraper I provide and she almost took home with her in the end She wants to use her Simple Green OK In the back of my mind Im thinking if I have a basement covered in wet towels and she turns down the job well now I have to deal with all the wet towels Owner tells me she has 6 dogs so is accustomed to cleaning pet mess In my mind that means she understands the concept of getting it all clean and deodorized otherwise the pet will return to that place over and over to poo again Owner shows up alone for appointment with a list of explanations why her helper called off I dont care its not my problem Why did she not call to reschedule 2020 hindsight I should have told her upon arrival either come back when your helper is with you or work here for 6 hours yourself or give me 3 hours of your time for 12 the original price Otherwise it starts to smell a lot like bait and switch I try very hard not to micro manage people I hire I do give very clear specific instruction what I want done and i make suggestions as to how to accomplish that task in a time efficient manner Then I walk away let them work and check in to see the progress every 90 minutes or so I think it is very unprofessional for a vendor to make small talk with a customer and start telling me all about your medical problems and operations if you are not physically able to do the job find another line of work I started in my kitchen by showing her TWO 2 buckets of cat box scoopings that needed to go to the garbage can Once they were empty she could use them in the basement to clean up that mess I specifically said One is full so is very heavy You can just slide it across the floor instead of picking it up Thankfully I found out before she left for the day she had not taken it out and I insisted she do so She claimed she didnt see it Um scuse me after I showed it to you As we made our way down the basement steps i pointed out with my cane the cat mess on the steps that needs to be cleaned Once down there I continued to point out areas the cats had pooped in including under my bed and in the basement lav I specifically said do not worry about cleaning the laundry area as they have not pooed there I also said cleaning the basement toilet and offered my Comet cleanser No she is going to use her stuff After 90 mins I smell something orange and Im told come look Im told the orange is some sort of enzyme cleaner for pet mess I find she has wasted a lot of time moving items out of my laundry area to clean the floor i told her not to do She claims there was cat poo between the buckets and paint cans that had been stacked there There is no way a cat will wedge its butt into a tight space like that They look for a place to dig a hole and do their thing then cover it The floor is so soaking wet light is reflecting off it Worse yet she moved the laundry room stuff to the cat box area on top of the wet floor so it would take weeks to dry not to mention mold and mildew I insisted she move everything back to the laundry area and then gave her a work towel to dry the floor She tried to throw away my towel During the last hour I became the helper in an effort to get the rugs vacuumed that i needed done so that I could wash them its a 2 person job This person seems to have an aversion to vacuum cleaners Although I offered the use of all 3 of mine her first suggestion was to sweep these throw rugs with a broom Seriously She also insisted on sweeping the basement with a broom After doing those rugs I was in a lot of pain and soaked in sweat the scenario I was trying to avoid by paying money for a service About 12 hours after she left I went back to the basement so I could see the floor better after some of the water had evaporated I was greeted with a fresh pile of cat poo at the bottom of the steps No surprise why With the reflection gone from the excess water it was obvious not all the poo was scrubbed off the floor Sure it smelled of orange but the cats will still smell that poo and think its a place to go the steps are not cleaned a large area of dried poo by the bathroom is not clean There is poo under my bed and in front of my shower The toilet well it looks as though it was wiped out with a dry rag There are still black mold marks that could easily be scrubbed off with Comet and a sponge Your perfumy foamy stuff isnt going to cut it Disappointed in North Olmsted
5,They were great they showed up when they said they would and cleaned up after themselves
5,Great They did several small jobs and he was not a clock watcher Neat and did a great job of cleaning up
5,The cleaning was thorough and well done
5,They showed up on time and were very friendly and their work was excellent Jim was a very helpful and skilled worker and our stairs look great Definitely worth the money and would hire them again
5,Really well  the man who actually did the work did a great job I did have some trouble getting an appointment for the second visit multiple visits due to materials needing to dry before the next step in the process could continue I would call them again for any job that I didnt have a super tight timeline on
5,Good Came to see what materials were needed then picked them up for me I really appreciated this
5,Everything went well with no problems
1,We played phone tag for a while and then they would not call back at all When we call the number now its Pristine Clean If we cant get the service wed like our money back
3,The primer shows through the tan paint because he didnt paint it well He put 2 coats of primer and only 1 coat of paint I have paneling that goes part way up the wall and the junction where the painted wall meets the paneling he left a white stripe around He didnt bring the paint down to meet the paneling so there is a white line that goes around it I called to tell them the work wasnt done and that you could see the white paint through the tan paint He said they would only fix it if my Home Insurance company agreed to pay them more I didnt even care if he repainted all of the work I just wanted him to touch up where you can see the white paint through the tan paint
5,The work was done very efficiently
5,Great They arrived on time had clear understanding of project gave true estimate of time and cost We were kept informed of any issues and involved an all decisions Work was perfectly performed clean and neat They matched existing wood stain painted well and worked around 20 years of basement clutter without a word of complaint All were polite and friendly
5,Great experience Jim was very detailed Will use again
4,It was cold out and rainy I think they guy didnt necessarily want to be here early I probably should have rescheduled them another day They cancelled once or twice The work that he did do was very good Theyre not as professional Their price and work was excellent Maybe I will use them again
1,i purchased a coupon for drywall repair on angies list i needed my ceiling fixed because of a water issue in the upstairs shower leaking down into the kitchen i had a lot of trouble getting the guy to come out when promised and when he finally did the repair he performed was actually a disaster he speckled up the damaged ceiling and when it dried it was full of huge cracks i ended up going to Ace Hardware and consulting an employee and fixed it myself for free The guy was super apologetic about not coming back out to fix it and had an excuse about his van being broken into and he lost my phone numberNot possible but the funniest part was at the end of the phone call when he asked me to give a good review on angies list LMAO
5,Everything was done quickly and efficiently
2,The guy came in with a really bad attitude as if he did not like his job He used a curse word and did a very sloppy job and dripped the drywall stuff down the walls There was stuff all over my kitchen and floor I found it two weeks later I would never use them again
1,After numerous contacts company came up with excuses and never showed up
4,He noticed the steps and offered to stabilize it He said he had some spare wood in the truck and offered to stabilize it for me without additional charge Even though he offered to do the stabilization of the steps he didnt paint the new wood I would have appreciated him asking if he could paint the new wood to match the steps
4,Fine The quality of the work was not all that great
1,They did not show for the first appointmentclaimed the tech was in the ER When the tech did show he looked around The first thing he said was that he could only apply material that dayit wouldnt dry in time He also wanted me to supply drywall topping even though the agreement states that the contractor would supply it He had a bag of quickdry in his truck which he didnt want to usethis material would have dried in 20 minutes so he could have sanded it He just acted like he didnt want to be there He worked 2 hours said he was done and that I would have to make another appointment to get the project finished and left I called twice to speak with the owner but have not received a call back Later in the day I walked outside and noticed my hunting trail camera was missing His truck was parked 15 feet away I did not see who took the camera A very disappointing experience I still have an unfinished project
5,The painters came back and did my sons room That was a little less The first guy I used a coupon for but then again it didnt cover all the work This guy was great He actually did some extra work in the bathroom for me interms of fixing the drywall He installed a new shade for me He actually textured the ceiling where he fixed it in my kitchen So there was a bit of correction that he did I was very pleased He was not the painter though You can use all the same scores as for the painters because I combined the two of them They were all As but the responsiveness I would use them again
5,It went really well Everything is find  we are ready for the winter
2,It went over the 1st day  4500 but was never finished The drywall was service was started and not completed on the ceiling The House Doctor was supposed to call back on 915 Several attempts were made to reach them but they never made good on it
4,The problem with House Doctors is scheduling They dont get back to you very quickly and it can multiple calls to get a response The last time they were supposed to send 2 guys for two separate deals I purchased they sent onewho was very good who could only fill one order No one called to let me know and no one has return a call I placed 2 days ago to try and reschedule
2,The work I wanted done on my deck would be best completed by taking the 129 and put it toward tearing out and putting in a new deck He measured and discussed how the material would be purchased before the project would start He would put the order in at Home Depot and I would go in and pay for the material needed to build this deck and rails I told him that I would be able to get a discount at Home Depot if he put it in my partners name He is a Army veteran and would be able to get the discount on the material He said he would call me to get that information I even was pro active and called him a week later to see when he planned to call the order into Home Depot After that call from me to him I never heard from anyone No call at all Then on October 6 at 930am I got a call telling me they were on the way to do the tear out This was not what we had discussed How were they going to build the deck I needed to know a week before they came to coordinate the purchase with my partner Did they expect me to rush to get the material in one day Again this was not how it was supposed to be done I told the carpenter who called me NOT to come It already was messed up I wasnt going to let them start after seeing the way the initial agreement wasnt even binding He said he had an injury and the Office at House Doctors was supposed to have called me NO ONE called me I did receive a call from the owner the same afternoon I told him they really screwed up this deal He said to tell you that his guy stayed here for an hour and when I called you to tell you that I would be happy to get a refund for 2 hours since the man who came initially did stay about an hour I would like a refund
5,The carpenter was professional helpful and pleasant and cleaned up after himself He also worked steadily and did not waste time He called ahead of time to let me know when he was coming
1,Unfortunately my experience with House Doctors didnt work well because the specialist came and he couldnt finish the job First he applied the patches to the hole in our the backyard and he wouldnt paint it because he said that it was too high and then he said if we keep him then we need to have some kind of contract for a certain job So I agreed for him to do the job but then the timing didnt work for them so after a couple of months of delay basically they called me back and they reset an appointment to go the store to buy some wood but then they called me and said that the car was broken and next time theyd call me two or three weeks after Usually when contractors call you that the car is broken you can read that they have some other commitments So I decided not to go to these people and this company So Im looking for a new specialist to finish the job They didnt finish it because they said that the voucher I paid for their job was valid only for one visit And if I needed a second visit they said that I should have a new contract with them for some serious repairs and I agreed but uhm they replaced the deck but it never worked out because they were delaying and delaying and their car was broken and so I decided that these people are totally unreliable I would give them an F overall because they failed to come on time I asked them also to send me the contract for the service that they needed if they wanted to do a bigger job they need to send me the contract They never sent me any documents to sign So I think its a failure and I think its really unreliable when they say Lets meet and the car is broken Thats not the first time when contractors tell you that the car is broken They always have problems with the car right All of them For me the price was A I like the price I have no rating for the quality because the job was never finished
5,They did some additional work for me too
5,The person who came out did a great job He was on time friendly skilled efficient and professional He replaced the window sill and painted it He also caulked and painted parts of a second window and did an excellent job When I tried to make an appointment the answering service was disorganized and not very professional It was difficult to reach a live person This part of the service needs improvement
4,Tim was very professional and extremely courteous After he left I noticed several areas where paint was on the woodwork around doors I wish he would have taped around them He did tell me if I found anything to call and he would fix it I did it myself because I didnt want the paint to dry
4,Went well other than the service person needed to go purchase additional supplies Would have thought there should have been an ample amount of patching compound brought
5,Wainscotting needed to be replace so I had a longer visit and cancelled the special offer Tim did my work and he is very knowledgeable The work was reasonably priced It turned out that I had some mold in one corner and dry wall needed to be replaced also That was all done and done well
5,Im very satisfied with their service
4,Jim was fantastic He was polite fast skilled and did an excellent job The 2 window sills look beautiful The only problems is getting in touch with the people who do the scheduling I think they are overwhelmed and dont have a receptionist to take calls So you have to play phone tag to schedule an appointment It would help if one could communicate with them via email and schedule an appointment online I had a coupon so the price was right
5,Jim was great He did a beautiful and efficient job This only problem is that the office did not call me back promptly They need to fix this part of the business
5,We had a great experience While the initial estimate appointment had to be changed by one day we were notified in plenty of time and was not an inconvenience for us Tim performed the estimate and we agreed to hire The House Doctors for the work He additionally purchased the supplies needed on that first day as well We set the day for the work about a week away and he and his able helper arrived a couple hours later than scheduled It was clear that Tim was proficient in all types of home repair He did electrical and plumbing tasks carpentry and painting All were done exactly as we had hoped and the work was done in the amount of time estimated I would absolutely hire this company again Please note that the approximate cost of service includes an Angies List Deal I purchased for two of the hours of work
4,They were great They did a fine job They were nice guys They came and did what they said they were going to do efficiently My interaction with them was fine He was busy but he got here and did the work He stayed late to get it done The work turned out fine What they did was though they put up the mud they used a longer setting compound The problem with that is thats where all the dust come from I was a little disappointed that they have a 99 deal to repair drywall but they cant stand it which left me to stand it
5,Appointment was scheduled promptly and work was performed efficiently and with good quality
5,It went well  did a good job and I purchased a little more time price given in advance Would recommend
5,They replaced the fence post and the fence looks great
5,Due to our home remodel running behind schedule we did not use the deal I would not hesitate to purchase another deal from the House Doctors in the future They were prompt to call to schedule our work
1,He answered the phone without the name of the business and made it pretty clear pretty quickly that he wasnt interested in my business probably because the first thing I told him was a small job too far away Not so great listening skillscustomer service Not sure this company should be listed under handymen I was so put off by his tonereaction that I felt the need to put in a review for the next person that might have a smaller job on the west side  I wouldnt bother calling I am in the real estate business too so who knows what this call could have led to On a positive note  at least he answered the phone
1,AMAZINGat first They are excellent cleaners Ive no complaints in that regard But things changed once we left them the glowing Angies List review I knew we were a tough assignment  laundry for a family of four in addition to standard house cleaning  and I knew Kim and the crew were struggling to find a way to get it done One moment theyd tell me they werent sure it was doable The next theyd found a way to make it work and everything was fine After leaving the review though it just got more extreme One moment I was getting angry notes and voicemails and when Id call which I always did to ask what I could do to help make the situation better everything was GREAT again and I was the nicest customer ever Then the next week thered be another angry note or voicemail I shouldnt have put up with this but I didnt want to go through another round of interviewing cleaning companies Im a big believer in working problems out and building relationships and so I kept trying to make this work from my end even making sure the new washing machine I bought would meet the needs and wants of the cleaning team And every time they were satisfieduntil they werent Finally I received a long and condescending voicemail laying out all that was wrong with my house and with the job informing me theyd taken pictures Im sorrywhat and telling me not to bother calling  they were done with me and would not change their minds Look I get it Ours was a tough job tougher than either I or they expected and despite their best efforts they couldnt get it all done Sure we had a previous cleaning team that was able to accomplish all of this for less money and had no complaints about our house nor felt the need to take photographs of our home without our permission as a form of threat but whatever Had we been able to have a real conversation about this something could have been worked out but I never had the opportunity Either things were GREAT or they were TERRIBLE no room to troubleshoot when things are that bipolar If youre looking for a one time clean I fully endorse these people Despite my clear frustration with the situation they are topnotch cleaners who do a thorough job I give them credit for that and thank them But they do not have the mettle for long term arrangements These are not people you can build a relationship with troubleshoot issues with or depend upon in the long run I expect a long reply to this review laying out everything that was wrong with our house and with the job which by the way felt extremely insulting hurtful and threatening in terms of the photographs Once again I did all I could to oblige them was always kind and understanding with concerns expressed and never once said no to anything they suggested or asked for I get that the job as originally laid out wasnt one they ultimately felt they could keep up with despite their best efforts I wouldnt leave a bad grade for We tried but it just cant work Sorry Thats not the issue The bipolar nature of these exchanges the condescending tones the threat of photographs  and the quitting out of nowhere when everything was presumably great as of our last communicationthats what rubbed me the wrong way and has left me concerned for their future customers
5,Very well for the most Be sure you know that the handyman first assesses the materials needed for the job then goes to the nearest Lowes or Home Depot to buy it and you of course have to pay for it
1,I purchased a deal and scheduled an appointment I called them three or four times and they never called back to let me know if they can perform the service or not
1,To use an old movie line  what we have here is failure to communicate Left 3 voice mails used online scheduling have not heard or seen any type of communication Will be asking Angie to cancel
4,There estimate was extremely high They were polite and helpful it was just the price that I found excessive
2,I have not heard nor have I received an email with the quotes I called Mikes cell phone left a message no return call I called the office and again left voice mail and no return call
3,The guy did a nice job of it but he took a lot longer He was putzing around a bit but he did a nice job for what I needed So I was fine with it I think he could have got it done with the time allotted There was an additional charge because they said that if it went over the three hours there is going to be so much an hour I think there was an extra 60 for another hour For the 99 considering it was another 60 I guess the price was fine because it went an hour longer and it was a discount to begin with He was a few hours late I would probably use them again but I would stay with them to make sure they keep moving because when he was here I was at work and my husband was just letting him do his thing out there and I could see when I came home that for what time he got here he really had not got much done
2,I ordered a deal off Angies List and was contacted to set up a date to come to do the carpentry work The appt was for 7516 between 10 and 12 noon No one showed I contacted the scheduler and the office several times and was not able to get any information about the install I called AL and cancelled the deal and was refunded since it was within 30day window Someone did contact me after 130 pm but it was too late That is not acceptable to me I arranged my day off to accommodate them they should at least have the ability or the decency to update the customer UPDATE 1202017 The service providers response is inaccurate I was home all day and contacted them twice and left messages I received a voicemail the following day but had already canceled the deal and received a credit before the call
5,I liked that they were prompt and they did good work They knew exactly what they were doing and did a very nice job
5,Went well Prepared and painted entry doors case molds and baseboards in master bath guest bath and laundry room Cleaned scrubbed and power washed all of the garage floor Replaced and painted 14 deck boards Replaced 2 mesh kitchen window screens Previously had side garage door replaced and painted inside and out Also had deck and front steps power washed House is 17 years old and looks brand new inside and out
5,Mark the handyman who showed up to perform the work did a great job In our area there is a layer of shale under a few inches of dirt It was not a easy job but Mark did it He made sure the post was straight and was responsive to all of our concerns I would certainly use this company again
5,It went very very well We are extremely pleased with the work that was mostly done by Jim He did an outstanding job
1,I called 2 week ago to set up appointment the never returned my call what they are advertising is not true they will call and tell you that they can not do the work They said they were all booked up I have been calling for three weeks with unanswered phone calls
4,When the provider called to schedule an appointment they were booked for a month in advance I didnt realize that they would be so busy I couldnt wait that long so I decided to go with someone else They worked very hard to try and fit me in but it just didnt work out They were very sorry for the inconvenience and apologized to me They seemed very nice and understanding about the whole thing
5,The service provider was late but provided excellent service when he got here He did quality work on all of the repairs I would definitely hire them again
5,Went well They cleaned everything we had asked them to do They also cleaned and put back the accessories on top of the entertainment center
5,They were wonderful The work they did was very nice
1,I originally purchased a 99 Angies List Deal for 3 hours for drywall repair I also expressed that I needed a separate quote to put a ceiling in the basement since Im refinishing it They were supposed to come out on May 3rd but had to cancel and reschedule No big deal that was fine They werent able to schedule until May 31 That was somewhat problematic as I had a tenant moving in prior and wanted the repairs done But I thought its OK Especially because the lady who answers their phones Kim is Such a great lady super nice and accommodating That day the person comes out we go over the job and he starts telling me hed want to tear apart pretty much the whole 3rd floor for a few bad areas I expressed that that seemed overkill and he back pedaled and said that it wouldnt be everything He said it would be a day and a half but he could get started with the demolition since he thought that would take 3 hours I let him know that A I thought 3 hours seemed kind of ridiculous for tearing out a couple of smaller sections and B I wasnt comfortable having them put holes int he walls and then getting back to me later with the cost of filling the holes and me having NO idea when theyd even schedule that job or anything I told him I needed a written quote before ANY additional work could be started He tried to pressure me into letting him do the work now because they sold a lof of the coupons and they dont like to reschedule I again said he could not put holes in the walls for 3 hours when I didnt know the cost for repairs  nor the schedule He also tried to tell me the lathe work was bad and thats why some of the plaster was separating I explained and showed him the lathing was fine and again expressed it was Clearly from water damage form before the new roof you could even see discoloration from the water The owner of the company was supposed to come out later that day to give me a quote for the ceiling in the basement and I was told hed look at the job and quote it then I got a call abut 10 minutes later and was told he talked to the owner and based on his description to the owner it would take 3 days and cost 1450 He said hed like to start now I noted that we suddenly went from a day and a half to 3 days I told him he was quoting a bigger project than I had anticipated and that I wasnt going to have them start anything without an Actual WRITTEN quote Later that day I got a call from the owner He was supposed to come give me the estimates between 1 and 2 pm and I had taken the time out of the office to be there It was 156 pm he was asking if we could schedule a time for the next day for him to give me a quote I reminded him that we already had an appointment that was supposed to be right now He didnt apologize or anything and simply said So can we do it tomorrow I REALLY want to get the plaster repaired and get a quote for the ceiling so I can get it Done  so I agreed The next day he didnt show up Theres been no call no attempt to reschedule no apology or acknowledgement And he isnt answering his cell that he called me from Suffice it to say I wont be using them There were a ton of red flags  from saying the lathes were bad and had to be cut out without even looking at them to trying to turn a 3 hour 99 plaster repair into a day and half job to taking the day and a half and trying to turn it into a 3day 1450 job to wanting to demolish part of a ceiling and wall without any quote for cost or promise to return So if youre thinking about using this company  no Just no
5,I knew I was a fan of Kim when she first came to the house to give us an estimate She was personable friendly honest and driven She has since remained involved as the team assigned to our home has gotten used to the routine troubleshooting issues when they arose We had a cleaning team that serviced our home for five years and when they retired we were sure wed never find anyone as good again but its safe to say that these folks do it BETTER Our house hasnt looked this clean since we first moved in the attention to detail is extraordinary and Kim truly goes overboard to ensure that the customer is pleased with their work Ive heard of folks going the extra mile but Kim goes an extra football field to make sure things work out right The cost per visit is a little outside of our affordability range right now but Kim is working hard to find ways to get the enormous job that our house entails done in less time so that the cost comes down in the long term She does this with resourcefulness and determination and yet never compromises quality in the process I cannot recommend The House Nurses enough
3,First day 3 people came including owner Kim did kitchen and large pantry Work looked good Later on looking closely found that the top of the kitchen cabinets had not been washed Day two same 3 people came back cleaned downstairs bathroom and finished work on pantry and kitchen Day three only Kim came other two women had previous commitments and could not work Kim tried to get the livingroom room done by herself but did not get all the work done One wall needed washing over fireplace and part of another wall Things were left on mantle glass ware and etc Also other items were in left that had been moved to help her clean I had washed the curtains but they are still not up I will have to finish the room myself I decided to wash the glassware myself plus the mantle We were charged 32500 for each day of work even the final day when Kim worked alone I think the final day should have been rescheduled to a time when she could have two other workers with her The work could have been completed She gave me another appointment for May 25 about one and a half weeks after the livingroom work was begun The living room was and still is a mess When it came near their next visit I called to cancel the May 25th appointment We had been told the days fee would be 265 per day not 325 We had no written contractonly the price written on the back of their business card When the price was given for the day they had not mentioned what it would be until they finished for the day They would only take cash or personal check luckily I had enough to write a check As I said I called and canceled because we had run out of money I felt that we were being put in to their system where openings were available I must add that my husband and myself are handicapped We were told to move things away from the walls We did the best we could they were not very specific in what we needed to do I had hoped to have my home looking good by the first of June so that I could invite people into my house again It hasnt happened and I am very frustrated The work they did was OK though spotty Communication was not good And the final day should have been rescheduled so that three workers could have taken on the livingroom room and foyer
5,Did a good job on everything around the house that I need fix in the time frame
5,109 for 3 Hours of Drywall or Plaster Repair
5,I was pleasantly surprised when I came home and found the amount of progress made on the first floor I didnt expect they would get to it at all with the time allotted I asked my son on the phone how the bathroom looked and he said just like new I was in the kitchen and I was trying to figure out why the kitchen seemed so much brighter I realized the lamp covers were dusted First I was in shock over what a difference it made and second I was impressed that a detail like that was done Ive never had my house cleaned but after 5060 hours a week for the last year and half I needed some help catching up My husband was quite happy as well The bathrooms did look great They said they would show up between 930 and 1000 and arrived at just about 10am Kim called a couple days prior to reconfirm everything Completely professional company and quality service
5,Kim and Jesse came out and did 3 hours of house cleaning my house look brandnew better than ever they were very professional on time and went beyond services rendered their extremely polite and I would highly recommend them again to anybody who is looking for a house cleaning services one of my friends from Angies List referred me to them I would love to give them a page of happiness but cannot find it in this review section to do so I would highly recommend and rehire them for additional services
5,Called to let me know theyd be a bit late more than fine and they did a nice and through job cleaning for first time at my home
5,Kim came out and did 3 hours of work at my home she was very punctual very courteous and very professional my house looks spotless and shiny it smells very good and she did excellent work she was very efficient and did not stop until the work was done I would definitely use the house nurse again on a job she was referred to me by a friend and did excellent work
1,Employee late rude and not effective tore window shade
4,was kind of nervous at first because I did not receive a follow up call the day before I did call the morning scheduled and had to leave a message Handyman called about 30 minutes before He arrived on time It took him awhile to figure out one of the shelves because I had lost the instructions and it was partially installed But the work he completed I was very pleased with Did a very good job
5,Did a wonderful job was on time and cleaned up after the job was completed
5,When we finally made an appointment for reviewing our project the provider called to confirm Then when their prior appointment changed they called before coming out earlier than expected Overall I appreciated their repeated efforts to get and keep in touch I thought they were very professional and if needed willcontact them again
5,He was very professional and did a great job
4,They worked out fine They came out and did a few things around my house They did fine The person was fine The one thing that I had a problem with was that the one fixture they changed out had a light bulb that was burnt out and they had to back and change the bulb He didnt tell me the light bulb was burnt out He was a little early which was good He was very professional He was very friendly and I have a dog and he wasnt put off by the dog which is always nice He was a nice person
5,Mark arrived on time and was very professional The repairs look great The scope of the repairs exceeded the limit of the coupon We are so pleased with the work that we will be having them come agin to finish up Thanks
4,Our house door frame was not fixed
5,Kim went out of her way to schedule my cleaning for when I wanted it Kim arrived on time brought all of her supplies and got to work right away I dont think she stopped to rest at all in three hours she worked tirelessly My house has not had a thorough cleaning before so it needed cleaning and Kim made the rooms look great Kim worked around all the stuff I still had on my kitchen counter with no hesitation Kim asked when she had questions and was very cognizant of making sure I was happy with her work She made sure she completed what she could and did not try to run out of here when the three hours was up I would have no second thoughts about hiring her again She was polite and professional and I am extremely pleased with the experience I had
3,I paid them 160 for 2 hours of additional labor
1,After this company never showed up for the scheduled appointment a few years ago I thought I would give them another try since they continue to get decent reviews Called and made an appointment a few weeks ago and I got stood up for the second time unbelievable Called the number I was given when I made the initial appointment after no one showed up and left a message and no call back
5,I hired House Nurses to provide a good cleaning to my elderly parents 2 BR 25 bath condo I couldnt have been happier with the outcome Kim arrived on time and dug right in Over the course of three hours she did a very thorough job in the kitchen and bathrooms which are the areas where I asked her to focus She brought her own tools and equipment to do the job I was very impressed She did much more than just normal surface cleaning She got into the corners nooks and crannies  on her hands and knees when necessary Since she gave the kitchen and bathrooms such a good cleaning hopefully it wont be so tough next time After the kitchen and bathrooms were done there wasnt much time to do a couple of the other rooms but Kim stayed a little longer and dusted and vacuumed all around  which my mom really appreciated I would hire House Nurses again in a heartbeat My parents plan to use her for regularly monthly cleaning since its getting too hard for my parents to do it themselves Kim is a hard worker  no breaks no messing around  while still being polite and professional
5,I purchased the 3 hours of deep house cleaning special I was at work so I left a detailed note on what I wanted done Everything was cleaned above and beyond living room dining room kitchen stairwell bathroom I am very happy with the service
5,I couldnt be happier with the job from the consult to the finished product All the people involved were extremely helpful courteous and professional I told Mike what I kind of wanted done and he knew exactly what I didnt know how to ask for and his staff executed it perfectly Not once did I have to question or correct what they were doing I would and in fact am already planning on having them back for some more work at my house
4,Went ok but needs to come back to sand and paint very difficult getting scheduled
5,Kim was very prompt and very friendly I told her what I had needed done and explained that I have not been in my house for 6 months I had rented it out The full bath was pretty dirty with makeup hair etc ground in to the floor The bathtubshower looked like it hadnt been cleaned in months Kim did a great job getting 99 of the floor clean which is EXTREMELY impressive it was in BAD shape She did a good job on the rest of the bathroom as well She even went so far as removing a window valance that wasnt mine which was filthy Kim asked me if I wanted her to take it downstairs to the laundry I told her it wasnt mine and she could just throw it out After finishing the bathroom she came downstairs and asked me what else I wanted done because I still had time left that I paid for She cleaned the half bath as well and wiped out the inside of my refrigerator I also want to mention that while Kim was upstairs I cleaned out my refrigerator of all the leftover food containers left from my renters I filled up 90 of a large garbage bag that was still sitting in my kitchen when Kim asked if I wanted my refrigerator wiped out When she was through she asked me if I wanted her to take out that garbage bag I told her I could get it and she said thats what Im here for She promptly tied the bag shut and took it outside to my garbage canIMPRESSIVE Kim did a GREAT job and again was very personable THANKS KIM
5,Replaced an ENTIRE halfbath ceiling democleanadd studsdrywallthree muds in 4 hours Agreed to comp him for the 4th hour he cleaned up and youd never know he was there I only had minor mud on the walls to sand down and use touch up paint
5,I purchased an Angies Deal for two hours of handyman labor and am delighted to report that my experience was completely positive The gentleman arrived on time completed the tasks and cleaned up afterwards He was professional and polite  I couldnt have asked for more I will definitely contact The House Doctors for future tasks
1,Angies List should have a new category for contractors that do not followup with homeowners This seems to be the rule rather than the exception with contractors listed here This contractor was quick to return my call sort of quick to come to our house and review the work to be performed and quick to promise us a write up for an estimate Unfortunately that was the end of it No followup no estimate not a call not a return call Do not support this contractor Interesting I actually contacted the contractor and advised that we found the location of the leak I requested that they go to next phase and advise as to what could be done and to provide a cost estimate I have checked the voice mail logs and caller ID logs No return call was ever made
5,She was prompt and thorough I would use her again
5,Such a deal They were ontime cleaned up but did not do finish work Just so you know what to expect
5,First time using a house cleaning Kim was great She offered suggestions and helped do some organizing on top of just cleaning House has never looked better I look forward to her next visit
5,They did a fantastic job It was far far beyond my expectations in fact Everything was picked up dusted and wiped down throughly vacuumed corners and crevices were taken care of window sills cleaned and more Im really happy with the job and would gladly call on them again
5,The work went very well The installer was on time and did a professional job with the installation
5,Kim did an excellent job in both bathrooms I especially like that she took down the blinds and washed them in the bathtub along with removing grit along the shower tracts I was very pleased with the job she did on both rooms Thank you I will definitely call again in the future
3,good job
5,Easy to arrange schedule Got a call in the morning from the contractor  uh oh worried about the inevitable upsell But that wasnt the case  he wanted to explain that the baseboard was quite a bit wider than the one I had supplied and the vertical board had some millwork in it that wouldnt look completely like the regular board I had supplied He could and did do the work with the materials supplied he just wanted to let me know there would still be hidden parts of the baseboard that were probably decayed behind the new wood and that the vertical piece would look a little different than what came down No ask for an upsell he just wanted me to know Very professional When I got home the work looked great I like these guys
5,From the person who schedues the appointmets Kim to the person who did the work I could not have asked for more pleasant and professional people James I think that was the young mans name was on time and worked steadily from the time he arrived until he left He finished the original job I asked for in less than two hours so he was able to do the additional job of caulking I have absolutely no complaints
5,After reading the reviews and looking at the deal I chose The House Doctors for my drywall work and am very happy I did They were great Quality work professional and courteous The best part they even cleaned up at the end taking the time to run a wet cloth over my floors to clean up the dry wall dust Ive had contractors who wont even clean up the scraps and wasted material let alone any mess they make I would not hesitate to use them again
4,They were fine There was a little mixup with the scheduling dates We had to keep scheduling it The work was done a month later The workers were professional
5,professional courteous cleaned up thoroughly patched all issues I noted and found some additional issues in need of repair
5,Very good service Im probably going to hire them again this summer
5,He was right on time and he gave me a confirmation call 30 minutes before he arrived as promised He cleaned up all of the paint scrapings He was professional and very friendly
5,Purchased a Big Deal for 3 hours of deep cleaning for 99 Arrived promptly at the scheduled time Reviewed our list of priorities and quickly got to work Did not quite finish everything on the list in the allotted time but did a thorough job in the areas that were cleaned Would certainly consider using this service again
5,Service was great Scheduler was very pleasant and accommodating Service visit was on time as scheduled The gentleman that came to do the work was pleasant knowledgable and thorough He finished some molding on the main staircase and built out shelving in a kitchen pantry His work was done well and he cleaned up after all was finished
4,This was a big deal purchase It was alright They were not able to do what I really needed
5,He did a very nice job replacing what he could in the 4 hours of time I purchased through an Angies List Big Deal He showed me what problems were created by the need for a new roof  water damage that I did not realize could be a result of the old roofHe was pleasant helpful and professional
5,When Mike tore out the damaged floor of the corner cabinet under the kitchen sink he found that the builder Shore West had left an open hole under the floor of the cabinet instead of properly ducting it to the register thereby allowing moisture to accumulate under the cabinet That is what caused the floor to collapse He explained how he could fix it properly and offered us the option After agreeing to everything he explained very well he went to Home Depot and picked up alternative flooring that would allow for a more finished product and all the other necessary supplies to fix the heating ventilation and plumbing problems under our sink He spent an additional 2 hours and fixed everything perfectly He cleaned everything up beautifully and was very personable It looks amazing and we are so happy we went with his professional expertise and had it done right He was not pushy at all like many other repairmen we encounter and was very trustworthy
3,It did not turn out well The deal just didnt go as I purchased I purchased for 99 3 hours of carpentry First of all they were late but they called to say they were going to be late When they showed up they had no information at all about what they were supposed to do I had an appointment with the House Doctors to have the work done I dont claim to be smart They did work but they did not give me credit for 3 hours of any kind of work I paid almost 800 One of those gentlemen from the company was supposed to call me back If he called me back I didnt get the call I chose the House Doctors because about 8 years or so ago when they came out and they replaced a part in my yard The first time I used them they were great and I had no problem Because part of this was my fault because I was not assertive enough It was an annoying experience The owner of House Doctors should have said What happened here I paid 850 and I asked about the 99 that I paid for the Angies List deal He subtracted that 99 so I paid them 750 I said to myself its ridiculous for me to have paid them this much money when I was supposed to have gotten 3 hours of service I didnt have any problem with the work that they did especially the young men that did my porch The other thing that surprised me was that they put the stuff in a bag like the old post whatever junk was left from the repair they put them in a bag and put it beside my garage I am in my 70s and I was supposed to get it to the front but how I guess that was my business I didnt see any evidence of the material because it seemed like they cleaned up so well My daughter came by and asked what was the bag beside the garage That had to be thrown away or they should have at least asked me if I have a way of getting it away from here I think he did a good job on the porch Just the haphazardness of the way they showed up and absolutely had nothing I believe that the Angies List deal that I had purchased is because of the appointment and the time and the peoples names that were used when I made the appointment One of those guys went out to Home Depot to purchase everything that they needed I paid for everything out of my pocket I have talked about having them do 3 doors They told me the price for that would be 900 I said they were crazy I am going to purchase the door and its going to cost me somewhere in the area of 900 for them to put them in That was what one of the gentlemen was supposed to call me back and talk to me about That is not going to happen
3,I thought the price was a lot when I saw the finished product I was expecting them to do a wood restoration that would make the wood look good and the wood did not look good It does not look good I know it was sanded down and all that But it does not look good He explained that he did what he could with it They could have been more responsive to my phone calls
5,One time and did a good job
4,The guys brought out the compound and spackling What happened was when he got to my mothers house he had some spackling but not enough to do the complete job What he had on his truck was enough to do only one coat He told us that after everything dries wed need to sand it and do a second and maybe a third coat and then itll be ready for painting I would like for them to come out sand and put on the remaining coats and get it ready so that we can paint it What hes done so far is good its just incomplete My grades are provided that they come and finish the job
3,Called the day before Changed time to 9 am was 930 Said it would be 2 people only one showed I saw that the person had called at nine So when I called her back she stated Im on the way Do you have a mop Got to my house after 940 Started her timer Only washed down my cabinets in a small L shaped kitchen My cabinets did have grease on them but not 3 hours worth And she used my products and did not placed them back where she got them from
5,They came in we walked through what I wanted done prioritized the room needs and then proceeded to do exactly what I needed They were wonderful professional and very nice Everything was professionally handled and they treated the house as they would their own Thanks
5,Provider was unable to come on original date due to staff illness She agreed to do job herself the next day She arrived promptly with one helper They got started right away and worked very hard They swept and mopped cleaned tub and shower wiped down cabinets and counters stove and refrigerator
1,I used the Angies List service to purchase a coupon for 99 of drywall work sucker from The House Doctors back in January of 2015 I provided all of the information and provided 3 suggested dates for the work Here is the note I attached to the job just to give the reader an idea of the scope of the work Several wall and ceiling areas need this service including one large area in the ceiling over the landing on the stairs I will most likely purchase more time to ensure everything gets done Thanks Heres what happened The response immediately via Angies List left out the names and phone numbers etc Hi xxxxxx Please send your phone number to xxxxxxxxxxcom or call Michael xxxxx at xxxxxxxxxx to get scheduled Thanks Bob xxxxx  I emailed Bob promptly and gave him 2 phone numbers where he could attempt to reach me and I received a quick response that day that they would be in touch  With no guarantee of when they would contact me for scheduling I contacted Bob again via email 2 days later  Another immediate response this time to say I would be contacted that day or the next or that i could call Michael if I needed faster scheduling Today or tomorrow sounded perfectly fine so I waited Then I called Michael at the number provided and left a message with my name and phone number  4 weeks later I decided to send another message this time via Angies List I included photos of the work I needed done and let them know I would call Michael that day which I did and left another message  The response immediately via Angies List Hi xxxxxx We can certainly help you out with your drywall project Please send your phone number to xxxxxxxxxxcom or leave a message for Michael at xxxxxxxxxx and he will schedule your work Thanks Bob xxxxx  I responded via Angies List that the person on the other end of the email they provided Bob had my phone number for weeks already but that I would attempt to call Michael again as soon as I had time Which I did and left a message  Some time went by and I hired another business to complete the work I can only assume that they were not interested in the business of someone who had prepaid for a small amount of labor even though the job would have guaranteed them far more money The pictures I provided clearly show I needed more than 99 of labor but they didnt bother to even provide a quote I guess business was booming Needless to say I will not be hiring them for any of the many other jobs I need completed nor will I recommend them to others Not that they seem to need it
5,The gentleman came out and did everything we asked him to do with a smile We replaced the thresholds on the front and back doors they were rotted and and needed reinforcement He did everything the way it should be done and didnt cut corners A very hard worker
4,They did very well taking them down so i could paint them Then they rehung them up for me It went very well for everything
5,Wonderfully professional Very courteous Took the time to learn what was my highest priority and accommodated my preference Checked in to make sure they were meeting my needs Very efficient I would absolutely recommend these house cleaners
5,Had had House Doctors do some fence repairs earlier this year and was very pleased Bought the three hour big deal and left message Company returned call next day and set up appointment for a couple of weeks out I called back discovering that I had a repair due date to meetand responded to best meet my needs I purchased the lumber Carpenter came on time and seemed to do a very good job on fence repairs He worked the full three hours was friendly and cleaned up old materials bring them to the tree lawn for pickup I knocked him down to B on professionalism because he didnt seem to have all the tools etc with him to do fence work Overall very good experience
5,I had three areas of damage to my homes ceilings from plumbing leaks I have been trying to get someone to repair this for a long time It needed to have the taping removed for a large area in the kitchen and i was afraid the stippling would not match My home is 26 years old He did a fantastic job of repairing it and it is hardly noticeable Since the builder did not ever paint the ceiling I was able to just leave the repair as it is and dont even have to paint it It blends right in He was courteous and professional and went above and beyond to complete my work I used the Big Deal and paid a little extra for the extra time he had to spend while the plaster cured
2,My initial coupon was for 3 hours I have 2 areas on ceilings that needed repair One had the drywall already pieces in The other needed a 2x2 piece pieced They arrived late and had 2 guys One guy did virtually nothing The other did all the work which was not a lot In 15 hours the coupon was used up because they arrived with 2 people I needed a return trip because one of the areas needed to dry I get that I placed calls to schedule a return No calls back Very poor customer service
5,I gave a B for quality not because of the work but because i had to buy a 2nd coupon to finish the job
5,The provider was prompt courteous and professional She had all of her own tools and cleaning products The provider explained what she was going to do and she did it The rooms smell fresh and clean The kitchen floor has never been cleaner While not perfect the provider put in two hours of work on the rooms and her efforts show
5,Ordered the Angies List Big Deal for 79 Emailed company Kim emailed and called within 48 hours to set appt Kim came on time Cleaned as indicated Very polite and professional
1,After a week I still hadnt received an estimate so I called and left a message informing him that I had not received an estimate I again gave my phone number and email address thinking maybe he lost it After not hearing anything after my call for another 3 days I left another message asking for the estimate The next day I received a call from a woman at the business stating that the owner was out of town for a couple days and that I could expect to hear something on Monday Well it is now Thursday and have still not been contacted Not a very responsive business Company states in their response that they emailed an estimate twice This is completely untrue After I originally did not hear from them I left a voice mail message stating my email address AGAIN I never received ANY email In addition their was never any attempt to call me after they said they would Their response appears to be a canned response similar to another poor rating on October 8 2015 I just updated my rating to an F for professionalism as well due to unethical response
5,They came out and they were very good We had our ceiling fans up and we took them down
5,The first time I called them it was late September 2015 I called on a weekend to leave a message Bob Vecchio returned my call in less than 5 minutes He said not to worry and plenty of time left to repair porch before it gets too cold to paint His son Mike met with me on October 8 to give me an estimate for the work He was extremely knowledgeable and helpful He explained in detail what they would do The estimate arrived about two days later via email The price seemed very fair Work started on October 26 Jim came on time and worked very efficiently It was clear to me that he was quite comfortable with porches He tore open the porch to check what was going on underneath Mike came out to inspect too and he advised me on the additional work needed to reinforce the joists He had told me ahead of time that there would be additional costs for the joists but it would not be thousands of dollars It turned out to be about 800 which I understood Jim worked alone and finished the entire job in two days Pretty amazing given he had to reinforce ALL of the joists correct what the previous contractors had done and replaced 80 of the tongue and groove boards Mike came out two times to follow up and to make sure I was happy Im a graphic designer and Ill be honest Im very particular about work in our house being done neatly and correctly I am not exactly easy to please Jim is an excellent carpenter He is very quiet professional and neat This is the second time he has done work at our house The first experience was a side door installation and that went very well too The porch looks fantastic and it appears to be very solid The wood came primed so my husband stained it a few days later Its in tiptop shape for the winter now Thank you House Doctors
5,Showed up on time  didnt stop until job was complete
5,The old ball and chain decided to place a doorway between our living room and dining room for quiet and privacy while watching TV I hated the door because it made the house seem smaller After several years of complaining he took it down but procrastinated about rebuilding the doorway frame When I saw the deal for The House Doctor I jumped on it Mike arrived on time was very professional and did not leave a mess
2,Two young man came on time Pleasant and receptive The work was to repair bottom of door frame and loose door sill 1 He and his assistant started to cut out rotten part of the frame and part of sub floor They needed to fill the gap They cut 1x4 and painted one piece and did not paint the other piece Made 2 pieces rather than one Attached to floor joist with glue and screws They could not put back door sill because there is no sub floor They had to put screws to metal part of the door sill to anchor it It is not very stable 2 To repair bottom of door frame they cut out rotten part of the frame They put pieces of wood to replace cut out part of door frame Pieces of wood did not fit well they needed many trial and error to make it fit The finish is not even part of the replaced wood is sticking out 3 They cracked inside of door frame while doing the work for which they put caulk and a screw to avoid separation 4 They did not buy correct weather sseal for bottom of the door had to buy another one which I paid again They had to make another trip to the Home depot which took another 25 minutes First trip to Home depot was to buy 1x4 wood and weather seal Next day I had to remove and make it fit because metal part was deforming weather strip 5 While removing the door to replace weather strip they made 2 ugly gouges to inside door frame 6 They did not have tarp to protect my newly installed wood floor The men worked as much as they know how to do it I do not blame them I have problem with The house doctor They should have sent skilled person to do the job They sent inexperienced workers Due to the trial and error it took much longer to do the job and caused some damages to the door frame It took total 85 man hour and I had to pay 195 extra The Angies list coupon was 111 for 3 hour I have hired a lot of contractors from Angies list This is first time I am reporting because Angies list members should know about the company
5,The problem we hadno hot wateris gone and we are very pleased
5,Nice job  very polite  would use again
4,It went fairly well however it cost me more money One of the helpers was not as professional I would use them again but request a different person to help
4,This was an Angies List deal and scheduling with this provider was difficult When the person would call and leave a message for me to call her to schedule I would quickly return her call and had to call and leave a message more than once just to get someone to call To be honest after all the attempts I cant remember the exact date when I was finally able to get the work done When the two young men came out they were punctual and professional And the work was satisfactory I had to pay extra to get the drywall in the condition it really needed to be And for them to sand and paint would have cost 5065 more That did not seem like a good deal to me The area was not that large Im not sure I would use them in the future but if I did it will not be with an Angies Special I would instead get a quote for the entire job first Also the date that I have entered may not be the correct date the work was done so i apologize to the vendor I do not have access to my files right now to retrieve the invoice and I had to enter a date in order to complete the review
4,I think it was 99 for four hours They did good work but I had to figure out a way to get it painted They did good work but they did not finish it I dont have a ladder tall enough so I think although they were actually doing work it kind of caused me to do more work I would have been nice if they had offered a solution to have it finished They were there longer than the deal was for which was fine but I felt like that pricing was a little bit high The quality of work seemed good but they just didnt finish or offer a way to finish it
1,Before making the purchase of the Big Deal for plaster repair I sent a message to the company through Angies List briefly explaining the type and size of the repair in the ceiling plaster I also said the property was in Lakewood and I asked if they were registered to work in Lakewood I received a message back that they could help me with the repair and they could work in Lakewood Based upon this information I purchased the Big Deal I got a call from someone at the company wanting to set up a date for the repair This is a rental property and I had to clear the work with the tenant When that was set I called the company back to set up the date After a week I got a call back and the time was set for July 14 with their worker to arrive between 1000  1130 am On the day of the appointment I was at the property at 10 am and waited At 1130 exactly the worker showed up We went to the room and he looked at the area and said it could not be repaired and the entire ceiling would have to be replaced at a cost of approximately 1000 I said that was not an option and we left But I was not surprised by this situation because I felt that this company was very unprofessional from the beginning First of all it was obvious that they never read my messages about the problem because they kept asking me for my phone number which I provided in the messages Secondly they never asked for any detailed information about the problem photos or anything Because they dont go to the site to evaluate the problem I believe they are really unprepared to take care of anything except small issues I also want to note that this company is not on the Lakewood Building Departments list of registered contractors as I was lead to believe by the company Strangely enough the day after the appointment I had a call from a lady at The House Doctors checking to see if an appointment had ever been made to come to my property I laughed and said yes yesterday was the appointment She apologized for not knowing but indicated she was trying to get them organized or something to that effect I said someone had been to the property but I did not have the work done I would strongly recommend that members be wary of this company and if you contract for them to do any work make sure they are able to do it before you do anything with them And since then I have talked to other plaster contractors and they all indicated the ceiling could be repaired I have since had the repair made for much less than 1000
5,The job was done professionally in a timely manner and they were happy to work around scheduling constraints Mark communicated with me throughout the job with updates and timelines and they were able to finish this large job quickly I would definitely hire them again
1,I tried reaching the contractor four time He never returned any of my calls I tried over a period of two weeks Very unprofessional
3,It was okay First of all it said 99 for three hours of work However they dont tell you that they would bring two people out and that its split So basically it was an hour and a half for 99 with two guys and it also includes them going to get the material So that took us 45 minutes So basically we paid 99 for 45 minutes It took them in addition three hours to complete the project So I dont think I would use them again It was cheaper than if you got a carpenter to do it But another thing halfway through it he was committed to another project So he had to leave I said Wait a minute Youve got half of it done When can you come back He said Oh I dont know Youll have to speak to my boss and draw up a schedule I said No Thats not right Youre half done here You dont leave this job to go to another job which he did But I begged him and he came back Saturday and finished it up But he was rushing through it So he didnt do it the way he should have done it So most likely I wont use them again The price was pretty decent It was 400 to rebuild a wall But the whole thing was just not handled properly I think saying 99 for three hours of work you should put in there that theyre bringing two people and then that split up and then also that you have to pay to go get the materials What I had to do was drive with them and go pay for the materials That took us 45 minutes So basically were paying 99 for 45 minutes work which was nothing more than tearing the old stuff off The work was decent He is just a handyman but he really tried his best I think these guys are under the gun and they overbook them Thats what he said to me He said When they put out these specials were running around mad He said I feel bad I was rushing to get it done under the time I didnt do it how I wanted to do it So he even mentioned that he was stressed out Another thing was they dont take any of the trash I had four or five bags of stuff that I had to carry out myself to the trash the following Tuesday So they dont take any of that with them either The guy was pretty decent and mannerly I watched him the whole time He wasnt snarky about that
5,I provided a plywood sheet and the screws They cut the plywood and installed it were I wanted They were on time and professional Overall a good transaction
3,I spoke with someone at the shop ahead of time to make sure they clearly understood what the job was and whether they would need any additional supplies etc I told her I had this same thing done in a different room of the house that was approximately the same size and it took 2 guys  nonprofessionals  only about 2 or 3 hours to complete the entire project The woman was very pleasant and said they had all the info and supplies they needed and just wanted to confirm the time The day of the scheduled appointment one carpenter showed up It became obvious within a matter of seconds that he was told nothing about the job and had no idea what he was hired to do After I explained what I wanted done  vinyl plank flooring installed in one smallish room  the first words out of his mouth were I hate installing these things The second thing out of his mouth was There is no way I can finish this in one day This is going to take at least 2 days to complete it I was not off to a good start Long story short he did wind up completing the job in one day It took about 7 hours so it wasnt cheap And after the rocky start the carpenter did loosen up and was very nice He also worked very hard to get the project completely in one day As far as the results he did a very nice job fitting the planks together evenly and correctly and at a glance the flooring looks very nice However he did a very shoddy job around the corners and edges of all doorways stairs and fireplace He did not remove the bottom trim of the baseboards in order to slide the planks underneath them resting 516th of an inch from the wall like you are supposed to I also made sure the representative I spoke with on the phone understood this and she said it would be no problem So after this I had to hire a separate carpenter to come and replace all the baseboards and trim because the uneven and jagged edges of the flooring butting up against the wall looked awful And since then Ive still been using brown calking paint and pieces of floor transitions in attempt to hide all the mistakes and gaping holes around the fireplace and entryway Bottom line is you get what you pay for I found the best ie cheapest deal on Angies List and the job was completed in one day I wasnt expecting a miracle worker nor did I get one Next time tough Ill gladly pay an extra couple hundred bucks to do a better job I still cant get over the fact that I had 2 nonprofessional guys install the same flooring in another room that was approximately the same size and they finished it in 23 hours and it looks immaculate yet it took this service an entire working day to simply finish it and the quality wasnt even half as good Oh well You get what you pay for
4,When the representative called me to set up the service I realized that I hadnt understood the details of the deal and it was not going to work for us  timing and the need to purchase our own materials made it not as appealing to us I received a refund from Angies List The House Doctors were courteous and helpful as I realized this wasnt going to work for us at this time
3,I called them and the problem was not rectified They said someone would come out and no one did
5,Great job The house is old and the front porch needed repairs Several pieces has rotted cracked and broke off The new wood was cut evenly and placed in sturdy interlocking pieces I was amazed that as much of the porch was able to be repaired within the time frame of 3 hours I will definitely have more work done on the porch The carpenter was professional polite and did a great job Thank you House DoctorsI highly recommend you
5,Mark was prompt very polite and cleaned up after the job
1,I called the company and left a message A woman called back the next day and set up an appointment for the following week on Friday 9112015 between 100 and 300 I stayed home Friday afternoon waiting for the person to come At 500 I called the company and left a message that no one showed up for the appointment This is Monday afternoon and still no contact I wasted half a day waiting for the contractor to show up
3,Not as expected
5,The painters came for parts of several days and worked steadily even on some hot days At the last minute my husband asked them to do another window and the trim on the corner which he thought we had requested earlier They had to come back another day to finish up The men were very professional and polite and friendly It is nice to have all of these jobs done
5,On time within a set 2 hour window Did the job Will need to come back to complete the ceiling repairs though The mud needed additional time to dry before it was ready to retexture I will hire again
3,hired to power wash home they contact you via email and give you a telephone number to call to make appointment the number is completely unmanned and getting in contact with them was extremely difficult and when I did they notified me they were booking months out
5,Mark was amazing He was so conscientious and professional I thought for sure he was the owner he is not When the job was completed quickly he offered to paint the area he repaired So grateful otherwise I am sure the wall would not have been painted for weeks Scheduling was a pain but now I know it was so worth it Kim the scheduler was a delight
5,They responded to my appointment request promptly showed up on time and completed the work in an efficient and professional manner I would hire them again to perform other work at my home
4,I bought the 3 hrs of service thru Angies List but didnt need 3 hrs of workjust wanted to get the job done ASAP The contractor was prompt personable and worked efficiently I had removed water damaged baseboards drywall and wallpaper well away from the repair area but the repair guy extended the drywall mud onto areas that still had wallpapermaking it difficult for me to sand and prep the whole section for new wallpaper He cut new baseboards using the previous baseboard pieces to match but they were more than 14 off when I went to reinstall them So I took the original pieces to a lumberyard and had new pieces cut to the same angles Guess what The lumberyard also cut them incorrectly I finally trimmed them myself with a miter box and undercut by 18  and filled the gap wcaulk Contractor did a nice job caulking shower stall  clean and professional looking and very quick Overall responsive service and a good price but medium quality Like many handymen they know what theyre doing but you still need to direct and inspect so you dont end up with additional tasks
4,Dont remember details its been 2years since service
5,I bought a 100 coupon for 3 hours of drywall work from 1 Drywaller Instead of 1 guy 2 showed up and completed the work in a little over an hour Initially I was charged a full hour for the work going about 10 minutes past the hour I notified the Secretary that although I paid I didnt think I should be charged the full amount of 85 extra The company owner learned of this and was good enough to return my 85 which I think is very professional The work and price were great No complaints Would recommend Tom
5,On time Professional courteous I would use again and highly recommend
1,Purchased Certificate online and could not get a hold of company for over four weeks Called Angieslist and they cancelled the purchase approximate cost of service 9900
5,They did an excellent job and even did the stucco I would use them again
4,They did a great job of quickly repairing the damage They put down drop clothes and swept up the area pretty well I think they did a great job However it took the company a week or more to get back with me to schedule an appointment
5,Mike came this morning and I showed him what work needed to be done He got right to work and was very skilled I am very impressed with the work he did Its not even noticeable that there was a huge hole in my wall I have used The House Doctors before and will definitely use them again
5,Responded on time and came with an assistant Appointment delayed a halfhour and kept Worked hard and completed by afternoon Repaired and replaced several posts and a number of pickets Worked hard to keep my materials cost down and cleaned up well Highly recommend
5,Job was partially completed as Deal was for three hours and tech was at end of day Very neat thorough and informative tech Waiting for an estimate to complete repairs
1,The worker showed up my wife explained that we wanted the walls in the garage repaired he said that the cracks would likely return despite his work Thats all fine but he ignored most of the walls and was not here for anywhere close to three hours The parts he did were fair at best This deal was a total waste
5,Excellent work timely cleaned up courteous very professional
5,I needed to call as the prior scheduler failed to followthrough When I explained the situation the new scheduler was very responsive and the technician who performed the work was diligent I would use them again
4,Went wellit was a deal from angies listmy only complaint was that I took the deal on May 5th but the earliest they could complete the service was June 25th or so Long time to wait for service to be preformed
1,I shopped a coupon from Angies list for 99 for three hours of general carpentry work I thought that it would be good enough to put on a single wood panel on the exterior wall and repair a small area of deck I waited one week before a lady called me to schedule a time She told me that I had to get all the materials ready myself After two more weeks a guy showed up with a compact car He apparently did not even have a ladder to do the work Instead he tried to give you a lot of reasons that much more work would be needed and came up with a cost estimate in the amount of 2000 This is a scam I would never recommend to buy any coupon from this company
3,I had great difficulty scheduling as House Doctors did not respond to my repeated phone calls or emails IJob was originally scheduled for June 11 and after waiting for hours it was finally cancelled due to earlier job taking too long Rescheduling was again very difficult I would have cancelled but it was now past 30 days so I contacted Angies List for help After my call to An gies List I heard back from House Doctors quickly and scheduled job for several weeks lateras there were only 2 dates available Job itself was done well quickly and efficiently
2,There was no initial contact for months because they were very hard to reach After several phone calls and emails someone finally called back and said they could not give me a service date because they had so many customers respond to the deal So I patiently waited several months for them to contact me which they never did so I contacted them again I finally reached the owner who said he was going on vacation and to talk to his son I reached the son who gave me another number to call to talk to another guy At that point I no longer had any interest in their services because I felt they were totally unorganized and overbooked
1,They didnt provide any services I got a refund from Angies List After I bought the deal I spoke with people over and they said that they would come the first day to make an estimate and let us know what would be involved in the project and then they would come back and add in the hours that we had purchased plus any additional time plus materials That sounded all very good Then when they came over seven weeks later because that was the first time that they were available to come over the guy came with an assignment to do the job and asked me if I had all of the materials I didnt know what the job entailed and I didnt know what materials were needed He then told me that the time that he was there right then was part of the time that we had purchased I said that there had been some kind of mistake Then I spoke with his manager and we decided that it would be in both of our best interest just to cancel the deal Thats what we did There was no way that I was going to be able to trust them to do the work after there was such a misunderstanding I made that very clear to them that I did not want them to do the work if this is how they were going to work with me He claimed that it was a misunderstanding and I still didnt want them Now Im sitting here with the work still needing to be done and I need to find someone to do it
3,The service person arrived on time but seemed surprised that my cracks could not easily filled with spackling compound but needed to be taped and covered with drywall compound The first 30 minutes was wasted on him lecturing on what he could do and not do Finally I asked him to do the best he could when repairing the cracks My reason for having him repair the cracks was to see if that would solve my problem or if they would just reappear I also was being lazy as I could have done it but thought it would be easier to have someone else do it Once he started he did an okay job that the cracks will need to be sanded and another coat of dry wall compound will be required I had hope that is first coat have been smoother then what I could have done so extra sanding would be minimum He also did not tape all of the crack so those cracks reappeared Lastly I thought he over charged me for the additional supplies he used but I thought it would be useless to argue with him
5,Would use again Very courteous
5,Excellent Michael was the most professional worker that I have ever experienced He was so polite and did an A plus job on my drivewayHe asked to use my bathroom and as you can imagine his feet were wet I saw him clean up my bathroom floor The driveway and sidewalks look great I will definitely use The House Soctors again
1,The company gave me estimates for replacement of areas but doesnt repair lathe and plaster ceilings How can I get a refund of 19800
2,I wouldnt bother trying to work with them if you value your own time
1,I paid for the Deal 3hours of plaster work for 99 on June 23 2015 order 2082155 I selected a day June 24 2015 for service and mentioned I am available almost any day No one came on June 24 House Doctors asked for my phone number on June 23 2015 and I sent the information on June 24 I wasnt able to contact House Doctors During the period from June 23 2015 through September 3 2015 I contacted Angies List about this problem at least four times Finally after 2 months an appointment to do the work was made for August 26 2015 1012AM Two workers came to my house Mark and a assistant They said they didnt have time to do the job They did tell me that the dry wall job would cost an additional 475 To paint the interior of my house they said the cost would be 2300 and I would have to pay for the paint Mark said they would clear this price with their boss and email me a contract They left no drywall work completed After contacting Angies list again I did hear from the House Doctors secretary on September 2 2015 She asked me to repeat most of the details of my dealing with House Doctors I repeated most of the details stated above No appointment was made to do the work On September 3 2015 I contacted Angies List to ask for a refund and cancel my Deal with House Doctors Jon was very helpful and also renewed my membership My ratings above reflect my true feelings about this Deal This Company might do good work After waiting more than 60 days nothing has been accomplished at my house Without Angies list I would have had no contact with this Company
1,I bought 3 hours of drywallplaster repair about 3 weeks ago I have called  emailed repeatedly I got one email response asking for my contact info which I had provided multiple times Im working on getting a refund I would not use these people Very poor customer service
5,The crew removed all of the 45 year old broken and crumbling concrete in a very quick fashion and cleaned up the debris very nicely Next the crew replace the entire garage floor the big patio and the entrance foyer and customstamped the foyer and patio to look like natural stone surfaces After the garage patio and foyer cured the crew quickly did the entire driveway and within a few days we were able to use all of the new surfaces with no problems After the concrete cured the crew returned and sealed all of the new surfaces to ensure long life and good looks Very good experience
4,They did a good job at power washing Only complaint I have is they dont call you back I left 4 messages with in 5 days and never got a call Disappointed in the time frame for them to come out as well as they didnt call for a week once I bought the coupon I wish they would at least call people back Otherwise the deck looked good
5,Showed up with two guys One was an expert one was younger They worked well together They got all of the things done I needed I will have them back to do more work
1,they charged me and never did the work ignoring my calls BUYERS BEWARE
5,Showed up on time Surveyed the job Went out and obtained supplies and promptly returned and completed the job
5,Good communication and really nice people
1,HE never came His office said that he was very busy
5,went very well very professional carpenter was professional and hard working also provided information on another job
4,The job itself went great and they did a few other things They were clean professional and did a wonderful job They told me that the texture wouldnt be the same as the rest of the ceiling The ceiling dried and it was flat with little texture A few months later someone else came to look at it and remarked that it wasnt a great job and that they should make it better I called them back to say it needed to be retextured Mike the owner said theyd schedule someone for Memorial Day  I called them back and asked them if they wanted to schedule on a holiday They didnt so they had to reschedule They never called me back  I called them again they didnt call me back I tried calling the owner and he said he would schedule it himself I never heard from them since I was going to use them for a number of projects and they havent been very responsive However if they would like to respond to this issue I would love for them to complete the work
4,It went well the only reason I had this service provided was two fold one he was offering a special for xx hours of work and second I was recoving from surgery from cancer I am a handy man around the house and have all the toolsits just hard to reach up when you have 70 stiches
5,Had hole  crumbling ceiling between 1st and 2nd level Eric came in cut out the hole examined it and identify where the leak was coming from toilet on 2nd floor I had already fixed it He talked me through everything that had happened what to expect and what he would do He then repaired the hole added additional security to the ceiling where it was loose and added texture that looked identical to the rest of the kitchen He did an amazing job got it done in less than 3 hours and went above and beyond to educate me and talk through things Because of his excellent work I will call these guys again for future jobs Thank you Eric
5,Jim arrived within the allotted timeframe He was pleasantprofessional  from starttofinish was 3 hours  15 minutes He stated the front door trim wasnt rotted but the crumbling side door threshold was obviously in need of replacement Jim took a loose paintchip from the side door trim to the nearby Sherwin Williams to match wish hed had done the same from the front door  side doors threshold which need painting  also to Home Depot for a 2x8x8  a 2x4x8 pressure treated wood caulk  other supplies Jim declined my offer to assist Pros He removed the side door stormscreen rotted threshold  small portions of the door jamb He fashioned new door jamb pieces  the threshold from the 2x8 caulked everything  reinstalled the stormscreen He caulked the bottoms of the front door trim  looks like he applied a light coat of wood filler to the driedcracked trim though I had to buy more wood filler to complete the prepainting prep The 2x4x8 was used to replace rottedhorizontal spacers  then reattach 2 fence slats He also reattached 2 other fence slats He used screws I offeredsupplied He cleanedup most of the debris He verbally said the materials cost 5500 which I paid him in cash Cons Seems the side doors threshold is lower than the original as the stormscreen door doesnt seal at the bottom when closed  which I didnt discover until after he left I completed cleaningswept his workarea of sawdust from the driveway I had asked for the SherwinWilliams  Home Depot receipts for my records  though replied No when he asked if I wanted change from the 5500 after he left I realized he bought screws for the job The receipts totaled 4789  he didnt leave the screws he bought for the job Bottom line is Im happy the thresholds been replaced so commenting above just for the recordreview
1,Very unprofessional not to even call
5,It went well  Mark called to notify us that he was on the way When he got here  he took care to lay down plastic to protect the floors from the plaster He spent a good deal of time working the mud to get it just right  and we are very excited to finally have that area finished and ready for paint Very professional and courteous  great job Mark The only reason I gave a B on responsiveness was because when the service was scheduled the service rep did not explain to me that I should have joint compound here for Mark to use  would have been good to know in advance of the work Otherwise  very pleased with the service
3,They got about half the taping competed that I would have expected to be done
5,repaired a problem i was having on my roof which was causing damage to a ceiling took out and replaced part of the ceiling
1,I called last week and still no return call
1,I have called them 7 times with no response back I will never do business again
5,Thats what he did and it was a big deal purchase
1,They are very difficult to get hold of
5,They did a real nice job in our kitchen Painted cleaned and its really nice
3,They missed the first appointment by an hour and called to reschedule When they came it was two fellows for 1 12 hours as opposed to a workman for 3 hours as the Big Deal said The work I needed done did not require 2 men The work they did cracked badly by the next day I was told by the next contractor I hired to repair it that the mud was put on too thickly I will NOT call them again
2,They dont have any openings until July I wanted the service done sooner then that
5,It turned out well He did good work and cleanedup after themselves well Theyre very versatile company that offers several different services Ive used them for several different things Theyve always done good work
5,The jobs went very well They replaced 4 window sills and a 3 sided bay window sill that had rotted They also took out the bottom six or more inches of the boards going up the side of the window sill The first day they only did the bottom of the sills and when I took pictures and asked why the sides where not replaced as discussed during the initial walk through they just hadnt gotten to that part of job It was nice that they didnt try to back track from the walk through explanation of what was included in the quote or that they didnt get defensive with my questions Just gave a quick explanation and we all moved forward The sills were all caulked into placed I am very happy with the finished product The rottedbroken wood siding they replaced looks great as well Very happy The floor joist in the basement is also very secure now during the walkthrough it was explained that they would try to sister a board from beam to beam Due to the all the extra clutter in the basement it is 145 year old house there was no way to effectively secure the new sister to the beam without removing wiringother boardsductworkplumbing They put a 6 foot board on each side of the broken joist and secured to one beam and the joist The repair looks very secure and I am happy with the work Once again I called with questions because at fist the end result did not look like what I was expecting and got a quick response and reasoning No complaints and I am happy So overall a very good experience and I would use them again The B for responsiveness is because sometimes they can be a little slow to respond to phone calls at the beginning But they are a busy company and produce at a high level so I feel like a made a good decision to stay with them and this review should help with new customers who might get a little impatient to know the wait can be worth it At the end Mike was very responsive so I think it was probably more of a seasonal issue than anything else and like I said I would definitely use them again
5,Service person arrived promptly and was shown items to be completed He installed door and door knob using the the items I had previously purchased He repaired the bifold door and removed the pantry door shaved the bottom so it no longer sticks and reinstalled the door He cleaned up after himself and left
3,The guy was quick friendly and did a decent job filling in the holes  cracks But he left little globs of drywall mud all over my newly refinished wood floors I really wish hed have cleaned up better after he was done Now I have to go around trying to remove those spots without damaging my floors Pretty bummed out about it
1,They are very hard to deal with Not customer friendly
5,Couldnt be happier great service cleaned up when done and did an overall excellent job
5,He did a good job He was very friendly and helpful
5,All of the work was very professionally completed Clean up was also great
5,We had used The House Doctors previously to rebuild my hot water heater chimney when it was almost ready to fall through our porch roof they did a great job At the time they also quoted us for putting a tub surround At the time we didnt have the money so we put it off for a year One year later we decided to completely renovate the bathroom down to the studs We called The House Doctors and they promptly came out to give us an estimate I would recommend calling them about two months before you want the service done  their schedule fills up quite quickly We were quoted a price and given a timeline of one to 15 weeks to completion Mark came out and completely demolished the entire bathroom noisy but effective Then they came and hung new drywall The rest of the project was ready to proceed We had four workers out throughout the project Project Manager Mike his son Mike Jr his nephew Mark and his daughter Steve All of them were polite dealt well with my overly friendly labcollie mix they are dog people The only part of the project we questioned was their ability to start on time Personally we would have liked to have seen them start even earlier I work from home and am up at 520 am each morning Im not suggesting 6 am but 8 am would have been OK but we all agreed on 1030 am start time For the most part they showed up around 11 am and were usually done by 430 pm While they were here they worked like dogs but we feel if theyd started even an hour earlier in the morning the project could have been done by the estimated time they finished the job in approximately two weeks In the grand scheme of things this is a minor complaint The rest of their work was stellar Our house was built in 1927 which means it isquirky to say the least Our bathtub which we kept was two inches smaller than standard tubs now The plumbing for the sink was in a weird place But the project manager Mike is so skilled at so many things he dealt with each challenge as it came up with cheerful resignation Even better he SOLVED all the problems with little fuss or muss He is really a master at what he does and I cant recommend him highly enough For example given that this was our only bathroom they worked in such a way that we were never without a toilet At first we used the one upstairs but then Project Manager Mike had the brilliant idea of moving the old toilet downstairs the basement to replace another nonfunctioning one This was critically important to us and it helped our household of 3 keep from losing our minds PM Mike installed ceramic tile on the floor up the front of the tub did I mention our house is quirky to replace some horrible ugly tile already there and around the base of the walls We had trouble with ceramic tile a few years ago with another contractor we eventually had to go with linoleum because of the problems  which were contractor caused but PM Mikes expertise made the installation a breeze No problems here Part of the original quote was refinishing our bathtub which had been destroyed in a hydrochloric acid accident 17 years ago dont ask Unfortunately their regular tub refinisher was stuck doing hotel jobs in Columbus Owner Mike Vecchio yeah that was confusing took money off because they couldnt complete it recommended another refinisher and when the quote from that contractor came in higher than expected Owner Mike volunteered to pay the difference Our overall experience with The House Doctors was pretty amazing and we would recommend them to anyone who needs home renovations done We would definitely use them again
3,They did the work the best way they know how
5,The craftsmen were so thorough and meticulous The repair was so perfect We couldnt see where the damage had even been They worked swiftly and neatly They cleaned up the work area perfectly No dust was to be found anywhere even after they sanded the repair areas As an additional bonus they helped bring in groceries from my car That was  the cherry on top I would highly recommend them to anyone
5,Purchased a 3 hour drywall repair coupon from House Doctors on weekend and was contacted on Monday with scheduled day and time The drywall in my sons bedroom was expertly repaired so that my husband could paint it Great job and great price
3,The contractor did a fine job He actually finished all the work under the allotted three hours but since he did everything so efficiently I thought that the 99 Angies deal was money well spent He even installed a threeswitch light panel for me Update Subsequent calls to this contractor have gone unanswered despite several attempts by me to contact them I dont know if they are having some sort of a businessrelated problem but I can no longer justify giving them the A rating I had given them for their previous work
1,I have tried to contact them about 3 times leaving a voicemail each time As of today I still have not heard back from them For this reason I am requesting a refund
1,I never wanted to have my house painted When they showed up on March 3rd I believed that they were bringing me an estimate for the work I had requested They did bring a signed contract explaining that I had hired them for a painting project that also included some dining room work to replace some plasterboard The plasterboard in the dining room was the only piece of nonpainting work they did I did not want to have the interior of my house painted and that is all they came to do My daughter is blind There were two rooms where she could have put her hand against the wall but they had left the wiring completely exposed They didnt replace the protective coverings that had covered our electrical outlets which was extremely dangerous This is contrary to what I had expected from them Since the work has been done I have been told by several people who have seen my home that I had overpaid for my services and they couldnt imagine how I was so gullible I feel that I was taken advantage of
5,The gentleman Mark was very knowledgeable His work was very neat He provided information we needed to prevent further water damage
5,Arrived 1 hr 20 min late without calling to notify me Stated upon arrival that they got lost But got to work as soon as they arrived and worked hard for entire 3 hours House looked really good when finished There was an issue with the coupon to begin with No one contacted me to schedule the service as stated and when I finally called I was told the coupon had expired but they would allow it
5,Mike did as always an excellent job The House Doctors always do an excellent job They are dependable and responsive The quality of their work is always good If there ever is a problem they always fix it
4,We had scheduling issues I had to have lights put in first before the drywall could be done I called Angies List to get a refund
3,Tried to get the work done and they have contacted me once but nothing came from it Therefore Im going with someone else to do the work
3,This is the second time I used this service thru Angies and Im not sure if it was the same person but it did cost the same and their washer doesnt reach high enough to get all the way up the side of my house
4,Took out approximately 3 foot by 4 foot section of damaged plaster wall down to studs replaced with drywall I had to supply the drywall and all supplies I had to pay Lowes to deliver the dry wall because it wouldnt fit into my car This was an unexpected complication and the delivery was an unexpected expense The worker was pleasant to work with and did a good job I am satisfied with the result
2,I purchased the deal in May of 2014 and attempted to contact the provider intermittently by both email and telephone for the next month or so to no avail they rarely answered the phone and responded to emails mainly by giving me the phone number where I left voicemails that did not elicit a return call I became frustrated and also busy with other things When I attempted to get a refund later in the summer I was told by Angies List that the deadline for doing so had passed They suggested contacting the House Doctors again which I did After many attempts I finally got a return phone call and scheduled a date for the work in early November They canceled at the last minute but sent someone over the following week He was not informed that I had paid for three hours of work and had only an hour before his next appointment He put a couple of finishing nails into the bannister near the top that helped a bit but not enough to satisfy the people who bought the house so it became a sticking point in the negotiations The carpenter promised to come back to replace the door frame which was entirely exterior but never did Overall I was very disappointed with my experience
5,It went very well Mike did everything we needed done and everything works
5,All went very well We have not had any leaks
5,He arrived on time called to let me know what time he would be here Got here and got right to work worked on door first did a great job even painted the frame once repaired He then worked on the drawers Clean up and left after the 3 hours
4,It didnt go as well as Id have hoped They left in the middle of the job and came back It didnt get done as well as it couldve been done I had them do the work in the kitchen the hallway and some living room work
1,Company response This was a real bad day because we got hung up on another persons job which made us real late for this customer We are human too and we would like to extend a heartfelt apology to this customer Sincerely Bob Vecchio PS WE tried to reschedule for another day but she said no Company response HAVE TO SAY THIS THIS REPORT IS A STRAIGHT OUT LIE THIS CUSTOMER WAS SCHEDULED FOR THURSDAY SEPT18TH NOT SEPT 11TH CUSTOMER CALLED AND ASKED WHERE WE WERE AND MIKE TOILD HER THAT SHE WAS SCHEDULED FOR THE FOLLOWING THURSDAY SHE DENIED IT BUT AS A CUSTOMER SERVICE MIKE OFFERED TO SEND SOMEBODY OUT LATER THAT DAY OR TODAY SEPT 12TH AND SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW IT SHE WAS HOSTILE AND MORE THAN UNREASONABLE AND I DONT MIND SAYING IT THANKS FOR READING AND UNDERSTANDING I SWEAR ON A STACK OF BIBLES THAT WHAT I JUST WROTE IS TRUE THANK YOU BOB VECCHIO Company Response WRONG NUMBERBOONOT TRUE JUST A VERY SPITEFUL RESPONSE GLAD HES MOVING ON Company Response This is a total lie He received a type written estimate in the US Mail John Bailey  my employee  met with his wife John is in his late 20s and is a Union Mason This customer better stick to his full time job because he sure as heck isnt a comedian My God we did everything right Thanks for reading my reply a nd understanding Bob V Company Response My wife was hospitalized for over a week and thats why response was slow Hope this person Understands Company Response IF THIS REALLY HAPPENED WE APOLOGIZE TO THIS CUSTOMER IT RARELY HAPPENS THAT SOMETHING SLIPS BY US BUT WERE HUMAN TOO TO ERR IS HUMAN PLEASE SEE AND NOTE THAT WE HAVE OVER 1300 ANGIES LIST REPORTS FAR EXCEEDING OTHER COMPANIES WE STRIVE TO PUT A SMILE  ON EVERY CUSTOMERS FACES PLEASE GIVE US A TRY SINCERELY BOB V Company Response We tried to save a little time by giving this customer a verbal quote since we couldnt get out to see them just as quickly as they wantedneeded We tried but sorry that we couldnt connect we try very hard to be all things to all people and sometimes you just cant Bob V
4,They were good I had them to work in the basement office One tech showed up to do the work he showed up on time and worked the whole time I had to pay extra for a few materials
3,The workers were nice however the price was a bit high and the quality work was not what we were expecting
5,I was very impressed with the workers technical skills and Efficiency in how he completed the job We would definitely hire them again
5,Had a hiccup with the pressure washer and repair  replace the unit causing a delay I did not realize that soap was not part of the package Overall he did a nice job I was pleased with the outcome The service provider was polite and prompt
5,It turned out really good They did a nice job There were two people here doing the work They arrived on time for the appointment and scheduling was good
5,Was generally happy with the patching the larger area didnt turn out quite as smooth as I was hoping although it was a large area that had been cutout so maybe my expectations were too high Had I noticed it before they left Im sure they would have addressed it though
5,I received an email within a couple of hours of purchasing the coupon I was a little taken aback when I called the number that came in the email as it was a generic phone company message with no name or company ID provided but it was the right number and a couple of days later I got a call to set up the appointment I think it was 1 days from the day I purchased the coupon until they performed the service I am very happy with the work
2,We bought an Angies list deal for 3 hours of wall repair for 90 with the intent of having the contractor repair some cracks in our plaster exposed after wallpaper removal I left three messages for the company twice with a contact that wasnt the right person to talk to After two weeks I finally heard back from the appropriate individual and they could not schedule anything until the middle of May 25 months out This was completely unacceptable to us This is not about the contractor We requested a refund and Angies list staff told us that they were going to try to find an alternate contractor to complete the work This process took months and we finally just asked forand were granteda refund These big deals should only be offered by highly rated contractors with available to do the work in short order after the deal has been purchased This was a terrible experience all around
1,They were horrible he gave me a quote and did an average job Then when he gave me the bill it was about 80000 more than he had quoted
4,The service was ok They had very good scheduling and availability
3,It was fine though there seemed to be lots of glue involved for a carpentry project Cabinet has held well though It took several days for him to call me back
5,The job was done in two days I had to purchase all the materials and pay separately The job was billed hourly but I would have preferred an estimate to stick to the price not knowing how long it would take It took longer than I thought it would since the installer was not here from 9 to 5
5,Mark T was the repairman drywall carpenter that came to my house from House Doctors Very professional and easy to work withHe repaired the drywall damage to better than new status and I am very pleased with the results I definitely will call House Doctors for future repair and house maintenance Thank You
1,We kept trying to set up an appointment We finally set a date and time He was supposed to arrive at 10am and I had to call him at 1pm and he said was I supposed to do yours today He said he would be right out but I had to call him back 34 times asking him where he was and he said the job he was at was taking longer than expected 4pm hit and he said we would have to reschedule but I said no because I had already taken that whole day off for him I didnt trust him to come out
5,It looks great I would use this provider again in the future
5,The provider came out this morning and said I should call to get a refund because the kind of work I need done is weather dependent and they recommended doing it in June or July
5,Finished product was good but 99 dollars of plastering does not go very far especially when more mud needs to be purchased from Sherwin Williams and the travel time 12 hour from my home is included in the length of the service call Also prepping the area and clean up afterwards is part of the time frame
4,It was okay It was a little more expensive than I thought or than they estimated They were fine They came in and did an estimate I guess they didnt figure it out and everything so theres a little more that they had to do Other than the cost they were professional
5,The crafts man arrived on time I didnt have the drywall so he graciously offers to go to Home Depot to purchase some which I paid for It was only 20 He worked very efficiently and it only took about two hours Im very pleased with The House Doctors and would hire them again
5,They did a professional job unlike what other providers had planned to do Rather than dig a new hole in a different location they removed the old post stump left from the original post that had snapped off at the ground They also installed it to the proper depth of about 36 below the frostline It was concreted in and sealed to deter eventual breakdown between post and concrete These guys were not a couple of hacks They knew the right way to do this particular job not just the quick and dirty the homeowner will never know way And they did it the right way I very much appreciated the professionalism and respect of me and my home that this provider demonstrated For this and quality of work I will enthusiastically consider them for future work
5,Christian  Bob were awesome Not only did they complete my crazy punch list but noted several items I MISSED that I should have had on the listin a we noticed way not a you should way Though it took a while to get us all on the same schedule page good for them  they are very BUSY once we connected I felt as though I was the only customer they had THAT is good business Thanks House Doctors
4,My thought was that the fascia was just loose but it turns out the stucco on my house was not sealed and rain runoff was seeping into the fascia and rotting the wood Significantly more repairs were needed I very much appreciated the advice the technician gave me and in the short term he was able to close the opening in the board  where rodents were entering I was a little disappointed in the cost estimate I received a few weeks later It was higher than it should have been and was presented in a manner that implied I better fix it now A little too much pressure They caulked the window flashingbut used white caulk on brown flashing and told me afterward I had brown caulk they could have used In general this job went okay but I think vendors see these small opportunities as lossleaders to get their foot in the door
5,It was good They did a good job The only thing was they ran out of mud and used ours They left the lid off the mud so we lost that bucket of mud
4,path was rough and the company wanted more to complete the work
5,ng on Angies List everything went according to plan An appointment was made and although we were not present at the time of service it was performed as promised I am blind and therefore cannot personally rate the quality of the job but my wife said that it was fineAfter some initial confusion since the house I wanted to be washed was not the address I was usi
5,House Doctors pressurewashing made the back yard patio come alive again Job included doing the landing step that surrounded the glassedscreened in porch and the shady sidewalk that lead to the front yardon all sides the view is pristine now Great job would use again
5,It went well Installer went with me to buy the materials I wanted then come home and installed it all
5,Work was done pleased with service Big deal was somewhat limited in what they could do Overall pleased
4,The provider called within 48 hours to schedule the appointment They showed up on time and worked diligently for 3 hours to pressure wash my patio and driveway The whole process went smoothly and I was very pleased
4,The gentleman got everything done that I needed to so he did a good job I thought they were a tiny bit overpriced but he did a good job overall
5,The House Doctors showed up as scheduled and did a great job cleaning the siding on our house I wasnt home at the time they showed up but they did everything as expected
3,Did not come on time Had to buy supplies took lunch on my time did not complete jobRan out of nails
2,Extremely slow response and had to get the job done It took almost a month to get a call back in the meantime I had to hire someone else
5,Excellent service Timely professional Repair work was very well done
1,It looks worse than when we started They didnt make plans to come and fix it It was awful We purchased the coupon in May Theyve been unresponsive They schedule dates that we dont agree with They came out when they feel like it and not when weve made appointments for it Weve had different information when we talked to the company With what they quoted us the other day it was outrageous
1,Appointment scheduled for a month or more One hour before arrival time I receive a call that they would have to reschedule and that someone would call me back I explained that was not satisfactory because I had arranged to take this day off cancelled clients moved court dates as well as rescheduled a deposition I told the guy last name Vecchio who called that I wanted his boss to call me back within 5 minutes I did get a call back but it was the from the same guy and he said he had to leave a message for another guy named Vecchio One hour later still no returned call I reviewed other reviews and this seems to be a common issue with this company The company seems to then reply to a negative review by saying that since they have been in business 40 years and therefore you should not believe the review I WANT A REFUND THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE BANNED FRON ANGIES LIST I WILL MAKE IT MY PERSONAL MISSION IN LIFE THAT YEAR 40 WILL BE THEIR LAST YEAR IN BUSINESS THIS IS IS THEFT PLAIN AND SIMPLE
1,I was away from my office at the time of the call when I got back in I called them right back to say the date they requested 111414 I would not be available and could I please reschedule She said that he would have to pull the cards again and would get back to me I have called several times and left messages on their voice mail but never received a call back I have emailed and they have responded that they would get in touch with me but still no contact On the morning of 111414 I received a call from one of their workmen that they were coming to my house that day I explained to him that I had cancelled that appointment and asked to be rescheduled He said he would speak with them and they would call me I still have not heard anything I would like a refund If it is this difficult to just get them to respond and to reschedule I am apprehensive of how they will handle the job I would like to request a refund
3,Representative said he couldnt do the work and that they would typically perform very basic tasks such as baseboards door molding small jobs in general However I need someone to install my finished cabinets
5,It went really well We went to Home Depot to pick out the supplies He was extremely knowledgeable and professional His craftsmanship was impeccable He was also respectful when speaking to me and when he entered the house I am very pleased and will use him in the near future Ms K
5,Very clean nice repair done quickly Everything cleaned up after the job This plumbing project will now make it very easy to turn the faucet off outside for winter weather The plumber came into the house did the job cleaned up and left the house within 12 hour
3,Did not go well House Doctors were to contact me by Oct 21 and I called them many times and eventually someone called me back the first week of November They were unable to schedule me until December and gave me many reasons why their staff were out sick etc Bottom line they could not perform the work
3,The gentleman from The House Doctors said that he couldnt do the job that I needed done He was polite I felt like he gave up and didnt try
1,In the end I was never able to have services completed and their lack of professionalism concerned me that the quality of their work might be similar Had several large projects that needed to be completed and the provided clearly was unable to get organized I wasnt going to provide a negative review since I personally was not negatively impacted other than wasting some of my time but they have numerous deals and offers and so I think users need to be aware before purchasing one
4,Once the team finally arrived their work quality and professionalism were impeccable Unfortunately we waited weeks for the origina job to be done and no one has responded to our request for a bid on our kitchen A shamethese are great people with major prioritization and scheduling issues
5,Was very punctual Moved patio furniture off of the deck for me Only complaint is that the pressure washing unevenly blew off too much of the stain on outer deck so it was uneven when I restained it
5,The crews shifted around depending on what work was needed on a particular day but they were all very professional kept the noise to a minimum and cleaned up after themselves
5,Considering the mess that the original installer left it went well I was consulted about a few things as far as if I would be satisfied with the proposed fix Mark who did the work was very pleasant courteous and understanding
3,I paid Angies list over 3 weeks ago but then The House Doctors could only schedule a drywall repair session in December so of course thats waaaay too late and I paid for nothin I hope they will reimburse us 
2,Contractor seemed much more concerned with getting payment than actually completing the work Several of the items on the job were not done correctly and the contractor had to return to correct and or complete job Which he did Also the cost for materials was considerably higher than expected The Contractor could not provide invoices for the materials specific to my job to prove out costs He just supplied a hand written list of costs We had used House Doctors several times prior to this when the company was run by his father and were always pleased with the services provided Sadly we had a different experience this last time and will not be hiring them again nor do I feel that I could recommend them
5,We did not have the service performed just because they were unable to schedule a service soon enough for us They were very professional prompt and helpful in my communications with them though
3,I purchased the 99 special on 98  Received a message on Angies list to email my phone number Got an email someone named Bob would be contacting me Never got a call so sent a second message on Angies list on 913 Got a response on Angies list to send Phone number via email Did that again On 918 got a message someone would call me Eventuallymaybe a week later a woman called to schedule appt Said they only work 1000 AM to 100 PMand no Saturday work WOW great hoursSo for a working person that means you lose a whole day of work AnywayScheduled work for 1010soonest appt available On Thursday 109 got a voice mail that both guys are extremely sick and we need to reschedule appt Woman who left the message said since they had to cancel they would schedule me on a Saturday even though they did not usually work on Saturdays They would come out on Saturday 1018 I was to call back and confirm However the phone number the woman left was not correct So I finally found phone number on Angies list to call back to confirm The woman apologized for giving me the wrong number She said they would be out on Saturday 1018 between 100PM and 300 PM Sounds good I asked if I needed to have the materials there she said NOthey would go get what they need So I blocked out everything on Saturdayso they could come get this job done At 230 on Saturday I received a call from a man saying he was calling to schedule my jobREALLYY I was very irritated I said I was scheduled for TODAY Oh he saidOh nowe dont work on Saturday Again REALLY I was told on two different days that they did Still have the voice mail He said he would speak to the woman who scheduled me for SaturdayUnbelievable They really dont care about customer service I am now scheduled for 1028 However I am very leery about the quality of work they will do if they ever show up NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE so far UpdateWork was completed on 1028 The area around the new skylight needed to be repaired with new drywall and then the ceiling was retextured Also a section of the wall was patched Mark did a great job matching the texture to the existing pattern He also replaced a section of drywall in the garage wear I had plumbing work done I have no complaints about the quality of work He did need an extension ladder to perform the work but didnt bring one Fortunately my neighbor had one that we borrowed Otherwise he would have had to leave to get a ladder The job ran over an hour and I was charged 100 for the extra hour and labor That seemed a little high for an hour of work but I needed it finished
1,The man that told me to reschedule said what kind of job is it and I told him I told mike it was for drywall in the bathroom This man said oh the coupon is for very small repairs He said you need to read the coupon FYIIt does not say that on the coupon They were suppose to provide 3 hours So they told me to get a refund from Angies List and now Angies List will not give me my money back Im not happy
5,Job well done no issues and it was completed much more quickly than I had anticipated The workman was somewhat late and didnt call until after he was due but overall it went very well and I would use this company again
3,Everything went ok there were a few spots that they missed though
5,They did a wonderful job They replaced all of the latches on our drawers They were prompt and efficient
5,They are outside of my service area I was unable to use the service
5,They came as scheduled discussed the options and put the drywall The work is top notch and the staff is very professional and courteous
3,We were told two workers would show up but three showed up Things started out very good in that they covered many surfaces The work included repairing the ceiling by matching the ceiling texture The repair did not match at all The painter did not paint all the way to the edge which left a discoloration all around the room We called the owner left a message that the job was not completed to our satisfaction The next day the same workers came out  completed the work as requested The ceiling texture did match and the ceiling was painted all the way to the edge We were happy with the final product Why didnt the workers do it that way to begin with Instead it seemed like they were only interested in getting in and out rapidly We also contracted for new steps to be put in the garage The worker forgot his tool that calculates the riser height He then left to purchase the lumber Thank goodness my husband was there to make sure the stairs were done to our satisfaction They did turn out very nice and we were happy with the results
4,The porch and driveway look nice but he left standing water on the little deck It dried partly with a dingy finish I have to wash it and sweep the standing water away for it to look a bit better All in all he did a good job
4,when I was finally able to get contact with the company took over a week we arranged a date and time The individual arrived timely Hewas professional and appear knowledgeable His adult son also accompanied him and I assisted with completing various aspects They completed the jobs efficiently The thing I have a problem with is his poor responsiveness When the workmen completed the job I ask them to check something in my basement which they did and indicated that the contact person would get back to me that day or the next It has been one week and I have not heard from the individual Generally their pricing is very fair but I believe on 2 sections on my bill I was over chargedreplacing 3 light bulbs should not cost 25 and replacing 2 batteries in 2 smoke detectors should not cost15 By the way the fire department will do them for free forseniors They are close and do good work
5,Michael Rosipko did a great job and was very professional
5,One man arrived at my house with his gasoline power wash machine He asked if he could connect to my outdoor water spigot I told him to do what he needed to do and he went right to work At about an hour and a half later he was finished He walked the perimeter of the house with me and explained what he found during the cleaning process I was very happy with this service
5,They did great He fixed the door frame that I needed and he was out I had some other things that I wanted done but it was not covered in the Big Deal and that was okay He didnt charge me for the materials either What he did was great
3,I purchased a big deal for this service I was kind of disappointed with that They said they were going to plaster and I had a big hole in the ceiling And they said they couldnt do that So they plastered a few places but they werent too tidy We had a hole in the kitchen for the light and they patched that but they didnt put the fixture that covers that hole back I thought they should have done that When they left I had to clean up sweep the floor and that from the putty and little bitty things I was really disappointed that they couldnt fix the hole by the air duct and that basically what I wanted them to do They quoted me a price to fix the hole
3,I signed up for the offer but when the schedule came up to schedule service I discovered they are only available M  F 8  5 Unfortunately I have to be at work during those times
1,My husband called on 92514 to inquire about replacing some doors  received their voice mail He left a message  we still have not received a call back
1,I never received a call back
5,I was on a cancellation list and low and behold I was called and the plaster repair tech was able to get the work done before the holidays The 99 dollars for three hours of repair did not go very far due to prep times and the necessity for more product from Sherwin Williams which is 12 hour drive from my home which was included in the length of the service call The job itself was done well though completion had to be accomplished over several days for dry time before final finishing
5,I had to cancel I was called back a few days later to reschedule We picked another day I then decided not to do the pressure washing at this time
3,Never was able to set up appointment
1,He never responded and I dont want to move forward with this deal
1,Two weeks laterno bid no contact My wife gave a long list of work I guess they are too busy We try to support small business but it is frustrating when they blow you off Two weeks lost
5,They were very nice when we corresponded via phone and email but they cant do the service quickly enough Therefore we wont be able to use them to complete this job
4,They did a good job He was done with the job in an hour and a half The quality of service was good it was excellent I wasnt there He left when there was half hour left for the 2 hours I dont think there were any additional charges other than the 77
3,They sent a message stating they would call and it was open ended have not heard from them
1,I first made contact with the house doctor to get an estimate on 7232014 I must have had 30 contacts with this company via the email and a number phone contact via voice mail It took weeks for them to come and give me an estimate for the cost of doing the job They would call or email me to say someone will be calling or he has your estimate all figured out and he will call If you have the cost figured out then why have they not sent it via email There is something wrong here and I starting to wonder if they do not want to put things in writing
4,There were no troubles with scheduling and no additional costs They completed all of the work I had wanted to have done in a timely manner Everything was fine
5,There were a couple communication issues over what exactly was to be done during the job but I suppose that happens Overall Jay and the House Doctors did a great job They were willing to work with me to get the work done so I didnt have to take more time off work They made up for communication issues by giving me a price reduction They did a great job and cleaned up before they left They were very nice and professional on the phone They even did a great job of matching the original paint job on the house with the paint they used on on the new fascia boards I would use them again
5,Power washed dirt and droppings from siding giving the town house a clean and new look Will have this done on a regular basis We live near Lake Erie and house attracts a lot of bugs birds and spiders because of location We could not have done this ourselves and it saved a lot of work Price makes this an excellent value Dont pass this up
5,Best job ever Highly recommend I have found him to be incredibly conscientious and outstanding in saying that he will do what is necessary and do it excellently I will definitely keep him in my priority file for a job well done and above and beyond the call of duty He kept me informed and even texted me pictures of the work done I couldnt have asked for a better company A Dr JLJ
1,The individual showed up at the wrong home He wasnt sure if he had a ladder tall enough to do the job And he wasnt sure he had a hose long enough to go around the whole house He asked me if he couldnt reach what would I like to skip My house is a small raised ranch 1350 square feet He told me that he should get the front done in an hour and then go to the back I told him if he had to go over a little I will pay the extra We had paid for two hours I didnt stay to watch him during the job When I came back the next day it looked like he did the trim beautifully but the rest of the front of the house didnt look like he touched it at all I went in the back and nothing was touched I called to see if he was coming back I was told he can come back but I would have to pay the standard hourly rate He did give offer me 1000 an hour decrease I ended up not having them come back If it took them two hours to do the front trim of the house I would hate to think how long and how much I would have to spend
2,This didnt turn out well They didnt put any soap in and just used plain water The deck didnt get finished as they didnt wash the railings The person who came out looked sloppy and gave the appearance of not knowing what he was doing he was not professional We needed to have the work redone by a different company When I spoke with the manager about insurance licensing he was rude
1,When purchasing the deal on 82514 it indicated we would be called within 2 business days to at least schedule the service On 826 I received an email saying Mike Vecchio would be calling On 828 I emailed back saying I still had not been contacted On 829 I received an email saying Mike would be reminded to call me On 95 I emailed again confirming we still had not been called and that perhaps we needed to go elsewhere to have the work done On 96 10 business days later I was finally called by Mike He said they were very busy because of this 99 deal which is why it took so long for him to even call me I explained we needed some repair work done to the dry wall in our basement and that we had been pushing out our carpet installation waiting for the drywall work to be scheduled I asked for a Saturday appointment but he indicated they dont hang dry wall on Saturdays Mike instead suggested THIS THURSDAY which would have been today 911 Since it had taken so long for him to call he was going to get us in right away I had him on our car speaker phone and asked my husband if he could clear his schedule to be home that day Mike confirmed he would be there between 1130AM  1230PM I gave him my husbands cell phone number and asked him to call when they were on the way Today is 91114 My husband called twice this morning trying to reach Mike to find out when they were coming His calls were not returned I then called Mike at 118pm and he answered Mike indicated that he had us scheduled for next Thursday the 18th I dont know how this was even possible because when I made the appointment we never discussed the 18th I would have never agreed to wait 12 more days from the date of our first phone call We needed the work done Needless to say the job is not done I have now pushed our carpet installation out yet again MIke did offer to have someone come out tomorrow during the day but with this late notice neither my husband nor I can take off of work again My husband already lost a 12 days pay today waiting I told Mike I would be home after 6pm if someone wanted to come then but he said that was too late At this point in time I would like my money refundedThis is our first experience and I am sad to have to report such a low rating I am very disappointed I understand business is booming but does that really justify poor service
1,I tried to call them and left a voice mail for them on 9814 and 9914 but the never returned my calls
3,The person they sent out was nice and did a good job If I had just rated him the scores would have been much higher Unfortunately the communication with that person from the company left a lot to be desired The day they came out was actually the rescheduled date During my original conversation I mentioned that this would be ceiling work so I was told that they would send out 2 people to the job 112 hours instead of 3 I thought that was a good idea Based on their deal which was they dont provide the supplies I called their number in the morning around 10AM the day before the appointment to coordinate all of the supplies I left a message on both of the numbers they listed After not receiving a call back all day I called again at about 10PM and left a message that i was cancelling the appointment since nothing was ready for them to work with  Strangely I got a call back within 10 minutes After talking on the phone they informed me that yes they dont provide the supplies and theres an assumption that you will buy all of the supplies from them They wanted to get to my house survey the job then go back to their shop to get the supplies That sounds good but I own a house by myself I have a day job and I cant take the whole day off just for this appointment I also have some experience fixing up different areas of the house so I had a good idea of what was needed for the job I also reminded them that this would be all ceiling work The same answer of sending out 2 people was given I rescheduled the appointment for about 112 weeks later On the day of the appointment the person arrived as scheduled I talked with him for a bit about the job and showed him the area to be done He asked some very good questions and we agreed on what could be done given the timeframe of the work Only 1 person was sent and he was unaware that this was all ceiling work The job required 58 drywall to be hung on the ceiling so I ended up having to be his 2nd guy for the 3 hour appointment and helped him lift the drywall into place and I held it for him while he installed it
1,I called 34 times to have a job done on my home and no one ever picked up the phone and I was sure to call during business hours Not a good sign
5,It went very well They did a nice job and were prompt at coming out They were efficient neat and reasonably priced
5,Everything went well The work was done as requested and completed much to our satisfaction
5,There were no troubles with scheduling and no additional costs beyond the price of the deal However they did arrive a couple hours late to the appointment They washed the stone on the front of the house the back porch and a portion of the driveway Everything turned out fine
5,There were no troubles with scheduling and they were punctual to the appointment There were no additional costs and the service was good
5,Excellent experience The workman was friendly professional and efficient Did exactly what I needed done and in a short amount of time
2,I very much liked the person who came out Courteous professional etc He said he would call me gave a time estimate But he never called back No work was performed
1,The service was horrible The provider does not use any solution to clean and so there is really nothing he is doing other than wasting your water I actually asked him to stop washing the sidings mid way since I didnt want him to waste more of his time and my water I asked the gentleman who was cleaning if he can come back with the proper cleaning solutions but he said that his employer does not like using more resources to buy cleaning solutions since it is not his main line of business Why would one advertise for a service that they dont really specialize in and dont really care about That is wrong and unethical Stop lying to customers and stop stealing from us I tried calling the owner to discuss the issue and either refund my money or redo the job but he refused to return my calls I think this company is running a scam and people ought to be careful I dont know where they get good reviews from if this is the kind of work they perform At least return the customers call and come up with a plan on how to fix the problem not abandon the work and disappear Stop using Angies list as a way of getting quick cash from desperate customers
5,It went well Initially they wanted to use the same holes that were already in the cabinets However I eventually convinced them to create new holes and the doors close much better now
5,Very well done I would use them again
3,I will NOT be using them and would like my 9900 back from Angies List Found another contractor not on A L On time made suggestions had references and pictures of projects completed Quote was higher but got our quote the NEXT day not a week later
3,We had the three hours of work completed as well as two additonal hours of work at the standard rate The drywall has been applied through our entire basement and we asked to schedule a follow up to have the walls sanded We were told we would be contacted in a few days to schedule the completion of the work Its been three weeks and we have left three messages with no return call Quality work doesnt matter if you cant get anyone to complete it
4,I feel like the charge was too much for the amount of work that was completed
5,THE HOUSE DOCTORS DID A GREAT JOB AND WERE PROFESSIONAL AND PUNCTUAL BOTH IN RETURNING MY CALLS AND PROVIDING SERVICE
1,Called for a quote Chris came out on Friday 88 took information and said we would be contacted by Monday or Tuesday with a quote I received no call with the quote information On Wednesday I called and left a voice mail that I was wondering if a quote was available As of today I have not received any response Certainly does not want me to use them Very odd and not very professional
3,I bought the drywall service to have a repair made in the apartment I was living in The provider contacted me within two days like he was supposed to and asked for my phone number which I provided but we never spoke I had to have the repair made prior to my lease expiring and made that clear when the service was purchased I had to hire someone else to do the repair because I had to turn in the keys for the apartment I would appreciate it if you would refund me the 99 purchase price
5,Mark quickly set out to complete the drywall work as contracted through a special offered through Angies List He set to work on time was professional pleasant and neat about his work A kitchen cabinet next to the drywall repair in the kitchen was in dire need of repair To my relief Mark accepted my request for this additional work The task was challenging as the cabinet drooped the doors needed to be adjusted and the crown molding needed to be recut and rehung Mark returned within 2 weeks to finish the drywall and cabinet repair with trim workovertime on a Saturday morning We are very satisfied with Marks work and we would hire him in the future
1,This provider The House Doctors makes better cancellations than it does appointments For more than 2 weeks Ive been trying to make an appointment but either they do not call me back OR the number is the wrong number OR they have to cancel due to an emergency twice Im officially done with this House Doctor I was never even able to get an estimate for painting and drywall work on my home Time to try the next provider on the list I definitely DO NOT recommend this and I have a hard time even using this term provider
5,I did have to phone the company myself since it hadnt contacted me after purchasing the deal but everything turned out very well for the most part The gentleman was very communicative about any delays or time issues he and his assistant were courteous and professional and they did a quality job in all respects It was actually quite nice that the gentleman had an assistant because this allowed him to complete more work in the allotted timeframe Furthermore they cleaned up after themselves and kept the mess to a minimum which I appreciated
5,the job is a nicely finished job
1,Terribly I bought the big deal and they never called even after you folks contacted them on my behalf This is unfortunate because they appear to be a very good firm and I was looking forward to working with them
5,The provider honored the contract even coming back on two different dates to complete the job The dry wall had to dry and the area on which the work was done had to be touched up with matching wall paint Getting the right color paint took me a couple of trips to Home Depot before I finally contacted the provider to let him know I was ready for the touch up The job looks very good
5,The provider was prompt in contacting me However the company was not able to come out and do the work until later the following week I was able to find another provider to do the work sooner
3,We purchased an Angies List deal with the House Doctors that was 99 for 3 hours worth of plaster repair which ended up being two workers for an hour and a half We were contacted in a timely manner etc and the work that was done was of good quality But I was asked to provide drywall of all things and garbage bags and I was still was charged 20 for supplies I am not sure why they showed up to a plaster repair job without dry wall I did agree to the extra 65 because everything I wanted done took a little longer but I still feel like I didnt get the deal I signed up for
2,Based on Angies lists recommendations I called and left a message over the weekend of July 18th I didnt get a call back so I called again a few days later Bob called me on July 22nd and we had a very pleasant conversation in which I described all the work I needed done He expressed gratitude for calling his company and I expressed gratitude that he called back He said his son Michael would be calling me to set up a time to come out for an estimate That was on 722 On 728 I followed up and left another message since I did not get a call from Michael or anyone else It is now 81 and I havent heard a peep While I do understand this is a very busy time for remodelingrepairconstruction I just find it very unprofessional that I was told I would receive a call but then never actually got it I gave them the benefit of the doubt and followed up with them hoping they would redeem themselves but they didnt I suppose if you are in the market for repair work its best to call during the winter
5,The most recent time we called them was to get an estimate on replacing a storm door We chose not to have them do that particular job However we have used them in the past and plan to use them again in the future
4,It took them a really long time to schedule a date There was contact right after buying the deal and then nothing for months Then out of nowhere they contacted me to set a date This was my only issue with them They arrived on time all fees were explained and they did a very professional job They also cleaned up well before leaving I would definitely recommend them if you have drywall work and the ability to wait
2,I already wrote an extensive review regarding the difficulty of contacting the service provider but the review wasnt posted I understand why the difficulty occurred but Im not going to write another review that probably wont be posted
2,It didnt go too well I was unable to get ahold of him before I purchased the Deal We wanted him to replace the wood ladder that goes up to the attic with an aluminum ladder When he finally came he told us that he couldnt perform the service we wanted so he patched two small holes in the wall That went well It took him about an hour and then he left
5,MARK did a fantastic job Got so much accomplished in 2 hours Would highly recommend
2,Nowhere on the coupon did it say they dont give estimates I cant imagine someone coming to do a job without knowing what they are going to do or what to bring in advance More than likely the job would not be completed in 3 hrs which mean I will have this eye sore in my living room ceiling until they can arrange to come back and finish
3,The soonest they can come out is August 8th
5,It went well It looks so much better They offered to come back to paint the ceiling but I had other work pending They were friendly They cleaned up after themselves They were helpful they explained what they were doing
5,It took a while to get an appointment because of the 99 deal on Angies ListI guess they were pretty busy Once I got the appointment though everything went well Mark was very professional listened to me gave me options and left the room completely clean even after three hours of drywall repair He pretty much performed a miracle He has to come back to complete the job as it was a big job and took more than 3 hours He did great work and Im looking forward to having it done
5,It was fine The electricians were professional fast and very congenial All the repairs were done quickly and done well
4,Mike did a very good job and completed all the tasks I had for him in a very professional manner Very pleasant to work with also I was not sure if I would use this company again because I had such a hard time getting an appointment set up because Mr Vecchio said that they were very busy It took about 2 months from the initial contact to finally getting the work done I would hope in case of an emergency they would come faster I would probably use them again if I could get Mr Rasipko to do the work
5,The service was quick fast and easy Everything is working very well Thanks
1,I first contacted them for an estimate June21st they cancelled and said they would reschedule but never got back to me so I saw a Big deal and thought maybe try again but got no response I called left message twice and no return calls this is no way to run a business Ive used them before and had no problem but I am done with their service
5,The doors look great and Mike did exactly what I was looking for
2,They sent out 1 person and he came out on time but we were expecting at least a 2 man crew When I first spoke to Mr Vecchio I told him to come out and give me an estimate first but he said they would be ready to start the work when they got there The worker who came out showed up emptyhanded without any supplies My wife had to take off work and was very displeased about that she missed work without them getting the project taken care of so we have canceled the deal
5,The contractor arrived on time explained how he would do the job and then completed the work The plastering work in the family room matched the design of the rest of the ceiling beautifully I would use this company again
3,I purchased the deal and emailed House Doctors with several dates in Feb Did not hear back and ended up using someone else In April or May I received a phone from Mark Thompson who works for House Doctors He apologized for the late contact but House Doctors had been booked up Probably due to Angies Big Deal He was very nice and I probably would use them in the future on a more flexible project
1,I have used them before and was very pleased with them They returned my call in a matter of minutes and were here within two 2 hours This time I called Monday 62314 and got a recording saying the would get back to me soon I didnt get a return call on Monday 623 or Tuesday 624 I called them again on Wednesday 625 and got the voicemail again I left my name an phone number It is now Saturday and still havent heard from them I will call someone else on Monday I will not recommend them to any one The least they should done is call and told me they unable to do the job
5,Ive used House Doctors in the past and will use them in the future should I need any handy man services They are responsive and reliable
5,The guy who worked on the house did an excellent job It was not small accomplishment to get off the numerous coats of paint over the years and get the windows to look so excellent He was polite kind conscientious and thorough We walked through the project at the beginning and near the end He cleaned up after himself and cleaned up more area than he had to It was an exceptional job
3,The service was good It went as planned but I was a little disappointed as I felt it was incomplete I felt they were using the Big Deal to try and get me to purchase more services I ended up completing the job myself The guys were nice to work with but it was not a complete job
4,Not like I expected Miscommunication Not enough knowledge about lathe and plaster to make proper repairs
5,Pleasant worker and eager to please
5,They responded to me in a timely manner They put one piece of siding on my garage installed paneling in my basement and installed a pole in my closet to hang clothing on They also boarded up my garage window that was missing I paid extra to purchase plaster and paneling for the work we went to Home Depot together to pick out the materials The service worked well I like them because they are able to do lots of different things which makes life easier
1,Purchased an Angies Big Deal on April 19 2014 and received confirmation email Mr Bob Vecchio bobhousedocaolcomand replied with my name and telephone number I had a voice mail message the next week which I returned I had a second voice mail message the next week which I returned Not having received another call I called The House Doctors and left a voice mail with my name phone number and my I was calling I never heard back from anyone at The House Doctors
1,It was fine until my appointment day He said he would be arriving between 812 today At 230 he has still no shown up I called and left him a voice mail He called back and hour later saying I was second on the list but I fired him I could have been out getting things done instead of waiting all day on him to show up when he was supposed to
4,It turned out okay There was a delay in getting them to come out on the side of the service provider When they did come out it was just one tech I was not at home at the time
4,He was a very hard worker and reduced my bill due to a miscommunication regarding his start time In a confirmation call from his boss he stated that a worker would be there between 9930am The worker showed up around 1115 He stated that he never starts that early and apologized for the mixup I did contact Angies List initially when I was trying to set up the appointment I was having difficulty getting my calls returned
5,It went well The worker was on time and was polite and professional He did a good job The scheduling was acceptable and they were out within about 34 weeks The cleanup was good
5,This was an Angies List Big Deal He had to reschedule twice but once he got here he did a nice job He let me know up front how much he thought he could get done within the 3 hours included with the Deal and the rate for additional work We agreed on the order he would do things and he got to work The patio looks MUCH better and the siding too He was careful to move a set of wind chimes I had missed so they didnt get damaged by the spray
5,Scheduling was good The fence looked nice when they were finished
3,Ive used them for other projects and the work was OK but again the pricing was way too high
5,After purchasing the deal they were busy and we had to wait for open availability As soon as they had an opening they were able to come out right away They completed the work and cleaned up well They were no additional fees beyond the cost of the deal My experience with them turned out very good
5,They were very good I am trying to get him to do other work for me They were polite and professional They had good ideas on things I was looking at They cleaned up well after themselves
1,Gave supplier 3 dates as requested on original order Supplier a left voice mail to call I called multiple times but always got an answering machine Supplier called back twice but never set a date as I requested multiple times They dont listen to their messages as I told them to stop playing phone tag and give me a date Very unsophisticated group without an office phone or email They ignored the 3 dates I gave them and never offered another Placed order on 531 gave up trying on 610
2,I never received a call back to schedule the appointment
4,On time professional did a good job
5,Came immediately to try to find a rat in my house  was to return the next day but could not due to family issues Did return and stop up all possible entries for rodent Clean work Unfortunately did not find rodent
2,Nobody called I sent another email WEEKS later and still no reply Finally I received a call from someone but I was out of town I returned the call and there was only voice mail We played phone tag for a couple of days and then I received a voice mail message that I was being put on their schedule for sometime midJuly I dont have my calendar with me at the moment  Of course I will accept this date it looks like I have no choice I am worried about the quality of the work that I may get seeing how poor their customer service is The Deal was purchased on April 8th So in essence its going to be 3 months before I get the work done That I believe is a record for any deal that I have purchased through Angies List Too Long
1,I reached out a few times to get some more information and I never heard back from them I would not recommend this company
5,Everything went well and we were very happy with the service Scheduling the work was easy the twoman crew arrived on time and it did a great job without leaving behind any messes
5,We were very pleased with the work They were very professional and worked very well Rick was very good about explaining things as they went along If they were going to be late and they were on two occasions they did try to call and let us know All the work is beautiful you cant even tell where repairs were made Great job
1,I had water damage in basement during the cold Plumbers came out to fix the problem and these guys came to rebuild basement They insisted on half money up front They got a permit and things that they were supposed to do The quote was rather high but I wanted it done right I gave them a little more than half when I received my insurance check My neighbors noticed they were not putting in the moisture barriers in the walls The inspector also came out and noticed some plumbing issues and called that the work be stopped until the plumbing was fixed properly The plumbers corrected the problem but since then House Doctors have not come back out to complete their portion of the job I just want my basement done I also noticed that a shovel was missing and my basement dryer was not working It turned out they never turned the gas back on They still have a huge mess and all of their materials in my basement I have paid them all of this money but the work is not done They are ignoring my calls not picking up their stuff giving me any of my money back or completing the work
5,The job went extremely well They called promptly after I signed up for my Big Deal They called to confirm and arrived during the window they said the would They checked in with me through every step as the job clearly was going to take more and resources than what I paid for in the Deal They completed the job to my satisfaction and they cleaned up after themselves I would definitely use them in the future
5,They do very good work I wish they wouldve called before they showed up The painting job looks great
5,He was polite and did his work He completed all areas that were requested Great Job
5,Looked at what needed to be done and told us what they were going to do which they did Finished work in timely fashion
2,I left a message He got back to me and told me he was looking at after June 19 I called him back and left a message with possible dates and he never called me back I got someone else to do the work
4,Job went ok Provider did what I paid for and showed me how to finish the job myself
3,Ive been calling this contractor off and on for over a month and have never received a return phone call The number listed goes to a voice mail that only states the telephone number With such a high rating here on Angies List I was expecting more Im still hoping to hear from them
5,Scheduled and showed up right on time Work performed fine My concrete and brick are pretty old so I didnt have high expectations They did the best they could do with what they had to work with The House Doctors did everything as promised Id use them in the future for other projects
5,He was very professional and personable We did not have to wait long for an appointment and he showed up on time He cleaned up after himself and even offered advice on other work items we need done
5,Very friendly guys and quick service Helpful and informative It worked just as it usually does with The House Doctors I continue to use them because I have such a great experience with them every time
5,I purchased a 99 big deal on Feb 12th 2014 and a few days later received an email asking for my phone number so they could contact me which I sent however after several weeks they still had not called to schedule so I called twice and left messages before receiving a reply by then they were booked out for several weeks so the soonest they could come out was beginning of May Mark arrived on time and was very polite they did a good job of cleaning up after themselves and covering everything during the process to minimize dust I did need to pay an additional 17000 to get the job done right second coating of dry wall plaster requiring 2 additional hours of labor plus 40 supplies I was a little taken aback by the additional cost but do feel they did I good job However at 65 per hour of labor for 2 guys I will definitely do the repainting myself
1,He never bothered to call back
3,Overall it went ok They said they couldnt do two stories which I wish I would have known I also had to pay for some additional time to get the job finished and it seemed like they charged me for an hour to cover a half hours work If I could do it over I would not purchase this Deal again
1,When I tried to get an appointment set up they told me it would be way far out The man I spoke with was rude and did not have common people skills and didnt know how to talk with people He told me to just get a refund
4,Work was done less than 3 hrs but had to pay additional cost for parts
1,Ive tried contacting them repeatedly but I havent gotten any response
4,Generally the work was OK The problem is that there was a push to agree to more work and the the time we didnt want it done Within days I contacted them again to do followup work and do the next phase of what was started and I never heard back from them
1,When I call for my appointment they service provide told me he could not do the work until May 6 which was over 4 weeks away I really wanted the work done so excepted the day because my Big Deal was going to run out but it was not a very convent day to get it done I took off work and wait for him to show up They did not even call me to tell me they were running behind I had to call twice to find that out Then they strung me along all afternoon telling me they me there in an hour Finally at 4 pm they called and ask if they could come tomorrow No you cannot come tomorrow I have work If they had call me that morning and told me that they could not make it I could have gone to work but because they did not call and then they strung me along all afternoon I wasted the whole day I do not think they did not have any plan to do the work that day I think they forgot about my job completely Also I think part of the problem is I have the Big Deal and they did not want to honor it
1,It did not go They did not answer me contact me or anything Angies List or they got the 99 for nothing
5,Jim called to say hed be 12 hour late but arrived on time and paid close attention when I showed him the work I needed done which included 2 ceiling cracks and several holes in the walls caused by appliance installations etc He went right to work and explained that one of the cracks would require a longer time to complete because the ceiling needed to be cut out and replaced with drywall He had thoroughly inspected the damage and determined that the previous attempt at repair was shoddy and the ceiling had not been attached to the ceiling properly The other crack in the ceiling did not require replacement and he was able to lightly plaster the crack which would then be painted over so that the crack didnt show The previous owner of the house had not used the ceiling fan in the shower resulting in a sagging ceiling Jim worked on the ceiling in the bathroom and got it fixed the patched the various holes then went for matching paint which I paid him back for  and when he returned the ceiling was dry He then painted the ceiling in the bathroom and the results were wonderful Beyond the original deal of 99 for 3 hours work I paid an additional 180 3 hours extra at 60 per hour plus 48 in supplies For a total cost of 279 plus supplies I was very pleased with the job and will set up another time to have the hallway ceiling cut out and repaired I felt the price was right for the amount of time that was taken and Jims attention to detail was great He even climbed a ladder into my attic to make sure that the shower fan was vented out of the attic not just blowing moist air into the attic The end result was beautiful more than I could have hoped for
5,Took advantage of an Angies List Big Deal and glad I did Jim was the man who did the work and he was very professional even fixing a couple of things I should have mentioned and didnt If Jim represents the type of person and quality of work to expect from House Doctors we will be using them again Very pleased with everything he did
5,The guy who did the work showed up about 30 minutes late but did call to let me know The owner showed up close the end of the job I paid an intro discount for 3 hours of drywall work The work was done very well however what I thought was a pretty small job patching an area approx 2424 and skim coating took 4 12 hours so I had to pay an extra 70 When he initially looked at it he told me he could get it done in 3 hours I also had to do the finish sanding myself they offered to return to do it but I didnt want to pay any more Overall the quality is very good I cant tell there was ever an issue with the ceiling Although it took longer and cost more than expected it was still far less than another quote that I got I am very glad I hired someone who knows how to do the job right instead of trying to do it myself He also gave me some quotes for skim coating and painting in other parts of my home and feel the price is too high for the work that needs to be done although I am sure the work would be good
5,The House Doctors as always did an excellent job doing various work around the outside of the house I always have full confidence in their work and they never let me down
5,It was an Angies List Big Deal that I purchased It went really well They worked well with my schedule They gave me a couple of openings and one worked really well for me I basically said there were two days that I could be home and they made it happen They showed up on time The guy they sent knew how to do the work He knew the best way to do it and knew how to do it up to code They cleaned up I paid an additional 270 over the deal
5,Couldnt be happier with the dry wall repair job that Mark did for us on a 99 Deal I paid for it in Feb and asked if they could hold off till warmer weather for the work because thats when the pops are worse Mark came on 423 as requested and this is a challenging area to work on in our house Its been repaired twice before but Mark tackled it really well and it looks ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL It may not last forever but he did a fine job and is a great representative for his company  polite friendly and very talented You wouldnt be able to tell that any work was done on the ceiling cause it looks so good This problem was part of a really large project done for us by Jeff Desatnik in January of 2013 Unfortunately the 2 bad nail pops reappeared in the summer along with the loose tape in the ceiling joint I left several messages for Jeff in Aug and Sept and actually talked to him a couple of times too but he never showed up here I know hes busy with big jobs like our original one but we hoped he would find the time to fix the problems we encountered in the areas he repaired in January We liked Jeff a lot but are VERY disappointed in his lack of follow through for us
1,Purchased 99 for up to 3 Hours of DrywallPlaster Repair on 09032013 It has been 7 months and I am still waiting for Bob to be healthy enough to do the work Angies List is supposed to filter out providers like this Very poor communication and customer service
5,The garbage disposal in my kitchen literally fell off of the bottom of the sink when I turned it on The clamping mechanism had become loose and the unit fell down when the vibration of me turning it on made it come totally loose The House Doctors were called at 330 pm and the plumber arrived 3 hours later as promised at 630 pm He remounted the garbage disposal unit and also replaced several of the chrome plated pipes under the sink because they were corroded and ready to start leaking The plumber cleaned up after under the sink when the work was done and the left the kitchen spic and span
5,That went well The deal was for three hours of work but they were here a lot longer and they charged me a lot more It was expensive They had to leave it to dry and then come back for more They did a good job but it was a big job for three hours The clean up was fine It just seemed like it took them a long time which is what I remember but maybe it was required I dont know There was a lot more money and a lot more time involved but we liked them It all worked well and it looks really good you can never make out there was ever a hole there
5,They promptly responded to my call and set up an appointment to come out and do the work within a few days They came as promised installed the hose carrier no muss no fuss
5,bought a big deal for 2 hours of handyman service after a couple emails back and forth the work was scheduled promptly the handy man showed up exactly on time the work did extend past the 2 hour slot but he gave me the option to stop if I wanted to works great well worth the money to get that finished as I couldnt do it myself
1,I bought the deal on Thursday 410 indicating I wanted the service any time from Tuesday 415 thru Thursday 417 I got in contact with The House DoctorsBob Vechio Saturday 412 giving my phone number Bob Vechhio never called me though I left two voice mails for him on two separate days during the time period I had wanted the service
5,This was a hard project because it involved plumbing and dry wall After Marc got the dry wall up and painted a water bubble was noted in the ceiling All the work work Marc had done had to be removed It was then discovered that the wax ring under the toilet needed to be replaced The House Doctors sent Bob the plumber out to fix that problem Marc came back redid the dry and painted the ceiling and it looks just beautiful
5,The repairman came about two weeks after I paid his starting fee He was a nice guy that knew what he was doing The job took a little longer than I thought it would to complete Overall he was a nice worker that did a good job
5,They are very busy so there was somewhat of a wait for a time for them to come out Other than that no complaints or issues
4,I am updating my review below after the provider provided a response I understand that the owner was going through dental surgery at the time I contacted him I do wish someone called me after the fact to explain why no one reached out to me but understand that things happen Lousy service I dont understand how providers in the business of providing service dont actually provide any I emailed the provider and Bob Vecchio emailed me back on 46 to ask for my address which I provided right away I didnt hear anything so I followed up with him on 411 Bob emailed back and asked for my phone number which I once again provided right away After that nothing No call no email Even if he was the best man for the job I would not hire him at this point I appreciate timeliness responsiveness and basic professional courtesy  Bob and The House Doctors have none of these Just a big waste of my time
3,They came out and really only did about two hours of work They hung up some mirrors I needed them to fix some aluminum siding and the gentleman never even brought out a ladder He promised to come back to finish the job then the company never followed up with me The work that was done was done well but they did not do the amount of work I was expecting when I purchased the deals
4,One guy came and completed the job over a course of a couple of days We did have to do some rescheduling but everything worked out fine They did a good job with the work
1,I purchased a 99 3 hour drywall coupon which was stupid on my part You cant do much in 3 hours They basically slathered mud on everything leaving me with a huge project to do Months later all the mud has cracked and needs to be redone again anyways The guy talked to me for about 12 of the 3 hours Total waste of money I really wish I had thought it through as all it did was cause me to miss work lose 100 and have to tend to hours of sanding and remudding
5,When the scheduled workman called off because of a sick child they found someone to come over since I had the day off I watched the guy fix the stuck window that had been stuck open 10 years He was pleasant and explained both what he was doing and what my have happened to get it stuck It was once again a great experience These guys are the best and have the best prices They are my gotoguys
1,Did not return my call for two weeks
5,Great job polite and did all that was askied
5,Fantastic Mike began by clearly outlining what improvements should be made and was very familiar with the housing codes of the City of Mayfield Heights The depth and scope of services was significantThey capitalized on the few good weather days during March to complete masonry repairs on the exterior of the house installed a custom glass block window to seal a cold storage cellar and delicately removed an old tv antenna from a chimney They completely transformed the interior of the home by painting trim cabinets doors and the like with a lovely oil based enamel Kitchen cabinets also were updated with new hinges and handles that looked great Plumbing repairs included caulking installing a new faucet and filling in grout which was done with precision In order to solve the problem of an unsightly open space in the rec room Mike custom designed built and stained a beautiful bookcase Insulation was also installed to minimize heat loss The crew worked hard were on time and kept everything clean Mike kept me informed on the progress of the job and finished within the original estimated time frame I highly recommend them
5,My experience was fine The results are good Scheduling was great and they were able to do the work when I was not there
4,My experience was okay There was one person here doing the work and it took the full three hours We had to finish the project since he was only here for 3 hours Scheduling was fine and they were prompt for the appointment
5,I sent Bob an email and he as always responded right away Being a female homeowner and always being fearful of being taken advantage of it is always a comfort to deal with someone who respects you To hear Bob say Dont worry we will take care of you was such a comfort Bob has a way of making you feel like you are calling on a friend instead of just hiring someone This is the 3rd time I have had plumbing work done by The House Doctor and as usual it was done quickly and efficiently Robert called me the day before made an appointment time and showed up at that time He was friendly and professional When he was done he left the area clean and free of any debris Thank you for your service
5,Smoothly they were easy to work with and professional
5,The crew showed up on time with all the proper tools and aluminum material to be custom fitted to the garage door peopledoor and roof fascia The fit finish and color of all pieces matched the original pieces exactly Very professional crew they were polite and efficient
3,They did what we needed them to do but I would say that it was top quality Unfortunately they did not protect the sink which is one of those plastic marble type things So we got scratches by stuff they dropped in the sink The plaster was a little bit bumpy So they are not a company I would have back I know that they did not remove all the wall paper I had to do that and paint the parts that they have not done I am even looking at the plaster now and it is even potmarked The price was fine
4,They did a nice job Scheduling was not an issue
4,They contacted me after a few days of me purchasing the deal I needed it done within a few weeks because we were selling the house He said he wouldnt be able to come for at least seven weeks which was too long for me to wait
5,Good customer service technician arrived on time and did good work
3,The washing of the house was completed and he used the remaining time to wash only 10 of the deck The scheduling was an issue because I had to wait for over 30 days So I would recommend if you need the job done within 2 weeks
3,The crown molding looks really good He made a huge mess though because he cut the wood in my house in the room he was working in instead of my covered back deck He did a partial clean up using a small light pick up vaccum cleaner I had in the room which was not made for that kind of fine cleanup and when we picked it up it fell out all over the place If we had know he was going to do the sawing in the room we would have covered the couch because it was covered in fine particles from the sawing he did in the room Fortunately we were able to and did move the rug out of the room But our PC was in there and who knows what got in it Even though we had spoken a couple of times over the phone with someone about the dining room table he said he was not told about it and did not come prepared to do it so the pieces of wood he used to repair it were way bigger than necessary and I am now concerned someone will bump their knee on it The slider needed to be repaired and he didnt even address that directly He just did basically a patch job so the table doesnt fall when we have to open it The table is Ethan Allen so it is not a cheap piece of furniture to do a whatever kind of repair job on it I might use them again but I would be selective about the type of thing I have them do because of the job they did on my dining room table
1,I bought the Big Deal for 99 for drywall repair My first 34 phone calls to the contractor werent returned Then I contacted Angies List for help They told me that I had to use their new communication portal to contact the contractor I tried that too but no luck I finally got in touch with the contractor who said someone would call me back soon I never heard back I called a few more times Finally more than a month after my initial phone call the contractor called me back and we played phone tag for a couple days until he just stopped calling me back Ill never use or recommend them for work at my house or my rental properties As for Angiels List I wasnt very happy with the service from the Big Deal group When I contacted them a second time to request a refund they asked me if I would be willing to use another contractor if they would be willing to honor the original Big Deal I agreed and so they said they would contact me in 12 days to let me know They never contacted me so a week later I asked for a refund which I did receive Ive purchased several Big Deals over the past few years and have never had a problem like this Im not sure I will purchase them ever again after this terribly frustrating experience
5,They did an excellent job on 5 ceilings 3 of which had water damage It was all completed within a day and a half and not a drop of paint landed anywhere it shouldnt have been Thank you
5,They responded quickly and booked the work in a timely manner Mark performed the work and was very professional He cleaned up after himself and the work itself appears to be of high quality I am very pleased and will use the company again
5,It went great They were very pleasant people They were on time and did good work
1,I purchased the Big Deal 99 for 3 hrs drywall repair on March 1 and a few hours later received an email from them saying theyd be in touch soon to schedule I waited a week and then replied to the email to remind them that I still hadnt been contacted I did get an email reply saying that they would be in touch soon Its now March 20 and I still havent been contacted to schedule Have requested a refund of the deal from Angies list and have contacted other providers who have been much more responsive Can only guess that House Doctors cant manage the volume due to the deal but the fact that they didnt even call to tell me that or get me on the schedule is unacceptable Dont waste your time on this deal
1,I purchased an Angies List drywall special from the House Doctors but they never called to schedule the work I sent contact information and heard nothing so I sent another note only to receive a message back saying the information was received Ive called and left two voice mails and still not been contacted More than one month later Ive still not been contacted to set up work Needless to say I wouldnt want them to do the work now anyway
1,Bought drywall coupon 2714 Cannot get in touch wth anyone Calls and email not returned Waste of time and money
1,The service provider is very hard to get hold of After several calls without responses I am tired of waiting
1,They are very difficult to get a hold of It is not consumer friendly due to nobody being on the phone They do not call back in a timely manner This is very inconvenient
3,The provider contacted us quickly but was unable to schedule the work for nearly two months
5,He finished the patch in well under the allotted three hours including a run to the Home Depot for supplies so he found a few other cracks on the walls and patched those as well It took several weeks to schedule the repair but given the discount I didnt mind that very much
1,i WAS UNABLE TO CONTACT HIM SOMEONE NAMED CARL CALLED ONCE AND DIDNT LEAVE A MESSAGE I CALLED BACK IN 5 MINUTES AND THERE WAS NO ANSER i LEFT SEVERAL MESSAGE IF HE DIDN WANT TO HONOR THE COUPON HE SHOULD NOT BE USING THEM I WANT A REFUND AND WILL CALL
5,Scheduling was a little tricky but once I had an appt Jim arrived on time and got to work He worked efficiently and quickly and did a good job The finishing counter sinkingpuddying the nail holes could have been better but overall I am satisfied with the work
5,The House Doctor plumber arrived very quickly to fix the broken handle on my bathroom sink The broken handle needed to be taken apart analyzed and repaired with new parts The plumber quickly got the correct parts for the repair he came back very quickly he repaired the handle he cleaned up the area and was gone within just a few minutes All and all this was a very good service experience
5,My 12 bathroom walls were left covered with wallpaper glue and uneven from a previous contractor House doctors was able to fix everything and then repaint The walls look new
5,As described above the job went well as the worker was very skilled and professional
5,The job went very well The worker arrived at the time promised and did a very through job When troubleshooting he discovered the job was going to be larger than expected He informed us of what he discovered and kept us informed at each step of the process When unexpected problems developed he offered options and came up with solutions that worked We are very pleased by the professionalism of Michael Rosipko and hope to work with him in the future
5,On the coldest and probably busiest for plumbers day of the year I had a hot water pipe burst spewing water through my kitchen ceiling While I was able to turn the hot water off due to the harsh conditions I expected it to take several days to get repaired and had no idea how much it would cost I tried several plumbers but the House Doctors were the only one to return my call that day They came out that evening around my schedule and had me fixed up in no time Very professional answered all my questions while working to solve my problem and under the conditions extremely reasonable on price Highly recommend
5,They did a fine job and would hire them again
1,It was the worst purchase I ever made and my experience was bad He called me to book the appointment and he had to schedule a month out I had a mold problem on my back deck I needed addressed immediately so I had to hire another company to take care of it 10 days later a kid shows up to pressure wash the driveway when I thought it was going to take a month for The House Doctors to come out I was not expecting him to show up and no one gave me a call He did an adequate job I wish I could have gotten both jobs done I would have gotten a better value out of deal
3,They came out to complete the work I asked them to please call me if it was going to go over the 2 hours I did not hear from them They ended up trying to bill me for extra time I did not pay it and I hired someone else to come out and complete the work
5,Everything went fine and I was very happy he was able to take care of all my needs in those 2 hours Scheduling was very easy He was very pleasant in my home and did everything I had asked him to do
5,Everything turned out just fine and it was all straight forward One technician was here doing the work and it only took about 2 hours to complete Scheduling went well and they called me set up an appointment The results look great
5,The House Doctor sent Jim who performed all tasks in a professional manner for a good price Jim was prompt and responsive to all requests Job well done Thanks House Doctor Roger K
5,They came out and it was all done within a couple of days They came out right on time and I liked working with them Mike was very friendly very talkative at times he did quality work he knew exactly what he was doing and if you asked him a question because you didnt understand he would take the time to explain everything to you and tell you why he was doing it
2,starting over from scratch and removing the work that was done I have no choice but to do that I expected more and am very disappointed with their effort
5,The job went fine There was a small area in our bedroom ceiling where the textured drywall compound has pulled away from the drywall It took a couple of calls to get a callback The fellow that came out was courteous was careful about cleanliness and did a nice job patching and texturing the effected area This was part of an Angies List Big Deal 99 for three hours of work The only odd part was that after the job I was asked for 20 to cover materials The only material was the compound used for skim coating an area about 3 x 4 I paid it considering it a tip for a job well done
5,It worked out well They contacted me and then they came out as soon as I could schedule a time so they were prompt They did a fine job and they worked with me to do exactly what I asked to have done They were easy to work with and they were responsive to the requests I had
1,They showed up quickly took my money and never did the service I had to pressure them to send my money back
5,They did fine It was a sort of a Spring cleanup kind of thing because I had stains from the winter mold but they got it done They came up and did the work They did the porch because the driveway is so small and they still had time left They cleaned up everything and was gone
1,I called this company the week I purchased the deal in June of 2013 left a message and never heard back I figured it was spring and they were probably busy so I would try again later in the summer Later ended up being August and the same thing happened I called had to leave a message and never heard from them As of today I am out the 84 that I paid for this deal Obviously I do not recommend this provider
3,It was okay That was 18 months ago I was not necessarily very happy with the results of what they did They just did seem like they completed the whole job The price was reasonable they responded quickly but other than that I do not know what else
2,It took numerous phone calls and rescheduling multiple times before someone showed up I asked him to repair a rotten window sill after deciding to replace the sash chords myself The worker who repaired the window sill was proficient He was neat ontime and polite The runaround with the father and son team was beyond ridiculous
3,The service turned out fair They came back once to try and fix the issue but the windows still leaks They did try to rectify the situation They came on time and did what they said they would do If it wasnt for the leaking I would have no problem with the service
5,The work was fine I was going to have my son hook up the washer and dryer but after talking with Jay he had said that he didnt come up with the price but it shouldnt be anything crazy for him to hook it up He said they would call me to let me know the price Well they ended up just sending me a bill and it had a an extra 158 charge on their that we had not discussed I had already called a few other places to see what they would charge to hook up the washer and dryer if I had all of the parts The pricing was around 6070 I have tried to contact the company several times to discuss this extra charge I did talk to Michael on January 6th and they gave me a verbal quote of 220 Since then I have not heard back and I did call him on January 10th before I received the bill I would just to hear from this company so that we can settle this pricing issue Some of the things wrong with the service also were that he did not have a level to make sure the units were even He forget to put anti slip pads that I provided under the washers adjustable front legs He connected a hose that had holes in it to the dryer and glass box I did tell him that my son would level it himself and that I would take care of getting the new hose The cost of the additional plug was only 15 so I just dont understand the extra 158 charge He also left out my 10 senior discount that is listed on his Angies List profile page Update 11714 It is important that you have a firm understanding of what the charges are up front and make sure that you hear whatever the price is quoted There was confusion on the price but it has since been resolved
1,Bought the 3 hours but could not come for weeks and I needed a more timely response The worst part was how much the man did not care about the whole thing
1,It didnt no work performed no calls returned
4,However I had expressed some additional work that I was interested in getting done they provided a quote but when I decided not to get all the work done they quoted I had a very difficult time getting them to respond on the work I did want completed Trying to reach them was frustrating and I ended up going with someone else to get that work done
5,We had a handful of spots in our home with broken drywall or areas that needed cleanup They came in were efficient and made everything look great improved some of the stuff I did
5,Went well he completed all tasks on my list pleasant personality
2,Firstly I would like to say Robert who was the employee that did all the work was fantastic I have no complaints with the work he did or him He was professional super fast and did a great job Bob the owner in the beginning was responsive and offered a great service at a nice price Hence the D rating rather than an F rating Our original appointment was rescheduled then the day of the rescheduled service the time was changed by the house doctors You know life happens we wait for most contractors to be honest they are kind of unpredictable no biggie Robert came and efficiently and professionally did a great job He was here for 1 hour and 45 minutes he left and we waited for an invoice We were set up for an hourly rate for our service When the invoice arrived it stated that he was here for two and a half hours confused as that was 45 minutes more than he was actually here My husband called and left a message inquiring about the extra time after complimenting the job well done and being totally polite We received a short and dare I say snotty toned message from Bob saying that we were charged for travel time I called the next day to ask why in a professional nonconfrontational way as it is clearly noted on their advertisement on Angies list that they do not charge travel time He was rude insulting and almost to the point of yelling at me over my question I mean fair is fair I was charged 30 more for a service than I should have been and as a responsible consumer I wanted to know why It wasnt a lot of extra money the price was actually good for the nice job that was well done but I found the upcharge to be underhanded He explained to me in a very condescending way how we lived so far away that I should be glad I wasnt charged more and they bent over backwards for us There are also 5 other jobs listed that were done in our area so they do come to our area Also when the job was accepted my location was known by Bob and if he wanted to charge me travel costs he should have told me up front especially since they advertise differently The funny thing is I would have had no problem paying for travel time had I been told about it and actually I did pay the bill in full He was so unprofessional with me I felt uncomfortable not paying in full in fear there may be some repercussion for me not paying the full invoice amount even though he told me not to pay it while he was nearly yelling at me and hung up on me I worked in customer service for 22 years I have never treated anyone like this and know I didnt treat him like that it really bothered me My advice if you hire this company please plan on having NO questions and No problems as they may be handled very inappropriately and poorly  I also noticed a very similar review from another customer on this site about how Bob handled their complaint Seems this isnt an isolated incident
5,The staff from the House Doctors are always great The problem was fixed quickly and efficientlya small metal bottle opener had gotten wedge in the garbage disposal It now runs perfects and the old bottle opener was trashed
5,See above  all went very well and I would use them again
5,Mike did an amazing job He came on time and did everything he said he would do I would recommend him to my friends and family
1,Played phone tag for weeks didnt seem interested in actually scheduling a job or wanting my business It shouldnt be work for me to give my money away
2,We first contacted the House Doctors in early November after seeing an add in the monthly Angies list magazine for the House Doctors we made the initial phone call We were contacted the week prior to Thanksgiving and told that they were doing gutters following week We were quoted 69 per hour The Angies list add stated 100 off for members spending at least 200 The week no one came or called On Dec 9 received a call they would be there on Dec 10 On December 10 a gentlemen arrived We were surprised to learn he was an independent subcontractor of the House Doctors There was never any mention that sub contractors were used He was very polite and performed well however we should have been advised The problem arose when it came time to pay for the service We were quoted 69  hour plus the materials which consisted of one downspout elbow At a little under 3 hours plus materials the total should not have been much more than 250 However when the gentlemen contacted his boss from his truck and said he was told to collect 340 That is 100 more than quoted There was a lot of back and fort and we were finally able to pay the agreed upon price We will not be utilizing the services of the House Doctors again
5,I purchased 3 hours of work for 111 The handyman arrived promptly and worked diligently for the entire 3hour period He did a good job and cleaned up the area when he was done it was a big job for one person and he did a very nice job
5,House Doctors is one of the best companies we have ever worked withevery business should model themselves after House Doctors They came within two days of my call to look at the job and give me an estimate told me they would be out in two weeks to do the work came exactly when they said they would then would only accept payment after I confirmed that I had reviewed the finished work and was satisfied The work was perfect Would recommend this company to anyone
5,Home was immaculately cleaned and passed my wifes scrutiny
5,I was extremely pleased with their service They worked me into an already busy schedule to help clean prior to my sons graduation party Lori and her daughter worked really hard to get to all the areas I had requested they clean They did an especially thorough job on the bathrooms and on my wood floors They changed bedding in the guest room folded the pile of clothes in one of my kids bedrooms and helped me with a few other things not typically expected At the end of the day they made sure I was happy and that there wasnt anything else I wanted them to do before leaving I have nothing but compliments for them They were hard working quick careful and most important of all very pleasant and helpful
5,Prompt professional service accomplished exactly what I needed as the coupon price which was excellent
1,I called and scheduled for them to come and clean my gutters It has been 3 weeks and they have not shown up to do the work I have also not heard from them I just received a call from John stating that he himself was the one here that claims he cleaned my gutters 2 Tuesdays ago 12172013 He stated he was told by his boss to do the best job he could as everything was frozen I called to have this completed before Thanksgiving The gutters are still full of leaves It is not my fault they waited a month to come clean my gutters They were NOT frozen when I asked them to clean them They should have called me to reschedule when they were NOT frozen as this is CLEVELAND Bob I have a check made out to your company which I will be more than happy to give to you when the job has been completed properly and to my satisfaction
5,The work was performed in a professional manner the representative was personable and very knowledgeable did an outstanding job and worked very efficiently
1,It was an Angies List Big Deal that I purchased It did not go well I needed the job completed for an inspection It was a violation on an inspection and I explained it to a guy named Bob I told him that I was going to need pictures prior and he said that he would have to take down some of the drywall and replace it I told him that I needed pictures while he was doing it and I needed it done by a specific certain date which was the date of the inspection According to my tenant he showed up and started the job and then said that he would have to come back and then we never saw him again until a month later when he showed up to finish the job It was 3 weeks after the inspection so I had to have somebody else finish it They sent me a bill for over 700 They never called me and I kept sending them text messages to ask them if it was done or when it was going to be done and where the pictures were They never responded to any of my text messages I left voicemail messages and they never responded I have no intentions of paying the bill they sent
5,We had our plaster ceiling in the kitchen repaired They repaired the hole in the ceiling and painted ceiling I would use this provider again but only if they had another special The hourly rate of 6500 per hour is a little dear for me
4,Purchased the deal in September Played phone tagemail tag Finally was scheduled then worker called in sick Rescheduled quote was higher than expected and I backed out Missed 2 days of work They were very understanding in my wanting to cancel I may do this at a later date but not now
5,Serviceman arrived a few minutes early was polite and had materials supplies and tools with him He did have to run to the home improvement store for something but returned promptly He worked quietly and efficiently for the three  hours and cleaned the area when finished
5,They were very nice Hard to make an appointment because they were very busy The gentleman who came did a nice job and was very professional
5,This was a special  2 hour 75 They were very responsive setting up the appointment and calling back when I had a question after The handyman was prompt clean and friendly Better yet he was very skilled He handled all the tasks listed in the two hours and then I had him look at some future projects I felt I really got my moneys worth The company and the representative were very professional and I would use them again
5,Michael Rosipko did a fantastic job under brutal conditions He was professional informative and efficient
5,Rod from The House Doctors came He is always professional and did a good job cleaning out the dryer vent line He was efficient and thorough
2,There were 4 halfdollar sized holes in my ceiling above my steps They didnt patch them they just put tape over them They did not do the work that was contracted to be done they were supposed to patch the holes up and prepare them to be painted With the plumbing it was a fiasco I had contracted with them to replace all my pipes they had to take the ceiling down and didnt replace all the pipes and again did not follow through on what they were contracted to do I feel like they took money for one job and ended up doing something very different I would not recommend them or not use them again in the future
5,The major item that needed taking care of and the report that I received was that the gentleman did a terrific job I had some ceiling tiles that had been damaged due to water leaking from a toilet upstairs He came in and replaced the tile that had been damaged and if I had found the same type of tile the job was done so good that you wouldnt know that it had been repaired He also replaced the caulking around all my windows and patched some holes in the driveway  I will use again I have a few more things that I need to have taken care of  
5,My experience went very well The staff was very professional and friendly while visiting They are a great company The pricing was reasonable and I would highly recommend them to others
5,The workman had not seen our configuration previouslythe gutters were actually glued to the fascia board It required some maneuvering to fix the dents from the branches that had fallen against them and crinkled them plus damaged the gutter guards The workman were pleasant and friendly They did a professional job and made it almost as new The House Doctors are definitely worth every penny I pay them
5,Ive called Bob before to help me out with various repairs This time I didnt know in which category my repair needs would be I know Bob and his crew did many things So I called him explained my situation and he sent someone out quickly to fix them My problems my pickup truck lost its brakes one day as I pulled into my driveway and hitting the brakes didnt work I continued into my garage and into the back wall knocking a few studs off the base far enough that you could see the grass in back from inside the garage A little while later I pressed the garage door button too soon before I had pulled out far enough The door came down and hit the top of the cap on the truck It left a dent in the bottom of the garage door and knocked the garage door roller off the track I called Bob in a panic but he assured me he would get out to fix it quickly and I was not to worry True to his word I had someone here within a short time You cant see where the back was repaired it was done so expertly that even the siding on the outside doesnt show signs of ever having been damaged He got the garage door straightened out and the roller back on its track Except for a small indentation on the bottom of the garage door it looks and works as good as new It seems like the House Doctors can do almost everything Theyve always been so responsive and professional And they get the job done well It reminds me of the Ghostbusters saying Who do you call Ghostbusters But I say Who do you call House Doctors It helps that I was allowed to pay for it in 2 installments with no interest or fees and I got a 10 senior discount
5,Overall they are great to work with There were at times some issues with some of the work Given the scope of all the work we were doing this is not surprising What is important to me is that they are responsive to feedback and concerns Not only were they responsive but the crew really went out of their way to address any issues that come up We are continuing to work with them and I would recommend them without reservation
5,could not have been better I read on line about assemble of the shed I knew that I could not do this even with help of a friend It is perfect I have used them in the past and will continue to use them in the future They stay in touch through out the entire process
5,See Above Power washed the house scraped caulked and painted the house and shutters
4,It went okay I had to pay extra money for the second half of the house but they did a good job
4,Purchased the deal try to contact them multiple times No one answers the phone Finally got a call and the earliest appointment is one month later So I had to find someone else to do the work thus want to cancel this purchase Thanks
4,Responded within a week and gave me a fair estimate
3,I bought a big deal coupon for the House Doctors Someone came and did great work I was happy enough with the service to purchase a second coupon Unfortunately after numerous phone calls the company and I were unable to come to a mutually acceptable date for the second visit I am averaging my good experience with my less happy experience to get the C grade really more like a B
2,My experience was dissatisfying I called late in the season and they came to put the coat Cracks and damage started to appear and I asked that he come repair the cracks He said it was too late in the season and would not come back to repair the driveway
5,First they checked the roof and thought they had found the problem so they repaired and painted the garage ceiling and wall but then it rained and caused a big hole in the ceiling and caused the wall to bubble They came out and looked at it and contacted a roofing expert who said that we needed to replace all of the shingles that it was caving in and would cause more problems if not done
2,I spoke with the provider about my job prior to purchasing the big deal and was satisfied with using them After the purchase of the deal I did not hear from them I called several times a week to multiple numbers and left messages but did not receive any calls for over a month The last time I called I advised that I was very interested in using their services and I was not in a hurry but just wanted a return call to get an idea of when we could schedule but I would have to seek a refund if I did not hear back I bought the deal for 1 job but I have multiple rental properties and have been seeking a new handyman to work with for future jobs I was very disappointed overall
3,It all went downhill quickly after the initial six hour Spring Clean Since I was very pleased with the initial cleaning of my home I scheduled The House Nurses for biweekly cleaning The first of these visits did not go nearly as well as the initial cleaning of my home Laurie the owner was accompanied by her daughter Laurie did a good job with the cleaning she performed However she was not very organized and did not seem to know what her daughter was doing Tasks that I specifically noted as being a priority such as low dusting of furniture were not performed When I asked about it Lauries daughter stated that it was done but got dusty again after vacuuming I was in the room and I was sure that it hadnt been done I can understand something being overlooked However I have a problem with lying about it When they stated that they were finished I was very surprised Almost nothing in the living room had been cleaned most notably the glass topped coffee table When brought to their attention they did clean the coffee table before they left I would rather they had budgeted more time and did a better job of cleaning I had expressed this to Laurie Two weeks after this housecleaning The House Nurses were scheduled to clean again On the appointed day they did not show up and did not call to cancel Very unprofessional
5,We contacted the House Doctors for a handyman special for our house After speaking with the owners about the house project we asked them about a large drywall project at our church They gave us a bid which was below some others that we had received and a couple of weeks later sent their crew to begin the project The crew presented themselves in a very professional manner were very friendly and open to suggestions for some minor changes in the project They cleaned up after each days work and were on time each morning to begin the work The drywall project included installing firing strips application of drywall and painting It involved working between 8 to 15 feet off the floor The job was beautifully done and received quite a few positive comments from our parishioners
5,It was fine I gave them a tip but I didnt spend anymore than the cost of the Big Deal They were very nice they did their job and then left I would use them again with an Angies List discount but their regular price if I remember is a bit hefty so I dont know if Id use them without one
1,I am requesting a refund because they would not answer and return my calls
2,We called this provider but they never returned our call
3,Both young ladies were delightful but explained to me that the service was a little unorganized since the owning partners spit and the staff was reduced by half It was apparent that neither girl enjoyed the work but at least one of them attempted to accomplish the task The younger girl was not at all experienced in the housekeeping field and needed total supervision from her coworker Nice girls but really unenthusiastic about their jobs It was a little Disappointing especially since they advertised it as Spring Cleaning The service was simply light surface cleaning I do hope the owner can get her business straightened out she was very responsive to my calls and very accommodating with days and times
5,I love them They are fantastic I would recommend them in a heart beat They went over and above and knock themselves out we will have them back
5,Three crews showed up on schedule and went about doing the interior exterior and 2nd floor all at the same time All work was done very neatly no flaws and the crews cleaned up all the areas perfectly All work done very quickly and professionally The manager came by the next day to inspect the work and ensure everything was done correctly
5,He did a good job of painting Clean up after the job Was professional
5,I am very pleased with the work done by the House Doctors The workers were always on time They were polite They cleaned up everyday when they were done They kept me informed about what was going on There was a lot of sanding and scraping to do I was amazed how well they cleaned up all the dust and paint chips They did a great job tuck pointing and painting the walls The epoxy floor looks outstanding The basement looks 100 better Brian always returned my calls if he was not avaible He explained everything that was being done He worked around a few days when I was not avaible I will use them again when I have a problem
3,There are a lot of reasons this review should be more positive However the problem for me was in the communication When the handyman showed up on the 19th Mark he could not have been nicer more professional and the job was fantastic He called ahead to let me know he was running a little late cleaned up meticulously worked very fast and carefully and was flexible in working with me as I got materials for one of the jobs Also Bob the fellow who communicated with me via email was responsive and helpful However in the interim between one of the fellows Mike who was supposed to have taken on my job did not respond to phone calls left messages to call him and suggested times to do so but then did not pick up the phone so that was frustrating and I lost time with that If I had not already bought the big deal I would have moved on but I had paid for the work and needed someone to do it We finally talked on the phone and Mike very kindly fit me in to work with my schedule I understood we were to meet on Aug 16th sometime between 10 and 1130 am Mike called me on the 15th and asked me to call He did not say why but I wanted to speak with him anyhow because I wanted better information about the time of arrival I called several times with no response I left messages that evening explaining that I would be leaving work the 16th and asking Mike to let me know a more exact time so I would not miss as much work I got no response The 16th I traveled the 50 miles round trip to be there at 10 and while waiting there called him a few times again to ask what was going on and again received no response I waited until 1230 and then left still havign heard nothing I emailed Bob that weekend just to let him know what had happened and got a response immediately The problem was fixed on Monday when I traveled the 50 mi round trip again to meet the fellow Mark who did such a great job Apparently Mike and I had understood different dates I can understand such a situation I cannot understand a refusal to call to tell me we had miscommunicated so that I would not travel out there the 16th for no reason So I am left in a quandary The work was outstanding and the workers very pleasant to deal with except for the communication issues If I had the time to spare and did not have to travel so far I wouldnt hesitate to try them again but I probably wouldnt risk it since both are an issue for me
5,He worked very hard It was a nasty dirty job and I was very pleased with the results
5,It worked out great I was very pleased He was very courteous and punctual
3,I bought the coupon and Bob called soon after At that time I told him I wasnt ready but had several things I wanted done I emailed him photos and a list of things I needed done He never responded I called and left a message with no response from that either In the meantime I had to have this work finished so hired another handyman from Angies List Towards the end of the coupon validity time he called but the work had already been finished I gave him a C because he did call right away but he should have responded to my email and other phone calls
1,never responded did not show up for the cleaning no calls nothing
5,Rod the electrician came to evaluate job He was timely professional and polite The evaluation took minimal time and I received a quote the next day Bob Vecchio scheduled work with me when I got quote and repair was completed that week
5,It took a bit to finally set an appointment multiple missed calls on both ends Would be nice if they had a live operator to handle calls Had an area on kitchen ceiling that had been repaired plastered a number of years ago due to a leak No reoccurrence of leak however area started to crack looked as if a repair had been done not very smooth kind of droopingPurchased a 3hour plaster drywall repair back in April Mark arrived on time had called to inform me what time he would be starting I purchased supplies needed for the repair I was given 2 options of repair work decided on the least invasive option after discussing what the best choice would be Mark did a great job protected furniture in the area where the work was being done He finished the job quickly ceiling looks great In the end he didnt need some of the supplies I purchased as he had some of his own available and the job didnt require too much All questions answered Would definitely hire again
1,Service provider never showed up when scheduled This was a huge inconvenience to the member please refund immediately
5,Everything was done timely and neatly
1,I left two messages on each of the phone numbers listed in the last two weeks and still have not had a return phone call I understand that this company might be busy but at least an appropriate response would be professional
5,They did a very good job Bathrooms especially exceeded my expectations There were a few areas they missed but after I pointed them out the team immediately fixed those areas I initially had a dificult time getting in contact with the House Nurses and didnt receive a call back after several messages left However they had a wrong number for me and once we realized this the housecleaning was quickly scheduled
5,It did take a while to get on their schedule but Im sure they get busy in the springearly summer They arrived on the scheduled date and time and completed all the work in a timely manner They even came back the next day to haul away the old broken gate
3,Generally I would say they were very courteous but the cleaning was only ok
3,I hired these folks to come wash my driveway Our snowplowing service left some rusty trails on the driveway during the winter and I wanted the spots cleaned off as well as the driveway powerwashed After purchasing an Angies List Big Deal from this company several months ago they were quick to contact me and set up an appointment They were willing to come sooner but I asked them to wait until June after we mulched as I knew the mulch pile would leave a big mark on the driveway that I wanted cleaned off A rep from the company called me the morning of the appointment to make sure they could still come out and perform the work as it was raining that day I said it would be fine as long as they could wash our driveway effectively in the rain She assured me it would be fine I appreciated her professionalism She said they would arrive between 1030 and 1100 to do the work At about 1015 a young man showed up at my door I was on an important phonecall and not ready to come outside since he was early I apologized for being on the phone and asked him to wait a few minutes He didnt even crack a smile or say anything to me He just walked back to his truck About 10 minutes later I finally made it outside and asked him to start on our driveway and then move to our sidewalk and patio when he finished the driveway He was unfriendly slow moving and unprofessional and barely said two words to me It just seemed like he wanted to be anywhere but powerwashing driveways Hey I didnt blame him but it did reflect poorly on the company Last fall I had another power washing company come out and wash our whole house all three sidwalks and our driveway as well as seal the driveway Two workers performed all the work in about 2 hours So I thought just having our driveway washed would easily be accomplished in one hour However the young man from the House Doctors was extremely slow moving and the equipment he was using was a small hand sprayer I peeked out at him from an upstairs window a few times while he was working and it looked like he could have been working a lot faster However I did realize that the equipment was also a hugely limiting factor It was obvious to me after about an hour that he was not going to even come close to finishing our driveway alone in two hours My children and I went for a bike ride around 1130 and returned home a few minutes prior to 1200 The young man from House Doctors was sitting in his truck with all the equipment packed up ready to leave I was annoyed because I had paid for 2 hours of time and he hadnt started working until around 1030 so he was shorting me a half hour But mostly I was annoyed because he had only managed to wash about 13 of our driveway and had not even come close to working on the sidewalk or patio I told him he hadnt started working until around 1020 and asked if he would get the equipment back out and at least try to go over more of the rust spots on our driveway He said he didnt realize he hadnt started until 1030 and he got the equipment back out and worked another 20 minutes In the end he managed to mostly remove some motor oil stains and helped fade the rust stains at the top of our driveway However the bottom 23 of our driveway were not cleaned at all I was so disappointed that he accomplished so little in two hours Even though I purchased this service through a Big Deal sale I felt like I was ripped off I did not feel like the work he performed was worth the 69 I paid After the service was performed I got on Angies List to read their other reviews and realized the company is not a powerwashing company They are handymen I had not realized this when I purchase the Big Deal as they were advertising 2 hours of powerwashing Perhaps their customer service efficiency and professionalism are better when they are doing other types of work I would definitely NOT recommend this company for their powerwashing services
5,They called quickly after I purchased my Big Deal to arrange a time to come out The young man who did the work was efficient and professional Knew what he was doing and kept at it until the job was done we had more work to do than could be done in the time allotted by the big deal and he gave a good estimate of how much more moneytime it would be
5,He did the work and he had extra time and asked what else he could do I would use them again if I got another big deal
2,We have an old house We purchased the faucets and shower and had replacement tiles Approximately four or five had to be changed for the new faucets Robert came out to do it all He was very polite and a hard worker However he seemed uncomfortable with the tile work He was pounding on the tiles with a hammer After the first trip he needed to order an extension for the faucet due to the thickness of the wall My husband noticed that there were eight or nine new tiles which had been cracked and chipped He told Robert about this and he said that he wasnt finished even though he had already replaced adjoining tiles He came back two days later with the extension and installed the plumbing and worked on the tiles When Robert was finished my husband noticed that some of the tiles were sticking out or in farther than the others Also the spigot beneath the faucet was not lined up with the faucet about one inch to the right Robert explained that it was impossible to line up correctly because of the construction of the wall We didnt think that made sense We were not to use the shower until the next day The next evening we tried it out and black water came out from around the faucet and then more water came straight downstairs through the ceiling to the downstairs bathroom I called Bob Vecchio and said we needed someone immediately He didnt return our calls so we called Robert and he came right over It turned out that he had attached the faucet to an old pipe and didnt try it out He redid it and it is currently working In the meantime we had received a bill from Bob Vecchio for 829 for the work done so far including replacing 12 tiles I called him to ask about being charged for 12 tiles not a good job and the fact that the faucet and spigot didnt line up He refused to talk about it and said Robert had explained everything to my husband to his satisfaction Not True He never bothered to come and look at the job He also said it would have taken too many hours to get the tiles right this being such an old house He said most people with old houses would have all the tiles redone with liftoff tiles He was very rude We decided not to have them complete work on the shutoff valve and ceiling repair as we didnt feel confident they would get it right
4,Took long time to set up appointment Patio looked good when completed Technician polite
5,My mom was here when the work was done She said the worker was very efficient and offered excellent and cheaper options
5,Excellent experience When the workman were late they called to let me know They were friendly cleaned up after themselves and checked with me as the work progressed This was another excellent experience with The House Doctors
5,Plumber showed up within an hour of my call and he repaired a toilet flushing device in our bedroom area Pieces for this particular toilet are hard to find but the House Doctor plumber did the whole repair within an hour
5,The post was on a porch that had been replaced some time back by the House Doctors It turned out that the roof of the overhang was empty inside A new panel had to be added to the overhang to secure the post
1,Had to call twice before calls were returned Finally got a call back and they said they would look at my driveway for a quote on resealing and leave estimate in my mailbox No estimate ever given
5,I was going to have the light replaced so I could have brighter light but the electrician said we could just use a different wattage I have used this company for several years The tech Rob was very prompt and the service was great
5,They were absolutely fantastic He arrived on time went out of his way to protect the rooms from dust cleaned up after and the work was great We would definitely use them again
5,We have some moisture in the attic and a hole in the drywall Mark comes on time and did a wonderful job Hes very professional and efficient He fixed the drywall and even helped to spray bleach on the attic to prevent mold We would definitely recommend it Besides before the job we communicate with Bob over Angies List Hes very helpful A very respectful company and we highly recommend it
5,They did a great job The house smelled great when I got home from work They wiped down all the surfaces in the kitchen and took care of the dishes Folded laundry in the bedroom that was left out and organized the dresser tops The kids rooms were organized and cleaned as well They took care to use a vinegar solution on the hardwood floors which was greatly appreciated Definitely planning on using them again
2,The first thing I was told before beginning was the area I was most concerned about would probably not come clean I expressed my disappointment in this and that area actually did look pretty good There are several other areas two that are very obvious to me in the front of the house and both of these areas did not come clean When I asked about these I was told that was as good as he could do I showed him the one area that I could reach easily that I could get it clean which I proceeded to do I have cleaned these areas in front of the house before He proceeded to show me in another area on the side of the house that if he put the hose almost touching the siding it would take the paint off and it did There are other areas that are still dirty and are difficult for me to reach I have had my house Powerwashed before and have been completely satisfied Not this time I do not feel this was a good deal
5,The only reason I would not use them again is that they were too far from where I live The gentleman did a great job I thought it was expensive but I really have nothing else to compare it to
5,It was really good They did an exceptional job
5,Very well Contractor actually beat me home to do the work was about 1520 minutes ahead of schedule Was very professional went right to work and completed the worked quickly He cleaned up and took all trash to garage as requested I found some other needs that I am going to call again to get their assistance Thanks for a great job
5,They were a little difficult to get hold of and scheduled Not terrible but a little difficult dont bother with their email but once they were here they were great I should also say nothing I needed done was an emergency Jim came on time cleaned up as he went and was very professional His carpentry was very good We had a problem with the door and called back They were very responsive and quickly returned to correct the issue We will definitely use them again
3,Not a good experience
1,I scheduled a time for them to come and do the work but they didnt show up I have been calling to confirm the date but they have not gotten back to me I scheduled in May and they werent able to get to me until Aug but they never showed up or called to tell me they were not going to be able to make it
5,The fellow Mike Rosipko arrived on time and did all the prep work He then crafted a beautiful wood gate for my yard It was exactly what I wanted and needed It was all done quickly and perfectly He then hung an item for me that I could NEVER have done properly I would use this company again I was so impressed by the efficiency and quality of the work Mike was super and had really good suggestions
1,The House Doctors wanted to charge me additional prices and I felt they should have been able to do the job within the 2 hours that I paid for I wasnt home when they did it and when I came home I couldnt tell where they stopped They didnt do the whole job but I couldnt tell where they had done the job I wasnt able to tell which part was clean and which part was dirty They told my son they used water instead of any kind of cleaning agent so Im glad I didnt pay the extra whatever they wanted per hour 100 and some dollars Their hourly rate was too high and I just felt it was a scam Ill give you 2 hours for 69 but its going to take 2 more hours and its 169 or whatever they were going to charge per hour I dont recall having any problem with The House Doctors punctuality
3,First off let me be clear that the service professional that came to my house was very nice and did the best work he could with what he had I am pleased with what he did but I paid for 3 hrs of work and he left after 15 hrs I am however extremely disappointed with the managers communication responsiveness and overall way that he does business I purchased the coupon in early May and was actually interested in receiving a quote from them for additional work however after several phone calls over a 2 week period to the house doctors someone finally returned my call while I was at work and left a slightly nasty voicemail stating something to the effect of if you dont call me back today by 130 you wont get scheduled for a couple months I am a nurse and not permitted to carry my cell phone with me during the day and after more than 2 weeks of inreturned calls I certainly did not feel it necessary to take time away from my patients to check for messages I checked on my lunch break at 215 and called the manager back He proceeded to schedule me for July 12th regardless of the fact that in the meantime we actually had some damage occur to our living room ceiling that needed repaired in a more timely fashion He asked what we would want done and I replied well if its not until the middle of July Ill probably just have you do cosmetic work and I will find someone else to do what I really need done His attitude was very oh okay sounds good see you on the 12th with no apology for the late call however he did offer an excuse stating weve been really busy Ive sold over 200 of these coupons This truly makes me want to stop using Angies List at least not even consider a coupon or deal knowing that providers do not put a reasonable limit on the number sold to be able to serve the customers that actually purchase them Final note I asked the scheduler on the phone if they would come do an estimate and he said that they would do an estimate day of service for any work above the budgeted hours which is not what I wanted but I truly didnt want any work from them at that point let alone any additional work so I didnt push it I then asked if there was anything that I needed to have for the serviceman when he came to the house and the reply was no hell have everything with him Upon arrival to my house day of service again the gentleman that came was very polite and did his best however he immediately asked me if I bought drywall mud I told him no I was told I didnt need anything The guy only had joint compound with him and he made it work however the corners are no better than they were before and I had to do all of the finishing work because the compound had to dry for 24 hrs before being sanded If I had known that it was only going to take him 15 hrs to do the work 1 I wouldve run to Home Depot to get the stuff that he actually needed and 2 I wouldve found more work for him before he left I was planning on painting my whole house he couldve prepared all the walls for me in that amount of time Overall it was a waste of 99 I couldve dine the work that was done easily on my own for a lot less money and possibly even better quality because I wouldve used the right materials
2,On May 28 an electrician arrived from The House Doctors and put in the new line it was an extension cord installed the camera did a very nice job with it and installed the motionactivated light on my back porch He said I needed a new kitchen faucet and a new ceiling fan and that he didnt have time to do the other jobs This cost me 470 and I had to take the day off from work When he left I thought the electrical line and the security camera were ready to go For the next month I had nothing but trouble with the security camera it kept going on and off and wouldnt record anything The security company was very patient with me as I made many many calls to them to help me get it going We of course thought that my cell range was the problem so as advised I bought a second router for over 100 My brother then discovered that the line put in on May 28 by The House Doctors was dead After playing telephone tag for a while they finally made an appointment to send the electrician back to see why the line was dead He came back on July 9 Since I had to take another day off from work I took advantage of the time at home and asked him to fix the dead line install a new porcelain light fixture in the basement and rescreen the back window while I was there After a couple hours he told me he fixed the line and that if I had any more trouble with it I should call the garagedooropener company that installed the original box He also installed the light fixture in the basement and rescreened the window This cost me 250 and another day off from work The camera continued to go on and off and did not work properly at all The security company told me to send it back and they sent me a new camera Meanwhile my brother discovered that the electrician had run the new line into a line that switched on and off with the garage lights that I controlled from my house I had to leave the lights on 247 until I could have the electrician come back to fix it again I contacted The House Doctors about this on July 25 and a new electrician was sent out on August 1 I had to take two hours off from work His first comment was about the extension cord used by the first electrician The first electrician had told me that adding conduit would be much more timeconsuming and costly so I agreed to the extension cord The second electrician worked on it for about halfanhour and said it was fixed I tested it I thought and it seemed to work but after he left I turned the lights on and off from the house and the camera stopped working I immediately called him and he came right back After a minute or so he said he finally realized what was wrong It had something to do with the relay in the box installed by the garagedooropener company Once he ran the line through the relay the camera worked perfectly I hope I worded all this correctly  Im electrically challenged The owner of the company called that night August 1 to ask me if I was happy and that he wanted to put a smile on my face I was smiling until he added You know I could charge you a little for that work today but Im not going to Seriously After two months of aggravation for me and my brother not to mention the expense and time involved two more visits by electricians and another ten hours of vacation time the unnecessary purchase of a second router numerous phone calls to the security company uninstalling the first camera and shipping it back and installing the second camera I was astounded that the owner would even hint that I should pay for the lessthanonehour visit by the followup electrician This job should have been done correctly the first time the electrician came out on May 28 After all this none of which was my fault or the fault of the first or second security camera in any way the son of the owner accidentally sent me a copy of an email he intended for his father in which he referred to me as a pain
2,After filing a complaint with Angies List on 782013 about a repair to brick molding which was coming apart developing black mold and leaking water into my house around my sliding glass door I received a call from Bob Vecchio from the House Doctors on 7122013 He indicated that he wanted to make it right However he would not be able to do the job himself as he no longer does his companys jobs due to the fact he has had a double knee replacement However he would send one of his guys to fix the work and he would get back to me to schedule an appointment I would have preferred to hear that he or his son would come out personally and fix the job on a weekend so that I wouldnt have to take more time off work but that was okay as long as the job would be fixed right and in time for the outside of my house to be painted During the week of 715 Bob and his son Mike left messages for me However due to a family emergency I was unable to call back until 722 On 722 I returned Mike Vecchios call to schedule the appointment to fix the brick molding around my sliding glass door At this time he indicated that he would send the same individual who did the initial work I expressed concern and asked for someone else since this individual didnt repair the job properly the first time Mike interrupted me and said it would be fine He said he talked to his guy and they discussed what should be done This surprised me since Mike never saw the work even though I offered to provide pictures in a previous voicemail I went ahead and scheduled the appointment with him for the next morning since I needed the work to be finished before my house was painted on 72413 Approximately 30 minutes after my call with Mike Vecchio I received a call from a 2nd carpenter who was referred by my painting company During the week of 71 when I didnt hear back from the House Doctors I contacted my painting contractor for a carpenter referral since my house was originally scheduled to be painted the week of 78 However due to rain the painting did not start until 724 The carpenter said he could stop by and look at my job in the next half hour as he was finishing up another project in the area I agreed to have him look at it When he and his partner saw the molding around my door they explained that the job was not done properly and that the molding would have to be replaced They said they didnt understand why 14 round molding was used at the top of the brick molding to keep water out Instead they suggested using flashing Also one of the corners of the molding was not secured causing it to come apart They also indicated that there was way too much caulk used around the trim It was quite messy However despite the excess caulk water was getting in behind the door and getting into my house and causing black mold to appear on the outside brick molding and the 14 round molding They explained they would need to replace all of the molding around the door scrape off all of the caulk and install flashing under the siding and over the top of the molding Labor and materials would cost 25000 Since I had confidence they would do the job correctly and since they could do the job the next day I agreed to hire them I immediately called Mike Vecchio back to cancel my appointment When I got his voice mail I left a message indicating that I was hiring someone else to complete the job and the reason why I also mentioned that Id like to talk to him or Bob and request a refund for the initial labor and materials However I did not receive a call back I only knew that he must have received the message when no one showed up the next day On 72613 I called Bob Vecchio to follow up and request a refund Bob returned my call that afternoon He seemed angry and he told me that he didnt think I was being fair since I did not give his company the opportunity to fix the job I tried to explain to him that I was willing to do that However when the 2nd carpenter indicated that the job was not fixed properly and since the House Doctors were only willing to send the same individual who did the job improperly the first time I preferred to have someone else do the work Unfortunately Bob interrupted me and talked over me multiple times When I requested a refund of 16758 Bob said he would offer me a refund of 12500 because he felt the materials probably didnt need to be replaced However he had never seen the work and wasnt interested in seeing pictures that I offered to provide He said he would refund me 12500 if I changed my review on Angies List The House Doctors has since refunded me 12500 the total cost of my repair was 29258 25000 to the 2nd carpenter and 4258 paid for some of the materials for the first repair At this point Im grateful that the repair is now properly fixed looks great no longer leaks and that I received some of my money back to defray the cost of the total repair Since Angies List does not allow for half grades I had to rank my experience as a D for the grade above However since I received a refund of 12500 I would say that my overall experience was more like a CD
5,I did use The House Doctors and that one turned out excellent They were neat clean and efficient I have no problems whatsoever They even suggested areas that needed to be repaired and fixed those also
5,Robert from The House Doctors did an excellent job was professional and got the job done in a timely manner I needed the work done by a certain time and it was done well in advance of my deadline
5,They did a terrific job locating a part for a very old dishwasher then modified it to fit I would definitely use them again
5,Did a replacement of a damaged ceiling and painting with trim added and repair of paneling in family room Replaced drywall in living room and hall Patched cracks in bedroom Installed lighting in family room On time all the way cleaned up as they went along and entire job done within 1 week
4,It was good I never saw them do the work They completed everything while I was gone It was not as thorough as I would have wanted
5,He was ok He did a good job but he was a little slow
5,Went well I happened to have some extra wall anchors to secure handrail into wall
5,Bob is always very responsive when I contact him The guys he hired were friendly and called the day before to let me know they were working in the morning They arrived as planned and worked around the cars in the neighbors drive to remove ivy They tried to match the tuckpointing color  talked to me about possible future repairs for the steps They went through thorny berry bushes to get to the old wood fence to take it down They then put all the debris in the truck They were friendly courteous efficient and thorough They checked with me on every job I would hire them again and will hire them again They are the best
5,It went fine I was not at home when they did the work
5,One of the crew was sick but came anyway since I was having a party in a few days Did forget their rags but ran out and got more Very good attention to detail when cleaning I was pleased
1,Everything went extremely well in fact it went so well that I have decided to take my time a write a review I very much enjoyed the responsiveness of The House Doctors automated prerecorded answering service It literally answers without hearing that phone tone on all 4 lines listed under contacts Super cool Oh yeah the recorded voice quality is simply stunning So I left several messages and left several more two days later Only about two weeks later since my initial contact I had a privilege to finally play this interesting game called phone tag with Bob I really dont have a job nor do I have life so I simply sit on my couch and desperately wait for that precious call from Bob to establish a direct line of communication and finally it paid off Bob called my cell and I picked up Hurray The arrangement was made for some one to stop by and inspect the problem Unfortunately I wasnt home I dont work remember but my wife happened to be home Now Im quoting my wife some guy of barely legal age to work came out and took photos Well a week and a half later since the very young man took photos Bob left a voice mail stating the estimate was sent You know Bob I appreciate the effort but at this point I kinda started to like my leaking home and the damaged dry wall along with the water damage in my 3 car garage ceiling
5,Jim came here for three days In 90degree heat he worked diligently at scraping and painting the garage When a sudden rainstorm came Jim just waited it out by sitting in his truck We asked him to come inside the house for ice tea during the rain but he preferred to wait in the truck He was very neat polite and pleasant
5,Good he did a great job and provided pointers
4,Getting to the first visit took some time so I gave them an average grade for responsiveness Once the repairman arrived everything went very well He did a very good job and cleaned up well He did the ceiling touch up too
2,I called for a deck repair estimate I received a call from Bob who said Mike would call and set up a time to provide estimate Several days later than stated Mike called back We made an appointment for the estimate He was on time and professional He called back with the numbers and description of work 57 days later When I called and said I wanted to schedule he said he would email a contract Didnt hear from them for weeks Never received contract just another phone call asking if we received the estimate By this time I had contacted someone else and sent in their contract
5,It went amazing they not only did everything we asked they also took initiative and cleaned or suggested ideas not even thought of They really go above and beyond and take their jobs ver seriously I will call them in the future again and again
1,Called twice approx one wek between calls Never did hear back from anyone
2,I dont remember the details or when these people were here  a couple of years ago They came and looked around for our water source We are on a well and have limited water pressure they should have asked about our source of water before they came We would have never ordered the service knowing they would have to use our water i thought they brought their own water in a water truck The job done was most unsatisfactory  I just wanted them to leave before they used up our water Terrible idea to hire this company
1,We have found services elsewhere
2,Three teen girls arrived who looked as though they had been told at gunpoint that they had to clean this house I had talked to a mature sounding woman and thought she would be coming They sped through the two story house in two hours and then told me I owed them for 3 hours because they thought 9 am to 11am was three hours 9 10 and 11 I paid them for the 2 hours from 911 am Someone had set a bathroom cleaner bottle that contained bleach sitting on the hardwood floor in the hall that left bleach marks on the wood Someone who worked upstairs picked up a throwrug without cleaning it and dumped it on a built in bookcase and left it there dirt and all They barely cleaned inside the kitchen cupboards I had left them there to run a few errands and when I came back the whole house smelled like they had spilled a gallon of air freshener throughout the first floor There were one or two ants on the floor due to heavy rains that year so they told me the house was infested Thats a lot of money to pay for some excessive air freshener and 3 surly teens
5,GREAT When I explained to the owner that the front door issue had a safety factor he happily expedited my service call The gentleman that came out was extremely competent and very nicehe handled all my jobs quickly and was professional throughout He cleaned up after himself and did not go overtime as this was 2 big deal coupons The front door issue was particularly tricky and he made it work Will use again THANKS
4,The House Doctors  Bob Vecchio  followed up on our calls and rescheduled the pressure wash He sent two of the nicest young people who spent the time and took the care to do a great job on the house and garage And this was on one of the hottest days when the temperature in the afternoon was in the 90s and probably felt like over 100 In fact I would have understood if House Doctors had called to reschedule on a cooler day just to look out for the safety of their people At any rate they did a super job My husband was especially excited by the job they did pressure washing the back of the garage where some green algae had been creeping up the back wall It looks like new again We are very appreciative
5,Did a very good job power washing front walk and stone path around garden area Courteous and professional Did not call before coming over to do the job luckily I was home
5,They were fine They were very helpful
5,Everything was fantastic Quick reponse from the first phone call  they promptly returned my phone call and scheduled an appointment time within a week Robert arrived on time and promptly knocked out my entire to do list in record time Before finding the The House Doctors on Angies List I had a hard time trying to find anyone to simply return a phone call The House Doctors are now in my speed dial and will be my first call for upcoming house projects I have already shared their information with my friends
1,I purchased a 2hr certificate for Handyman work from the House Doctors on April 27 2013 Called to schedule an appointment the week of June 10th Reached the House Doctor and was given an appointment for June 17 2013 On 617 I received a call from Bob Vecchio stating that his handyman was on his way but en route the truck broke down and he would have to call a tow truck for service He stated he would call me that evening 617 to reschedule However he never called I called back again 618 620 and 624 with no luck of a reply As of this day 78 I have not received a call back to reschedule an appointment or been offered a refund of 8900 for the purchase of the service certificate
1,I needed to have the wood trim around my sliding glass door replaced and also there was a section of the facia board that needed to be replaced as well They came out and did the work things seemed to be fine The wood where it is connected is coming apart and water pours into my home when it rains I contacted the company to come out and fix the issue and left a voicemail I never heard back from them so I called the second number that they have listed and again got no response I have left messages on both numbers now I am needing to have the issue fixed before I can have the exterior of my house painted The wood trim around the door still needs to be stained and painted before the exterior painting can be done
1,I have tried twice to reach them and each time have gotten their answering service but theyve never returned my calls or messages I wont be doing so anymore Im getting a refund
5,Repairs were excellent Good craftsmanship
5,They did a great job The house that they worked on is around 100 years old with a lot of wear and tear throughout Because of the age of the home each time the crew would try to accomplish something they would find further problems below the surface They handled each situation with skill They are very courteous and professional The price was very reasonable considering the amount of work and age of the home Lastly I would like to comment on their ability to get the job done within the time frame stated We would definitely use them again
3,The repair was fine but I was not really happy with the pressure washing They showed up and they were fine The fellow finished it in two hours and my complaint is that I could have done the same with my host He basically just host down my deck
5,i knew if I hired Bob he would come to water the flowers and garden while I was away Of course he did He did not charge me for a weekend when it rained I chose Bob because he is reliable I can count on him
5,Went well The couple that came out were very friendly and professional
5,I had lost faith in all handymen until Bob came to the rescue I have been readying my house to sell This meant doing a number of home improvements most of which were simple enough to tackle myself However when it came to replacing some cracked grout in my ceramic kitchen floor I wanted someone with more expertise and a greater ability to spend all that time crawling around on the floor I called a number of different handymen services Some of them didnt bother to return my calls A couple actually came out to see the job and provided quotes but then wouldnt return calls to schedule the job When I called Bob and explained the situation to him he jumped to action He was very understanding of my time frames and promised that he would not abandon me like the previous companies I had called Bob stayed in contact with me calling me multiple times while he was working to schedule someone to come to my home Within two days we had an appointment scheduled for the following Sunday He called again on Saturday morning to confirm the appointment Later on Saturday I received a call from the actual handyman that was coming to repair my grout Robert Robert asked if it would be possible to stop by that evening to look at the job so he could make sure he had everything he would need the following morning I agreed Once he arrived and assessed the job he provided a quote on the spot We started to talk about the schedule for the following morning When I mentioned that I had a family gettogether to celebrate the return of my nephew he offered to do the job that evening so I would be free for this important family event He left to get his tools and 30 minutes later started working on the grout He removed all the damaged pieces and regrouted the floor Two hours later the floor was done cleaned up as clean as you can make a freshly grouted floor and I couldnt have been happier The job was done less than a week from initially calling Bob and for a price that was better than the two quotes I had received My faith is restored
5,They called me to schedule a datetime and asked in what order I would like things powerwashed so that they made sure to get what I wanted done in the amount of time the Big Deal allowed for The employee arrived on time and checked in with me at intervals to again make sure he did what I wanted in the allotted timeframe Even more was done than I expected and he did a good job I am very pleased with the service received for the price paid
5,It was delayed a couple days but he called me and explained which I appreciated The work was done in a timely manner and the work was very well done
5,The work was done well and professionally This service was scheduled after several phone calls a slight delay apparently because it was a busy time of year for this service The work was done very well and the technician asked questions about what was wanted as needed He even said that there was some time left in the hour we were paying for and was there something else he would like us to do He then cleaned the concrete area near the front door at no extra charge
4,It was an okay experience The second story above my garage could not be reached The rest of the work was fine but I should have been asked beforehand about the second story above the garage
1,they did not show up they do not call back they take the money and run
1,It went terribly First they arrived about 1hr and15 minutes late When I said You guys are late I was expecting you about an hour ago their response was yeah Then I asked them to clean They did a terrible job I continuously had to point out areas that they missed and had to remind them not to take short cuts They didnt even move the rugs I have on my kitchen floor to vacuummop underneath them They kind of work they did was absolutely appalling
5,The work was efficient and professional Work was well done
2,They ended up showing up a month earlier than scheduled They ended up sending a guy out who couldnt do the job that was required He was very courteous and did a good job with the work that he did However I hired the company to wash the high points of my house and they never brought the ladders needed to do that I ended up calling the business to let them know and I still havent heard back in week
5,Responsive to my requests Went well Two workers budgeted their time appropriately Cleaned a stove top hood which required climbing on a ladder countertop which I couldnt do Next time I would specify that i wanted stove top cleaned  which would be time consuming I didnt specifically request it this time so it wasnt done They cleaned my floor meticulously without drenching it in water wood and in several areas one of the workers scrubbed the floor on her hands and knees My knees hurt watching her
4,A few places not done even though I called them to their attention some places not swept that should have been
5,They did a great job The porch and patio look great They offer great value
5,They did an excellent job they were very punctual and professional You name it  its the whole nine yards with this company Id highly recommend them and would use them again for future needs
5,They were there when they said they would come and they did the work they said they would perform I didnt have a lot of interaction with them but it was a fine job and the price was good
5,Matt was on time and did the jobs neatly and quickly Tho I hadnt mentioned the wooden benches there was a little time left and he fixed them I will use them again for a number of different projects I have planned He answered questions I had about those future projects some big and some small
5,I purchased an Angies List Big Deal special offer for this service and they did an excellent job My advice to others is to call them up and get them in Pricewise it was a pretty special deal
5,I was very happy overall with the work completed in 2 hours and for the money paid I wouldnt have believed the difference power washing could make to my deck which was obviously much dirtier than I had anticipated The north facing siding of my home was heavily stained with algae and looks great too though there are a couple of places where some light staining remains It may be that power washing alone can not completely remove stubborn algae stains This is the only reason I gave a B for quality I have chosen not to rate punctuality due to the circumstances at the time The work had originally been scheduled for 512013 but due to a medical emergency within the family the appointment had to be rescheduled I was advised that someone would ring to rearrange within a few days but instead they turned up late afternoon on the 6th and asked if they could do it then Luckily my husband was at home and he agreed This was not a problem for us at all and to be honest was sooner than I had anticipated
5,I rated them A because of the effort they made The initial contact was fine and a date was set for the pressure washing with outside window washing by another company scheduled for 3 days laterwhich had to be rescheduled as well But the pressure washers never showed up Before the scheduled appointment there were about 4 phone messages left asking what was to be done I answered all messages only to get another questioning message a few days later Annoying After waiting for them all afternoon I left them a message that I needed to be rescheduled The office said I would be contacted  A very nice lady returned my call saying they had not come because of an illness and rescheduled the appointment Before the appointed day I got another message from the same person who had made the multiple questioning calls that a crew would be out on yet a different day than the one the lady had scheduled I returned his call and left a message saying his date was wrong and they were expected on the day the woman had set Needless to say they did not show up on the appointed afternoon At about 600 pm I called the office and left a message saying that if I had not already paid for the service I would certainly be cancelling them Since this was the third appointment they had not shown I was not nice About 45 minutes later a very nice 2man crew arrived to pressure wash the house They did an excellent job were courteous and appologized for the lateness of their arrival They said the person who was ill was the scheduler When that scheduler returns to work I hope they give her a raise Apparently she does an excellent job but has no backup They apparently are lost without her The office had called the washing crew at home and sent them to do the house after hours It is for this effort t hat I gave them an A since that was certainly above and beyond what I would have expected
4,I purchased a twohour handyman coupon on 423 I called the company via the phone number on the coupon and left a message on 424 I received one phone call back later on 424 from Mike with a voice mail asking me to call back I returned the call to Mikes phone number that same day made another call to the phone number on the coupon on 428 and sent an email on 513 but I did not receive a response I left a voice mail each time I called the company I requested a refund through Angies List on 517 at which point I provided this review with an initial grade of D After the review was posted I received a phone call from Mike on 525 and a call from Bob on 527 Mikes message indicated that he never received a phone call from me However I double checked my phone bill to ensure that I called the correct phone numbers Bob apologized for the delay and explained there was a medical emergency during the delay He offered to rectify my situation by offering an extra half hour of work I returned Bobs call on 527 and left a message indicating that I would accept his offer if it was not too late in the refund process After speaking to Bob we agreed that it was too late in the refund process to accept Bobs offer However he offered to honor the extra half hour if I purchased a new coupon for the service Following receipt of the refund for the initial coupon Bob and Mike called to get my work scheduled including the extra half hour The work is now scheduled for 614 Jim the handyman called an hour before he was scheduled to arrive on 614 asking to reschedule for the next day I agreed to reschedule and he arrived on time the next day When Jim arrived I showed him the rotted kitchen cabinet floor that I wanted replaced He then went to Home Depot to obtain the supplies using a gift card I had purchased When he returned he went right to work The cabinet now looks great Additionally Jim was pleasant and professional which made for a nice experience Jim finished within two hours so I did not end up using the extra half hour Bob offered
1,Scheduling Before I made an initial call the House Nurses began calling my home and telling my daughter that I had to schedule quickly becasue my offer was going to expire Once I called and left a message calls continued to come to my home instead of the cell phone number I left Since I work during the day I did not get the messages until after close of business I got to the point of leaving a message that I would request a refund and find another company if I did not hear back in 2 daysOnce I was able to contact the company scheduling was easy On the day of scheduled services I called when no one arrived by 30 minutes after the scheduled time No call back so I called again when no one was there an hour after the scheduled time This time I got a call back from the owner advising that the people coming to clean my home were in a car accident We rescheduled for the following Monday This was an inconvenience since I had to then clean on Friday night before weekend guests arrived but you certainly cannot predict a car accident On Monday two workers arrived at 115 pm My daughter was present and kept our dog on a leash in another room with my husband My husband had a stroke and is not very mobile We wanted the cleaners to be able to move freely between the rooms they were cleaning so planned that the master bedroom not be included in the cleaning My daughter called me at about 3 pm and asked if there was anything else I wanted cleaned becasue they were just about done She explained that the ceiling fans would not be cleaned because the cleaners did not bring a ladder I asked my daughter to go over the list with them and make sure they did not forget anything The cleaners left at 330 Whe I arrived home I was looking forward to see a clean home Instead I saw smeared cupboards in my kitchen and waste baskets sitting in the middle of the bathroom floor Light fixtures in the bathroom had not been cleaned or dusted and the doors had not been washedand there were cobwebs in the laundry room and front hall so the walls and ceilings had not been dusted Needless to say I was very disappointed I called the House Nurses the next morning and explained my disappointment Initially the owner said she had a 24 hour guarantee policy and I could get a refund or she could come back and correct the problem I asked her to come back becasue I wanted my house cleaned She called me back a short time later and told me she would not come back unless I paid additional charges She told me that I was not entitled to six hours of cleaningsince two people came to clean and she did not agree that two people working from 115 to 330 was less than six hours of work She told me to write a bad review on Angies list if I wanted to This was surprising because I had never had this kind of reaction I commented on this voicing my surprise that she did not care about negative comments about her business She told me her business was fine and she never gets complaints and that I should just clean my own house It was as though I was speaking to a different person I can understand that someone may not clean to my standards especially if they are willing to complete the work that was paid for but this is no way to treat a customer
4,The work was fine he did a good job He was very quick to respond
5,The faucet was 13 years old and I just could not turn it off I called MrVechio and he sent the plumber out the next day that was the first I was going to be available All went very well
3,On the surface everything looked fine Upon further inspection I realized that bathroom rugs were moped around the shower floor and walls were not clean the ceiling fans were not dusted and there is a wall of mirrors that wasnt cleaned at all I assumed that since cleaning was the job that i didnt have to follow the workers around to make that the job was done properly Additionally I was otherwise occupied I would make it a point to pay closer attention the next time i have house cleaning work performed
5,They did a good job I figure that coming for the very first time you might want to go above and beyond to wow the customer They didnt do this but did exactly what they said they would which is fair
1,I believe the House Doctor is getting too busy and doesnt have the man power to service all the Big deals he is offering I am hoping that some day he will return my call after four failed attempts
4,Overall it went pretty good Had to end up paying over the deal I knew it would be over however I wasnt too happy with the amount of time that it took but they did a decent job The gentleman Mike Rosipko is a great guy
5,We called the House Doctors on Monday May 13 Bob called back to discuss the problem That evening his son called to make an appointment He said they would be near our house the next day so Jim came in the morning and made the repair He was very polite and professional
5,Although I didnt use them because of timing on my part they were very attentive to my needs and will use them in the future
1,The House Doctors sent their employee on 42413 to pressure wash the front walkway and driveway The surfaces were washed while it was raining which made it very difficult to view the quality of thier work Upon inspecting the job a few days later I noticed that they blasted away the top finish of my concrete driveway and front walkway leaving the aggregate surface below I called Mike Vecchio and explained the problem He was unfazed and insisted that the pressure they used would not penetrate paper or cardboard and that the result was normal I pressed further and requested that he inspect the job Mike arrived on May 11th to inspect the job His attitude was poor and dismissive from the starthe further insisted that the result was normal and did not admit to any damage despite that fact that I showed him areas that had not been pressure washed which still had the top concrete surface and compared them with the after effects of their pressure washing job His arrogant attituted shone thorugh again as he insisted that they were blamess Mike did not offer a refund or offer to fix my driveway and walkway surface Ive spoken with real concrete experts and theyve asured me that pressure washing should never remove the smoothe top concrete layer The damage done is permanent It will csot me over 500 to have the top surface sealed as the top surface damage cannot be easily repairedwill cost at least 2000 to have a top coat applied Im beyond unhappythis company is careless and clueless about their pressure washing services Do not use themI may pursure other legal solutions if we cannot reach an agreement
5,The House Nurses LLC answered all my concerns prior to the visit They were punctual I loved that they brought their own cleaning supplies because they knew which cleaner went with which material Their vacuum was the high suction model that I have heard good things about Someone walked in my house UNEXPECTEDLY the next day and first thing she said was Your place looks so clean I wanted everything cleaned sanitized and disinfected but I also wanted everything sparkly Her compliment proved my house looked great Lori is a great listener and I will request their cleaning services again
5,If you have older siding dont expect miracles
3,Overall not well I will have to have someone else come and redue the cleaning
5,This was an overall good experience and we would use House Doctors again for this service
4,Purchased deal for 2 hours of pressure washing Due to volume of business for this deal vendor informed me that they would not be able to schedule service for 12 weeks Requested and received refund Vendor was understanding of this problem
3,I purchased their spring cleaning deal from Angies list They arrived on time and overall did a good job with one big exception When they cleaned the kitchen I specifically asked that the oven be cleaned only to find that after they left and I went to use the oven they had only whipped down the outside This has left me a bit disappointed in the service
5,The work was fine They did what they were supposed to They were pleasant to work with
5,It was an Angies List Big Deal that I purchased I ended up spending an extra 30 because they had to stay a little bit over They were fine It was a really hard job and it was tougher than it appeared at first He had to take extra cuts and measurements on the door hinges in order to get it to work The only thing I didnt like was that it took longer than I anticipated but that was not their fault The doors were extremely heavy The price was in line and probably less than somebody else would have charged They were right on time They were very professional The only drawback is that you need to supply your own materials I had the materials for this project because I was trying to do it myself but for future jobs I might not always know what materials to get I want them to install lattice work with chicken wire but I dont know what to get They will come and do the work but I have to supply everything It would be nice if they would come out and let me know what I need ahead of time
5,The work was adequately done The work they did was great We were very pleased with the work
5,This experience was great and the response time was immediate The young guy that did the work was just great He was very nice and professional He did exactly what I asked for and I was very pleased with the work and the level of professionalism I would use them again and I would recommend them as well
3,The person that they sent to my left me in very concern of whether he was a plumber or not He looked around I had water leaking through my wall He knocked out my wall saw all the water climb down and started to tell me that all of the problem was caused by something in my home Now they leave and tell me they couldnt do anything until I get in touch with the association of my condo I did and call them back to get in touch with me just to see if they would come back to fix my wall I never got a return call
5,Appointment set up was easy Showed upon time Completed work Did not have to be home
5,I was well pleased with the work he did He worked so quickly that I had to find other work to do to make up the 2 hours that I had pruchased
5,t couldnt have gone better and I certainly do recommend them
5,Went very well couldnt have asked for mort I wil definitely use them again
5,Overall the job went well I plan to call on them again for other jobs thankfully I dont need anymore doors hung
5,I love them because they do a great job If they see something that needs to be done they let you know Ive been having bird issues and fixing the roof is part of the solution they proposed Bob the owner really listens to his customers
3,This coupon was a waste of money Angies List did me no services this time around Unfortunately I purchased the coupon in March and it is now almost May and I am still waiting for my two hours of powerwashing First they took almost a week to just call me back after I contacted them with my coupon code When they did call they did not ask me what would be a good time and date they just told me when they would show up Unfortunately they didnt do that either Understandably the weather was iffy that day and some areas had snow However my area did not and it was well above freezing i might have understood but they did not call to cancel I had to contact them and leave a message Almost two hours after they were to appear they finally called back We set a date for the following Saturday Again they did not show up This time the young man who was to perform the service had family health issues However they did not call to cancel and I had to call them and leave a message Over four hours after they were to appear I finally heard from them that they were not coming The owner said that he would call the next evening or following morning Two days later I am still waiting I understand illness weather and set backs What I dont understand is the total lack of professionalism with which this company deals with this Is this the only person who can powerwash in the entire company Angies List I need help here Work was finally done and done well I sincerely hope their issues are now resolved and they will be able to get to their customers in a timely manner Thank you House Doctors for coming through
5,Im n the process of selling my home and wanted all the little settling cracks fixed I bought a big deal for 99 for 3 hours of work The drywall expert sent to my house noticed some cracks that I hadnt even noticed because he knew where to look After he filled the cracks he smoothed the drywall so well that the repair wasnt apparent Then he found the paint that matched each room and touched up the repair for a perfect match
1,She took 48 hours to call me back She then scheduled to come out today which was great She told me that she would be out between 1000 am and 1100 am I called her at about 1148 because they never called me to tell me they were going to be late or anything She told me that she had a family medical issue going on with her daughter I thought it was potentially unprofessional of her to schedule to come out to my house when she had this impending medical issue going on in the first place I decided to get a refund on the deal
3,After sale the owner told me that they do not do roofs So I went for just the siding and patio After 2 hours of cleaning nothing changed except that the patio looked better
5,House Doctors did a very good job Since it did not take the full time to do the house they also did my detached garage The house looks much better
5,The total experience was amazing I hope that I will be able to secure a place on The House Nurses schedule for biweekly maintenance cleaning I would also like to mention The House Nurses superior customer service First of all The House Nurses initiated contact the day after I purchased the Big Deal All communication was extremely polite and professional My personal preference was considered of utmost importance in selecting the date and time of the appointment I then received a call to confirm the appointment on the evening before the date of the appointment On the morning of the appointment I received a call from Laurie stating that the cleaner scheduled to clean my house was ill Would it be possible to reschedule for the following day I explained that although I am usually flexible I had already stripped my bed and my husband and I are both physically unable to lift the mattress in order to remake the bed Laurie then assured me that my housecleaning would take place that afternoon At 1100 AM Laurie called to inform me that she was on her way Laurie and her assistant arrived before 1130 AM just one half hour later than originally scheduled Superior CleaningSuperior Customer ServiceThe House Nurses A
1,We called this provider several times We were given a quote over the phone for 550000 to get our two bathrooms remodeled We asked to have the quote in paper It has been 23 weeks since that phone call with no quote in writing or follow up We are tired of waiting on this provider and seeking to take our business elsewhere
5,We purchased an Angies List deal for two hours of handyman work and were very pleased We had two overhead light fixtures in the kitchen that needed to be replaced The ceiling was very tall and the lights had not been installed correctly from the beginning so it made things a little more complicated We also wanted them to install a new fan in the bedroom Nothing was easy with the kitchen lights so when the two hours were up the fan had not been installed The worker stopped and gave us the option of whether we wanted him to stop or continue and we would be billed for the time it took to finish the job Because his work thus far had been such a good quality and the price to continue was very fair  we opted to have him finish the job The handyman Michael Rosipko was great The fact that it took longer than we had originally expected was due to the improper way the lights were originally installed Michael worked very hard and fixed the problems correctly rather than just hurrying to finish the job He was pleasant and very professional We could not have been more pleased and will not hesitate to use their services again It was so nice to have someone that wanted to do the job right Michael was that guy
5,Jim arrived on time and did pretty much everything that I needed done Although I bought a discount couponf from Angies list for their services they didnt make me feel like I was getting less serice JIm just went from one project to another Very efficient and I am very happy
5,Great job arrived on time and required no supervision Work looks great
5,The work was done in a professional manner The workers were punctual carefully moved and covered the furniture as needed when painting and cleaned up the debris generated by the work
1,Never returned after two visits to give estimate for siding and door threshold repair
5,I was pleased that they were able to schedule me as quickly as they did Mike R was extremely courteous and went above and beyond to explain the best way to remove the mirror tiles and improve the overall appearance of the wall He and Mark were able to finish the job quickly and were very careful to ensure there was no mess once they were done I really appreciate their time and effort on this project
5,Handyman Michael Rosipto arrived right on schedule and removed his boots at my front door I showed him the materials I had bought for the jobs screen spine and weatherseal and he went right to work The work was pretty straightforward except for the kitchen door leading into the patio room It had never closed completely right because the deadbolt was misaligned by a fraction of an inch I just asked Mike to replace the weatherseal but I heard his electric screwdriver from the other room I was pleasanty surprised to see he made the deadbolt align properly The door now closes better than it has for twelve years He also gave me some ideas for some other little problems that have been bugging me Overall a good experience
5,Overall I was satisfied with the service provided The service provider was very punctual Because I was unable to be there for her service visit I left a list per level of areas I wanted addressed I appreciated the attention to detail shown to the second and main levels of my home It appeared as though the lower level went lacking and perhaps this was due to running out of time I would absolutely use this company again and recommend their service to others
4,For spring cleaning my expectations were rather high The woman who made my appointment was very courteous and professional Two very nice women arrived punctually with their own cleaning supplies They needed no direction and were in my home less than 2000 sq ft for 3 hours each total 6 hours They did the basics  dusting vacuuming scrubbed floors cleaned 112 bathrooms Although they did this well I was expecting them to also do small things like dust picture frames clean a vanity mirror in bath and a cabinet top in the living room It was worth 99 but I would not have paid the regular 159 for this service I would have tipped them if I thought they did more than the bare minimum
5,the above paragraphs explain the process
5,Everything was great and we had no complaints
5,They did ia very good job I was very pleased
1,They couldnt be bothered to even return phone calls
5,Jim arrived on time and worked efficiently every minute of the 2 hours purchased His workmanship installing the crown molding in my kitchen is precise and professional with NO waste of materials There was a lot of cut work and every angle was cut and nailed with precision Jim was polite and worked quietly the entire time he was in my home He cleaned up EVERYTHING prior to leaving I am palnning to remodel my basement this summer and put in a family room My hopes are to have Jim return to do the work Thank you for a pleasant experience Jim was expected at 1000 am and called well in advance to let me know of an emergency family situation that would require coming later He politely asked if it would cause problems for me
5,The House Doctors responded quickly and came in the evening to accommodate our schedules It was another excellent experience The electrician was friendly and professional The work was completed quickly and he cleaned up after himself You cannot go wrong with The House Doctors
5,Id had House Doctors work for me before with a great experience at that point they redid my closet installed a lot of cabinets and fixed some rotted woodwork in an exterior window When I bought the Angies List deal this past week I got a phone call within 24 hours letting me know of a cancellation for the next day When Jim came out that next day he got right to work did a great job on all the little jobs I needed to get done He was very professional and had good ideas on how to get things done Id recommend Jim and House Doctors to anyone
4,From the first calling to set up an estimate to the job comlete it was good They called to let us know they were on he way and were on time as were the phone calls They stayed on the job ate on the job and all clean up was good This work was done on Dads house approx 03232010 House has been sold and I dont remember all the specifics For the work they did for us I would use them again

5,Cannot sing their praises enoughVERY RESPONSIVE Arrived right on schedule extremely professional in every single way They got the work done fast and not a scrap left in the yard actually cleaner than when they arrived What a great team so friendly and considerate in every single way Use this provider I highly recommend
2,I had an appointment for a Saturday afternoon He was late so I called and was advised that he had forgotten to write the appointment down in his book He did arrive a short time later I provided all the materials for him to spray the bathtub The paint was white but the tub looks yellow Im not sure but Im thinking he did not shake the paint can long enough I could have replaced the tub for what it cost me to have it painted however I had all the materials to paint it He did not complete cleaning up the area as well There was a my bucket left with water and a rag and there was masking tape left on the faucet as well The invoice was for 2500 more than he quoted however I did not pay him the additonal 2500
1,I called and emailed multiple times without any response I decided to get a refund from Angies List
5,She came on time started immediately and left everything immaculate
5,Excellent experience The guys are very friendly and navigated tough stairs and impossible angles to take out the old water heater and put in a bigger 75 gallon heater They were prompt professional friendly and cleaned up after themselves It could not have gone better I would and have used them for an array of household projects These guys are the best and had to be very patient because I was traveling so much I appreciate all that they do and they are well worth the money
5,He arrived promptly was courteous and professional and did a good jobBased on this experience I would hire this company again
5,The drywaller from The House Doctors came out to our house for two days at the scheduled time He was very pleasant and we were impressed that hes done work for The Historical Society having been trained by an oldtimer His work was great  youd never know it had been done which as he pointed out to us is exactly what you want
1,Never got past phone calls I left a detailed message with my phone number Did not hear anything for 3 days I called them and some guy answered the phone with just a hello  never identified the company or himself I asked if this was the House Doctor and he said yes but seemed confused on the Big Deal offer At that point I said I didnt have a good feeling and would go elsewhere I also said he might get a bad report He said do what you have to do and hung up Very crude individual very unprofessional
1,I contacted House Doctor after purchasing Big Deal by phone I left a detailed message with a return number two times Three days went by with no reply I called again and some guy answered the phone with just hello I asked if this was the House Doctor and he said yes I asked why he answered with just a hello versus identifying the business He ignored the question and wanted to know my name I told him I was calling about the Angies Big Deal and he seemed not to know what I was referring to at first At that point I told him if thats the way he runs his business Id rather go somewhere else and that he might get a bad review at which point he said Do what youve got to do and hung up
4,Teh did take a few days to get back to me I wanted to have some faucets installed and a couple of odd jobs completed They informed me that they do not do faucet work so I decided to get a refund
5,Began work on Wed and completed work on Friday Did a very nice job and cleaned up afterwards
5,Had a bit of a slow start with a delay in coming to view the job but once that was done everything went well The workman was very polite neat and I really appreciated that he did not makereceive cell phone calls while he was here He focused on the job at hand and was finished in about three hours

2,I did not hire them because the rates are very high 174 for first hour and 124 for each hour after that and can be billed in 15 minutes increments They also charge by the hour to shop for your supplies and the is a mark up charge Also they dont come out to do free estimates you have to send them pictures I would recommend
5,Rich was terrific He was going to be slightly delayed so I received a call from the office with an update before he was scheduled to be here which I appreciated Rich was amiable and knowledgeable and he made sure to get my inputapproval before making any decisions He was careful but efficient and didnt take longer than necessary The work actually took less time than the estimate I would definitely hire again
5,Jay was amazing he had to return to finish the job My building had someone moving out and would not let us use the freight elevator  Granted I did not know that their would be a need for itso I had to reschedule the work The building can be very difficult for contractors not on the buildings preferred list Jay did an amazing job on the doors even with constraints that were out of his control The job was much better than I expectedvery pleased I will be requesting Jay for the installation of a tub  shower doorI have been using numerous contractors for renovation of our badly outdated Condo it has been one nightmare after another Mr Handyman is so easy to work with Scheduling is so easy  She is really positive  professional  I should know her name but it escapes me I If I had only known what an amazing job they do  I would have used them more for projects I have already contractedMr Handyman does a professional job at very competitive pricing

5,Would definitely use again A very customer oriented company Very responsive when you call Easy to schedule and liked the flexibility when I had a conflict The serviceman was on time professional and did a beautiful job
2,First of all i pulled up in my parking lot after going to Lowes to get the caulk  spray paint He was sitting in his van So I stayed outside of my condo bldg  checked my mailbox  looked back again  he was still just sittinng in his van Mind you he was already ten min late So i went back  started to walk to his van  he got out  said r u Mary i said yes  he said he had trouble finding my bldg So when we got inside i asked him when does the clock start when he pulls up or when he actually starts the work He said when he first pulls up So now im like 20 min in the hole without him even starting any work He worked very slowly Then he said he needed to go out to his truck to get something He stayed outside for another 15 min or so I didnt even see him bring anything in with him Now the price we negotiated at the beginning of the deal he said he charges 17600 for one hour I did agree to that He did finally finish the task but the caulking on the sink was sloppy  he left one corner of the mirror untouched He then asked me if he could have the brand new bottle of caulk  spray paint i had just purchased from the store I said no i may need it But what kind of contractor comes to do a job caulking a sink  doesnt have caulk with him He didnt think i would have any  then he would have to spend an extraordinary amount of time visiting the hardware store to purchase some  the clock would still be running on my dime I asked him if he had any caulk in hi truck  he said no He also assured me he would get the job done within 1 hour so i dont have to spend extra for more time But of course he only did abt 30 min worth of actual work  the rest of the time he was sitting in his van or going out to his van to retrieve something but i didnt see anything he brought back in So in the end i ended up paying 23600 for 30 min of work to caulk a smsall sink  toilet  spray paint the bottom of a mirror Even though they may have been a little high i did agree to pay the 17600 for an hour but i feel like i was taken advantage of because i am a woman or maybe its just the way they do business i should get a refund of extra 6000 because there was not even enough work to do to take up all that time He used the time piddling  paddling along just trying to waste time so he could keep the clock running  get paid more Id like a refund  wont do business with you again or refer any friends or relatives until this is made right
5,Installation went well and looks great
5,Friendly service man provided excellent service He definitely knows what he is doing and got the job done right in an expeditious manner I was also able to quickly and easily make an appointment over the telephone This company will be first go to the next time I am in need of a household repair
5,It went well The door was fixed as well as the door knob The door frame was also touched up with paint
5,This is the third time I have used Mr Handyman and again we are very pleased with the service Their technician Butch arrived on time and completed the job in less than an hour Will definitely use them again
5,the job went very smooth the work was done in a timely fashion and very fair price This is a job that I could not have gotten to due myself and I was glad Mr Handyman of Northern Balto County could assist with this project
5,I highly recommend this company The technician did an excellent job on my rental property and was very professional I will definitely call on them again in the future for my rental property

5,Technician was awesome Arrived on time worked diligently while he saw there Looks great Great value will definitely use them again
1,Stated that they do not do so work only 29 minutes away from their office Found this very curious response
5,Very professional Easy to schedule woth office staff Great communication by all staff Punctual You get a quality job
5,They were very punctual and completed the job within allotted time with no issues
5,Light pole base had rusted away and lamp needed to be leveled and secured Mr Handymans Technician Butch dug the surrounding area and leveled and secured the lamp with concrete mix Job took less than 2 hrs and we are pleased with the result
5,Received an estimate via email Office called to tell me Technician was enroute Tech arrived on time obtained materials and completed the job in a very professional manner Finished product looks great I will hire them again
5,It went great The company is well run I had specific instructions for when the job should start and they followed through with it Excellent office staff We have our hut that we put up each year at the end of the summer For several years we were using Dick from this company to put it up Months before he was going to retire they sent out Donalong with Dick at no extra charge to show him the ins and outs of putting up the hut I thought this was going above and beyond Yesterday Don showed up and did a nice job he had a shoulder injury so the owner Mark came to help him out They were both outstanding gentleman I am very happy to recommend this great company
5,All the work was done very well and within the estimated time and costs Both my wife and I are very pleased with the outcome of the work and certainly would hire this company again for any future work
5,Well will be back to repair fountain
4,It went very well Rich did a great job Other than installing the installing the water lines backwards hot water and cold water is on the wrong side it went well Unfortunately it will cost me in order for them to come out to correct his error Because it took longer than expected and we went over budget we cant afford to pay them to correct this issue at this time We will have to continue at a later date I have recommended them to neighbors and friends They are reputable company that will always show up Thats very rare these days
5,Doug arrived when promised and quickly replaced what amounted to a broken water line Total cost 164 for time and visit
5,I wasnt sure what was causing my baseboard to discolor and disintegrate  worried it was a pipe leak Mr Weis arrived on time was very friendlyprofessional diagnosed the issue quickly  ants were eating the molding I was able to get rid of the ants behind the wall and he replaced the molding and caulking quickly efficiently and professionally My experience with Mr Handyman was extremely pleasant  I highly recommend them
5,I had a pocket door that would not slide back into the wall Rich took time to assess the issue and came up with a minimally invasive solution that maintained the integrity of these 100 year old doors The work was complete within 4 hours including removing trim reapplying the door putting the trim back and repainting Everything was cleaned upon completion I am extremely pleased and would recommend Rich for special repairs on older homes
5,This is the second time I have used this company My scores tell you pretty much everything My only complaint is the cost but they are responsive prompt professional reliable etc They do good work Some advice I did save money by finding purchasing and picking up the fan myself because they would have charged for that
5,Very professional and work was of great quality Definitely helped to clear up a good portion of our evergrowing chore list The way they structure their rates it is definitely worthwhile to compile a list of items and have them done all at the same time versus having them come out to complete a single task each time the first hour of service is more expensive than each subsequent hour
5,Me Handyman did a great job fixing a disconnected dryer vent located behind my kitchen cabinet The work was completed quickly I have not had any issues since I would use their services again
5,The technician arrived right on time and worked diligently while he was there He was very efficient and did a great job Would definitely use Mr Handyman again
5,Doug was a true professional The quality of the work was excellent
5,A very Customer service oriented company from scheduling to arriving on time Technicians are professional and do a great job I prefer to have licensed workers and guaranteed work
1,I purchased a gift certificate for a relative for 15000 The individual from the company did perform the service They were prompt However the minimum charge for an hour was 15000 This was not disclosed upfront to the relative When I called to express my concern about that the price for one hour of services given the actual work took less than 20 minutes the representative told me that this was my relatives error and actually used the expression buyer beware Wow This was after interrupting me and telling me that I was telling them that the company wouldnt get paid because Id purchased an Angies List gift certificate I actually purchased a gift certificate from them directly so that entire portion of the conversation was irrelevant Had the representative not interrupted me or had actually been listening she wouldnt wasted my time going down a rabbit hole Additionally the representative mentioned that they decided to honor the certificate even though there was also a problem with the certificate number The gift certificate came DIRECTLY FROM THEIR COMPANY I got it from their website If there were any issues with the number those issues belong to Mr Handyman Up until this point I had enormous confidence in the companies lately highly on Angies List That ended today
5,Butch arrived on time examined the area then he explained what he needed to do and answered my questions He went about the job and finished fairly quickly The area looks great and my husband is quite satisfied and so am I
5,I am VERY satisfied This was worth every penny Excellent work and professionalism Thank you Mr Handyman and Rich
4,I believe he reinstalled them better than they were installed initially They are very secure and have given me no trouble since
5,very professional repeat trip to accommodate neighbor
5,Great Provider worked in driving rain to make repairs to the corner of our house and protect it from the elements
5,Wonderful If only our insurance company had been as responsive as the handyman They also hung our tv on the wall the same day they did the siding We will use for all future projects Price noted included all materials and he found matching siding for our old house
5,It went great He is fast and polite
5,Great Experience The gentlemen was on time he explained everything perfectlyvery personable and professional I will be using this company in the near future for other projects
5,Jay did an excellent job as this was a complicated task PVC Deck boards had to be pulled up so he could access the bottom of the window Everything was put back together nicely Trim was added that made it look better than the original
5,Better experience than the handy app No complaints at all
4,Deck looks good Only issue was the time needed to complete the job was really underestimated The company did provide some compensation
5,They cleaned it out and all is working well
5,Better than anticipated From scheduling with Lynn to having Wade perform the work we couldnt be more pleased Well worth the price Everyone was sincere professional and easy to work with
5,I forget exactly what we had done aside from some drywall repairs for minor water damage but our handyman was excellent seams were invisible He also noticed some worn corners in a few hallways and fixed them up so theyre nice and square again Would not hesitate to call them again
5,Excellent From the initial call to set everything up to the technician finishing the job was a great experience Will definitely be using them again
5,I called the company and the young lady was very helpful She explained the service that could be done how much it approximately would be and worked very hard to get a service person out as soon as possible When there was a cancellation she called with a possible earlier appointment Very good customer service Don arrived early and was ready to work He was very pleasant and listened to my desires He was very professional I was very comfortable with his knowledge and ability to get the job done He completed one job and went right into the next I would definitely use this company and its service again
5,Mr Handyman and specifically Jerimiah couldnt have been more professional or done a better job We are completely satisfied
4,Mr Handyman Dick arrived about 10 minutes late which wasnt a problem He was very professional and polite My issue isnt with the services provided but the estimate and perhaps the type of work not the handymans fault but the saleswoman The cost is 154 the first hour and 104 each additional hour in 15 minute segments I provided photos of the workspace as well as measurements I stated there were 6 large sections and two smaller sections but the handy did not receive the correct work statement before arriving The salesman estimated the work based on measurements and photos to take 34 hours It took over 5 hours and that was with my husband helping and us doing some of the cleanup afterwards Materials provided cost 140 so the total for labor and materials came out to 710 It was about twice what I expected to pay to have the work done I thought the work would include a tracked screen system or something but it was cut and stapled screen and the trim when replaced hid the seems and work Thats not the handymans fault either and I should have requested something specific if I wanted it We also have to patch all the nail holes now and do the touchup paint job The end result was a very nicelooking screen but at an exorbitant price for a lessthanpolished final product
5,The cost depends on how long it is going to take They have been good at responsiveness They have been on time They are very professional They came out very quickly after I called looked it over and gave me some ideas of what they were going to do Two people came out and they are very nice friendly and know what they are doing
5,He was punctual and professional All work was very well done He cleaned up all project work He was personable and expert The one thing i would have changed would have been to identify ahead of time exactly what items he might have needed as he had to go out to get some things which i did not have on hand
5,Our handyman Jeremiah I believe was great Very knowledgeable capable and a nice guy too
5,The stuff seems to have gotten done Theyre really quick They had to reschedule sometimes but I dont think thats the same as being late One of the things that stood out is that they have the appropriate license for the work that they are doing Because prior to using them I had used some people that I had gotten through a different set of recommendations not through Angies List and that particular provider wandered off with a fair chunk of cash not doing the work that they were supposed to have done Thats sort of why Angies List is so important
5,I would use again in a heart beat The price was reasonable and work was done much more quickly than I expected Also I appreciated that my house was left very clean after substantial dust was created
5,It went great Mark was very professional on the phone He was able to send one of his workers out a day or two later to look at the jobs and provide an estimate His price was as good as or a little cheaper than a couple other estimates I got The shed floor turned out great Regarding the drywall they went to the trouble of waiting for the spackle to dry and came back the next day to sand it Per my instructions they left it like that for me to paint When I applied the primer some of the spackle in one area came off I explained the problem to Mark He said he never heard of this type of thing happening He sent someone over who redid the spackle and even applied primer to the redone area all at no extra charge I was then able to paint with no problem
5,Very professional and on time Very good
5,The price was pretty good It was very urgent and I inquired from a bunch of companies who didnt have time They were able to send out a guy rather quickly and got the work done The settlement happened on time so they were very good When you call them up they give you a time slot rather quickly and the quality of the work was good The work passed the inspection I think for the small job that I hired them to do they were very good
5,Well pleased he got the job done in good time Very courteous
5,Great Job Well pleasedTech Don was courteouswent right to work and cleaned up afterwardsVery efficient
5,Well came on timeremoved doortook it to shopfixed
5,Wade was on time and so professional very pleased with all the work he did Lynn was also very helpful and patient with all my questions
1,If you have a smaller project or projects dont waste your time calling They asked what types of things I needed done I provided an exhaustive list of small projects as examples but said they didnt all need to be done at once and I was most concerned about getting 34 outside things done before it got cold He asked what the prior people who failed to show up to complete a job charged and when I told him he replied You dont want me because we charge way more than that I told him my primary concern was getting a professional who could do the job properly and show up when they said they would He spent the entire time on the phone trying to talk me out of hiring them because of their price and then finally reluctantly offered me a full day for 818 over a month away
5,Wade was a true pleasure to have in our house the exact kind of person you have complete trust in and feel comfortable leaving in your house He showed up on time and ready to work The first task was hanging a complicated crystal chandelier with a lot of crystals My kids were so excited that they monitored everything he did I really appreciated how professionally and kindly he dealt with them and when appropriate he even let them help My wife was equally impressed Wade did all of the tasks professionally and efficiently We could not have been more pleased If you are thinking of hiring a handyman do yourself a favor and ask for Wade
5,Excellent No other way to describe it On time quality work the controlled mess was cleaned up and a reasonable price I had two holes in my ceiling from a leak above me Jeremiah Ill call him the artist cut to the drywall to the odd shape of one of the holes I was a bit apprehensive about hiring someone on an hourly bases I was thinking the job would be needlessly prolonged but it wasnt I was very very happy Jeremiah was friendly and very professional I will definitely call them again Im an exRealtor so have worked with many contractors over the years These guys are one of the best The job took close to 5hrs
1,When I contacted them to tell them the delivery date I was told it would be 7 days before they could get someone to come out to install the door I explained to them I has no where to store the door for 7 day since its prehung with sidelites The didnt seem to care the least I wont do business with them again Not to mention they charged me 14600 just to do the measuring and that was suppose to be applied to the cost for installing the door
5,Painless Absolutely painless Prompt courteous and efficient
5,He was running a little late arrived 45 minutes past the 2 hour window but did call to let me know Did services very efficiently
5,Mr White has done work in my home before He does a very good job
5,I was impressed with the provider from the first phone call Alan knew right away that they could help anticipated my questions about insurance and rates before I could even ask and explained the limitations of service upfront On the day of service Dick was on time friendly and VERY knowledgeable of what needed to be done He knew what caulking needed to be totally replaced and what ones just needed spot fixes all done appropriately He worked efficiently and his work was much better than my husband or I could have done I will definitely be calling them again for other jobs
5,I originally submitted an online inquiry on the providers website but hadnt heard back after 2 or 3 weeks Because of the reviews here I decided to give Mr Handyman another shot and called directly The person who answered Im terrible with names was very apologetic about the online inquiry issue I explained what I needed I only had a rough idea since there were so many little odd jobs like hanging a few pictures switching out some light bulbs tightening some fixtures etc and I was told exactly what they did and did not provide turns out almost everything I needed they could do except deal with a minor plumbing issue The person on the phone was knowledgeable about the services answered all of my questions and did not simply punt my technical questions to the tech who would be coming I was able to get an appointment for the next morning and was given a 2 hour time window I got a 15 minute call ahead and the tech arrived on time as promised We walked through the house and I explained everything I needed He got to work right away was extremely professional and friendly and was accommodating when I added a few small things in the middle of the job that I had forgotten when we did the walk through He was also able to answer questions about other services the company provides while he was working I asked if they do furniture assembly and if he could haul away a few pieces of furniture he was disassembling One stand out for me was that I was sure I would need to replace a screen door because my dog ran through it and I just needed to know what to order or have Mr Handyman order and install it but instead of going to the expense the tech said he could repair it which he did at the appointment The hourly rate and the fee for the hauling I found to be extremely reasonable for the overall professionalism and quality of the work The tech worked very efficiently I would definitely use this company again once I have a few things piled up on my list the flat fee of 146 for the first hour seems a little steep if you only have one small thing that needs to be done
5,Initial Contact made via this site and prompt return call Scheduling went well and they truly worked with me to fit into my day Wade was on time assessed the jobs to be done and went about them efficiently and thoroughly I will definitely use them in the future
5,great first time I had used them and was starting small will be making a bigger list now to use again pleasant professional  very happy
5,Ken called to let me know when to expect Don He arrived right on time reviewed everything that needed to be doneI added some things originally it was to just hang the TV Then Don got right to work Neat clean efficient and personable We couldnt be more pleased Will definitely call again and recommend others
5,no drama all went very well
5,We were very pleased I called Monday morning and scheduled the visit for Tuesday After discussing whether they could paint the wood the trim was on the second level of our house Ken moved it back a day to give us time to get the paint Scheduling was very easy and professional Handyman did arrive on the date scheduled I had left the office a message that I would be in a training all day and to call my wife if any issues They actually listened to the message and called her to give her an update The repair work looks great They confirmed when they were done and sent us the receipt by tomorrow morning We would definitely use them again The only hiccup we encountered is that we were told we didnt have to be home to have the work done so neither of us took off of work However they didnt tell us that they would need access to electricity until they called that morning when they realized it was a problem Thankfully our neighbor let them use theirs but a heads up about that would have been good
5,The handyman arrived promptly and tackled the varied task list without any issues He let me know when we needed a specialist window repairs and handled the rest in good time The rates are a tad pricy but the service was worth it for the short timeframe in which I needed to have the work done
5,Came same day Great communication from dispatch Worked quickly and did a fine job for reasonable price
5,Ive had this company do work for me twice in the past year and the people who have come have been very capable professional friendly and willing to do even the simplest tasks Theyve also been honest in telling me when a task is not one they can do which I appreciate
5,It went very well I was called a half hour before they came just to give me a heads up The gentleman was very courteous quiet just came in and did the work I asked He was really efficient And they man who answers the phone when you call to schwduleAllen also called back after the work was done to make sure everything went well and I was okay with all the work the handyman completed The whole process was wonderful From scheduling they were very polite and accommodating to my scheduling needs
5,Cant say enough good about them Fast efficient and extremely high quality You might find others that will cut corners and come in slightly cheaper but youll pay more in the long run because the quality will likely not be as good
5,Dick our handyman was on point I told him the issues and he got right to work He fixed all issues we had He explained everything he did and gave me advice for maintaining the door I only wish I had more for him Ill be creating that list and contacting Mr Handyman again They also followed up with a phone call to make sure service went well
5,They were prompt courteous professional and completed the job as well as expected
5,Overall they did a good job and were at the home for around an hour
5,Don came out and diagnosed the problem as some light mold in spots and blistering paint in multiple other spots  an 8 X 11 foot area He went out to purchase some materials to fix my problem When he returned he taped plastic to all of the walls in the area he would be working Put down drop cloths to cover the furniture and carpet He sprayed the mold with a mold control product after scraping off the mold and blisters He examined the ceiling for soft spots and weaknesses that could cause problems later he found none He plastered the spots that appeared uneven after he finished scraping Since the plaster was going to take a while to dry He asked if I wanted to sand the plaster or have him come back and do it I chose to have him come back He cleaned up all the protective gear he used On his return he repeated protecting the furniture and carpet with plastic He sanded down any uneven spots and cleaned up after himself He told me to get Kiltz primer to prevent any repeat of the mold showing up again And to go into the attic and spray any visible signs of mold with a Mold Control product to kill any activity there Don is personable and a fountain of very useful information that he shared freely When I asked what else his company did he gave me a flier stating all there service categories by room Will I use him again You bet your A
5,I have been very pleased with them and I used them twice The first time the gentleman was here the whole day He came in at 8 and left at 5 oclock and it was almost a 1000 But he addressed all the issues that I originally had him come in for He fixed the leaky faucets in the bathroom he fixed loose stair barristers we needed some grouting in one of the showers he fixed some light fixtures and lot of little odds and ends They were very punctual and utilized their time really well I was afraid of paying somebody on an hourly rate for work but these gentlemen were very good There was never a down time You never felt like that he was sitting around talking on his phone and he was really not working I was at home the whole time and following them around
5,It went very well I only wish the rate was better The service though was very good
5,They were absolutely terrific The guy was thorough and did a great job washing the house They were also timely and pleasant
3,It went well There are just extra costs that I am unhappy
5,He is very expensive but he is a very reliable provider on the list
5,My husband and I were amazed at how quickly the work was completed and the quality of work Very professional We will definitely call Mr Handyman the next time we need work done around the house
5,They did a really good job They were a little pricey but I am very happy with the service that I got
5,I was impressed by the fact that Jeremiah didnt only replace the drywall tape but explained to me his concerns before thoroughly investigated why it was peeling off He did such a great job of retaping the area and spackling it that it doesnt need to be painted The patch he did where he removed the smoke detector is almost invisible even before it is painted He also took great care in getting rid of the rusted nails in the mortar without damaging the brick and after inspecting my storm door explained why it was hard to open at times Jeremiah knows his trade was very pleasant to work with and did a great job cleaning up as he went along
2,First on their website they quoted a free estimate he got to the job he told me everything that Ive told him on the phone about the sump pump then he had to go to Home Depot to get it and I didnt realize that I was being charged for that time They charge 146 to come out and 96 every 15 minutes which was not told to me until I got ready to pay for it then Ill call their office and the person that answered the phone said said if I wanted a cheapest service I shouldve called someone else I did tell him that I had called BGE home and they quoted me 90 per hour to come out and I thought that they would be cheaper
5,Superior service knowledgable tech They got the Job done fast and the work was perfect Will use again
5,I called to make an appointment was treated politely and quoted the hourly rate Owner assessed my job and accurately stated it should take no more than a 12 hour which it did exactly He stated the cost for the job and then we agreed on a date I did not have to wait a long time for the appointment date to be made The old wireless doorbell box was removed requiring screw drivers etc and new one put in its place Battery operated so new batteries installed Chime level and music was set then the box was covered actually the trickiest part Then new doorbell push button installed on outside door frame  Required screwing in screws and then attaching cover Mr Handyman was due between 1012 AM and was at my doorstep exactly at 10 He was very polite and personable answered all of my questions and offered some information about changing the push button battery Would definitely use this company again
5,The cuts were clean the doors swing perfectly and no damage of any kind was done They were very punctual and responsive
5,I have used Mr Handyman of Northern Baltimore County for years on a wide variety of jobs indoor and outdoor large and small They do excellent work for a reasonable charge and respond quickly when called The owner Ken Dunn is accessible and fair The handymen are very skilled polite and efficient I am very satisfied with their work and will use them again in the future for big and small jobs
5,They showed up on time They fixed everything in a timely fashion Id definitely use this company again
5,Theyre great I spent about 134 Everything that they did I liked We had a book shelf that didnt have a back to it and he put a back on it and he installed a couple overhead ceiling fans and he also put in a sump pump
5,The repairman was on time He quickly assessed the requirements of the the situation and was very efficient It was my first time using Angies List to find a repairman It was an excellent experience
5,He arrived on time After I explained what was required he went right to work and methodically completed all the tasks and the final outcomes all were excellent He was very pleasant and great conversationalist as well I was 100 pleased with the experience and definitely will call Mr Handyman again when I have repairs or improvements that are needed
5,Work was performed on time and at the price quoted Area was cleaned when work was completed and to satisfaction
5,My experience with them is good They were professional friendly and knowledgeable
2,The call center took down all my information including a description of the work I needed which was drywall repairreplacement and laminate flooring installation The local rep called me back and said they dont do that work when in fact that work is listed on their website of services provided Guess they just dont want my money
5,Very professional Jeremiah was on time very competent and both pleasant and polite Very well done I would definitely use them again
5,Jeremiah arrived 15 mins early We went over the items on the To Do list and he had helpful suggestions regarding an outside tap and the electrical outlet He quickly cleaned out the gutters before going to purchase additional materials This took a little longer than anticipated as he had been unable to find the materials he is accustomed to using and had to make another stop and search a bit for a suitable alternative He had receipts for everything and gave me the option of using the materials he had selected or not As it happened they were all perfectly suitable he had given consideration to his selections He moved through the tasks quickly and efficiently and explained everything as he went along I left him to finish the work and before I got home he had already finished and called me with an update on his time and the total cost Everything looked good when I got back
5,He was on time and was work was very neat and clean However after he left I did discover one picture that he forgot to hang in my office Maybe I should have turned it around and pulled it out so he wouldve remembered He caulked my basement bathroom entry hung mirros my awards curtain rods changed the light bulb on my back porch and he mounted the hose reel to my house I scheduled him for two hours Hes very professional
3,Weather played a major issue in the completion of this job however the first day I was scheduled for work they cancelled on me an hour before The overall quality of the work was not the quality I would have expected from what I paid I ended up having to touch up the paint myself In part this was due to the fact that I was not there to supervise myself They never came at the time we had set up either arriving early or changing at the last minute to not coming due to weather This made me feel less than comfortable considering I was paying by the hour There was also much confusion as to what I actually wanted done which is in part due to the fact that even though I took off work on three separate occasions I was never able to actually meet the person doing the work While I was offered a small discount for the inconvenience I will not be using this company again
5,Mr Handyman went fine The job went well They came when they said then they did a good job
5,Late Thursday I needed a rental unit fixed up on Memorial Day weekend I fortunately had signed up for Angie List and had used them in past with great results Well Mr Handyman owner Alan could not have been nicer He had a man at my place Saturday at 9am and the work was completed in 2 hours Paid via credit card and reciept emailed to me Thanks
5,Very pleased Excellent job from scheduling to clean up
5,Scheduling an appointment via telephone was easy and I received email and telephone confirmations Jeremiah arrived on time was very friendly and professional and performed an excellent job Would highly recommend and will use their services again
5,Scheduling the appointment was easy Don the technician came on time and did the work promised and later added efficiently Spent a total of 3 hrs 15 mts He was very professional and advised on a couple other items as well
5,I called on Thursday 515 at noon and I was able to set an appointment the next day at 800AM I was very surprised at how quick I was able to get the job scheduled Contractor arrived on time in uniform with company truck I explained the job of removing attic stairs and installing new stairs I had bought a set of stairs that was too small but he was able to frame it in and make it work All in all the job took a little under four hours The stairs he installed worked perfectly The finishing work ie trim and plaster to cover holes was good but not exceptional I would highly recommend this company and I would use them again
5,Great service excellent work wonderful responsiveness
4,Several different workers There was a variance of work quality
5,Jeremiah arrived on the job early and was ready to work I walked him through all the projects and then we talked about pricing He was very skilled and all the work was completed looks great This company is expensive but I think you get what you pay for
5,Excellent job Looks like they have been there all along Very professional and courteous Doug called us in for any style placement decision Other than that he knew just what to do and how to do it Were delighted Okay what I really mean is my wife is very happy which makes me happy
5,Our technician was Jeremiah who arrived at the scheduled time He was very personable efficient and skillful person Several years ago we had contacted a handyman and wanted several of the things on the above list done Much to our chagrin he didnt have the skill needed nor the patience to complete several of the tasks However he did complete one of the projects we had contracted for him to do We were a little leery of getting another handyman however we joined Angies list and saw the reviews on Mr Handyman and decided to go win him Needles to say we were not disappointed We will definitely use this company again and would not hesitate to recommend him to others
5,They did not keep me waiting The person who answered the phone was able to schedule me right away  the same day The technical arrived within the window they gave me Also they called just to let me know they were on the way Both the person who answered the phone and the technican were very attentitive to my needs and were always very professional and courteous I have never had to pay for more that the first hours They are not the kind of company that works slow so they can charge you more I would happily use them again
5,Very well  was very pleased
5,I was very impressed with the professionalism of Allan and the quick response They were able to do the job on the same day called The work was done neatly and everything was cleaned up before he left He did not leave until I reviewed what he had done I would use them again Great job
5,prompt courteous and professional worker arrived at the time agreed got to work immediately and wored steadily until it was finished I have used Mr Handyman in the past and I particularly appreciate such reliable service All of the tasks are things I could DIY but it would have taken me twice as long and I am just tired from moving unpacking and decorating my new home Selling the previous home was a whole lot of work too and after a while you just get tired and impatient to be finished I was able to do other things while he took care of my HoneyDo List and now my husand wont have to spend his precious weekend on it either Mr Handyman does not disappoint It is pricey but I am trained as an accountant and you just have to pay for this kind of service or they wont be there when you need them again
5,He was terrific  he did everything very well needed no instruction or guidance just the list and was highly professional Ive used him twice now and plan to use him again
5,He touched up the painting fixed the exterior shutters and fixed exterior caulking I was very satisfied by his work
5,Good job Clean and neat that was appreciated
5,This is the second time I called Mr Handyman J is honest hardworking and does great work I was pleased both times I used Mr Handyman and would use them again for sure They are a little pricey but the quality of their work is worth the cost
5,Their first appointment was interrupted by a major storm but we rescheduled Their earlier appointment ran late so they called to let me know then confirmed that the technician was buying the materials He came then the owner came to assist Then they realized that they needed more materials so the owner went to get them The job was much more than we expected because the water damage was more extensive but they got it done Remaining work to be done by the homeowner is more plaster sanding and painting
5,It was excellent They came on very short notice when I needed them
5,Quality work timely Made sure I was satisfied with the result and very professional
5,I would have liked have liked a price to be set before he came I thought the price was a little high but he did a good job This is the second handyman I have had who has not given me the pricing before and I will not be doing that again
5,I called and explained what I needed They were very responsive and had someone out that da They took about the time that they quoted for the service maybe a little less I was very pleased with work
5,From the first call in to Ken to the completion of my list of jobs I was extremely pleased with the work and the service Mr Handyman provided The service technician  I think his name was Doug was so professional  pleasant and very very competent He did an amazing job hanging a very heavy 3 piece mirror that had to be exact in the measurement He even was able to give me good advice on where on the wall to hang it It looks beautiful and I am delighted I had called another Handyman from the norhtwest Baltimore area who is also on Angies List and they could not figure out how to hang the mirror and came up with a ridiculous plan for tearing out my drywall to do the task Needless to say I sent them away but had to pay them anyway So when I called Mr Handman I was a bit discouraged But I cannot say enough about the process and wonderful work Mr Handyman did in my home I would not hesitate to call them again for any job
5,Jeremiah worked efficiently and effectively completed all the tasks we determined could be completed Overall I was very pleased with my experience with Mr Handyman
5,Arrived early which is fine with me came and surveyed the job and went to get the exhaust fan He came back promptly and while working pointed out some issues that should be addressed in the future He found that the fan he bought was too small so he told me he had to go back to get another one but he would be off the clock Came back and finished the installation quickly and professionally It was a little expensive but worth it and would use them again
5,He was very timely professional and friendly
5,All the work with done quickly and very professionally There were some tasks on my list that were out of the scope of their services and they recommended that I conatct a specialist in those cases I really appreciated that advice Just another sign of their professionalism I would call them again in the future and highly recommend them
5,Jeremiah arrived precisely on time He was knowledgeable and efficient He understood exactly what we were looking for and completed all tasks thoroughly Everything continues to work well too  always a good sign We are very pleased with the level of service and professionalism and will definitely use Mr Handyman again
1,Well he was super nice and seemed to know what he was doing But the toilet still runs and the door knob came off in my hand today So the 150 or so that I spent on Mr Handyman was a waste The two problems that were to have been fixed persist I called them today to tell them what happened and they said they could come out again When I explained that it seemed a bit unfair to pay again for the same job they told me the clock starts at 0 and I pay for the time So I said thank you but no thank you I would call another company I am out the  but I dont want to be out even more  to have someone fix something that doesnt stay fixed It wasnt as though the repair person told me the jobs were not fixable But he gave me the bill I paid it and these two pretty simple jobs remain unfixed I did give them a chance to rectify the situation one free hour of work would have been called for right I work and I stayed home for the fix the first time now I would have to stay home again It was a waste of time and money I am going to call someone else
5,Excellent service Called this am  Jeremiah carpenter came out win 2 hrs of call He was clean wore company shirt  drove company truck He evaluated problem gave me relevant information to make decision for repair Removed decaying wood went to store  purchased required materials fixed fascia sections He kept me informed for each step as needed He carried own tools  cearned up area afterwards Am very pleased  requested estimate for two additional jobs Hourly rate can be more expensive than maybe total cost of a job but am happy to know I can get handy man service since I dont know how to do any repairs myself  its always been hard to get someone to come out for small jobs
5,I rely on Mr Handyman to maintain five properties As a parttime landlord with a regular fulltime job I need a trustworthy and competent agent to handle the problems as they pop up Mr Handyman has been able to fix install repair and replace any problem that has come up including replacing doors window screens downspouts caulking laying floors faucets leaks exhaust fans painting cabinets et cetera My tenants like the professionalism of the handymen and the trademark red van
5,Jeremiah arrived on time actually a few minutes early took the time to find out exactly what needed to be done and verified that I had all the necessary materials ready He worked very meticulously all day without taking a break The quality of his work was excellent and I am pretty picky about details This company is not cheap by any means I had been quoted less expensive fees by others but Mr Handyman was able to get me scheduled pretty quickly After experiencing the quality of the work I would have no problem hiring them again as my first choice
5,Outstanding job  my tenant made it a point to call me afterwards and describe how great the repair looked Certainly using these guys again for future repairs
4,He did very well He was on time cleaned up after himself I thought the price was very reasonable from all of the quotes that we had received And almost after a year the wall still looks very nice
4,He was very mechanical minded and had no problems with the chair carrier He wasnt quite as adapt or expereinced with the curtain rod and had to patch up a few mistakes
5,I called the company late in the morning They said they could send someone by the afternoon which was great because it was the first cold day and the window was just propped near its opening The handyman named Dick arrived within the hour And proceeded to quickly fix the window which is oversized and really heavy quickly and quietly Since we had about a half an hour of time left they have an hourly rate plus materials he was kind enough to hang two heavy plaster medallions and give two estimates on future projects I feel very fortunate to have found this company and this wonderful professional and capable workman Thank you Angie I will use them again and again
4,Work went well Handyman arrived on time was able to replace showerhead without cutting into wall but we had asked to replace the handletap that controls the water That required cutting into the wall and replacing the valve along with the handle The work was done clean up was good and he replaced the drywall that he had to cut Good clean up too A few weeks later we noticed water marks on the ceiling of the kitchen below the bathroom Sure enough we had a leak at the valve that had been replaced Handyman was prompt in the response opening the wall again fixing the faulty valve returning a week later to make sure all was okay before closing the wall again They even took care of the celling in the kitchen The leak was not large so there wasnt much to take care of While I was happy with the service I am not sure where the fault lies for the leak was it faulty equipment or work I dont know We will use Handyman again We like the service the response and the convenience Not sure if we will use them for plumbing again
5,It went splendid I was so happy with the work the provider I would recommend them to anyone who wants this type of work done
5,Jeremiah was a very polite courteous professional worker Would definately recommment company
5,Jeremiah was courteous knowledgeable efficient professional and 10 minutes early Great worker
5,Jeremiah was great He was tidy quiet and on time For the sake of my pocket I wish he had been quicker but his work was superior I will certainly ask for him again if I find anything else that needs doing
5,It went great Jeremiah explained all the problems costs and time it would take up front He asked if I was ok with it and he did a great job on the repair
5,It went extremely well The employee was on time announced the start and completion of each task clean up after each task and treated the property with the up most care I will definitely use them again
5,They showed up on time and were very professional They did a great job
2,I hired Alan Deitchs Handyman company to better affix the front shutters to my Baltimore rowhome The shutters were already installed but I wanted two additional screws and holes drilled to affix the centers of the sides to ensure they would not bow with extreme heat or inclement weather To drill 10 holes in my formstone and insert 10 plastic screws it allegedly took nearly 3 hours I have 3 pairs of shutters They were already up It took my contractor less than 2 hours to install them originally There is absolutely no way it took this handyman 3 hours for this work or the handyman was incredibly inept I paid 316 for 10 holes to be drilled into my formstone Thankfully they were drilled well I was taken to the cleaners
5,I made an inquiry with the provider Although I did not use his services he returned my call promptly and professionally
4,Very nice contractors Are always able to come even on short notice Very honest and professional Nice to work with
5,It went well I had a ton of contractors in the house that day and he even helped the electricians by holding some stuff for them while they were also maneuvering under the kitchen sink Easy to schedule Called the week prior for Monday service Hired them for additional work
5,Jerimiah the service technician arrived on time He was very courteous and professional All work scheduled plus an extra job dryer duct cleaning was completed in a timely manner Jerimaih wore shoe covers whenever he was working in the house and did an excellent job cleaning up when he was finished I scheduled a power washing for my home for a later date A company representative called shortly after Jerimiah left to ensure that all work was done to my satisfaction Overall an excellent experience I will use Mr Handyman of N Baltimore County for any other home repairsupgrades
5,Jeremiah did an excellent job of caulking the windows of our home He also cleaned our skylight and straightened our lamp post
5,I called to make the appointment and spoke to someone at the answering service I then received a confirmation call from the company They were willing to work around my schedule which I greatly appreciated I made the appointment 3 days prior to needing services Bob was very nice He was efficient and did a beautiful job with this work For what he did and considering that we purchased the materials I thought the price was high If we had other things for him to do to fill the time I think the cost would have been more reasonable but for this it was too much
5,Jeremiah arrived on time worked efficiently and was very professional I am very satisfied with his work He also did a great job two weeks ago when he replaced rotted wood around windows replaced the post which holds up the porch and caulkedpainted the trim and post Everything looks great I have used Mr Handyman of Northern Baltimore County for various projects in past years and have always found them to be very reliable and professional Quality of work is very good
5,He painted over a gold wall for me when I was moving out of my apartment He did an excellent job and I will use him again
5,Everything went well The technician was not the owner but was friendly and professional I would use them again
5,Jeremiah was punctual and well prepared He completed the jobs promptly and was very competent I appreciated being able to get such quick turn around Called them last Thursday they had someone here thee days later
4,Great communication good work did what he said he would do
3,I thought that Mr Handyman of Northern Baltimore County was very expensive and they have workers that join and leave the company Sometimes I have work done okay sometimes I have them as tacky so Im very very reluctant to use the company Theyre very quick to respond and I like that its just the level of work that you get is not consistent The price is very expensive I will probably not use them again
5,It went excellent I just left the garage door open and he started to work on it I would recommend his services to others
5,The work was done very well very quickly and Alan was exceptional about communicating schedule price and progress The price was slightly higher than another estimate I got but Alans professionalism was worth the difference Would definitely use them again
5,Dick showed up at 800 in the dot I showed him what needed doing we discussed it a little bit and he got to work When it came to the damp crumbly wall behind the tiles in the shower I was disturbed by what was there and concerned that this would entail way beyond what I was expecting Dick was able to use some quick setting cement and build a wall to which he was able to attach the old tile The wall looks great  all the tiles are back in line and in their proper alignment once again One of the reasons I will use Handyman of Baltimore County again aside from the quality of work is the ability to have someone come out on relatively short notice I called on Monday expecting it would be a couple of weeks before someone would be able to come do the work and Ken told me someone could be there Wednesday morning From what Ken and Dick both told me this is the norm for them I appreciated that the estimate for the amount of time needed to complete the work was right on target despite the bathroom wall needing more attention and work than originally thought and a minor snag with one of the ceiling fans
5,They were always prompt efficient knowledgeable and more than willing to offer a less expensive solution Had I not moved away from the area Id still be calling them regularly
4,It went well The basic work was done very well The only regret that I had was that I was communicating with service person from work He was great sending pictures by phone to help me choose what I wanted but when he asked about finishing off the handrails I didnt fully understand what he meant It ended up taking him at least an hour longer thus cost me more If I had seen and realized what he was doing I would have passed on finishing it so it looked real nice I think that this was my fault for not being home when the work was being performed And I do intend to use them again for future projects
5,My window had received a lot of damage due to multiple massive storms There was such a huge gap between the upper facia board above the window and the exterior of the house that water would continually rush in Since this was a large area that had water damage the provider assured me that they would be able to at least start work on the area the day they were scheduled to show up There was initial confusion about scheduling but the owner gave me multiple choices that worked with my schedule and we were finally able to come up with a great solution Once the provider arrived the service tech looked at the problem and started work right away He told me that if anything additional needed to be done they could get the materials that day and hopefully finish in a few hours Originally the estimated that the entire day would be utilized for the work He was able to assess additional areas tht I had suspected had succumed to water damage but he noted that their integrity was ok and didnt need to be replaced I had others look at the same area my wood floor and told me that they would have to rip it all up and replace it even though there was no visable damage It was reassuring to know that I was getting an honest oponion and that replacing the floor was only cosmetic and not needed The service tech was able to complete the work in only a few hours and used quick dry materials around my window because we were supposed to get a huge storm and he wanted to make sure that it dried in time Additionally he painted the trim around the areas to top it all off I was so pleased with the work that I asked him to check out a few other areas and received some suggestions Ive already called them up to schedule anotehr appointment I saved so much money and time with them that I will always have them on call
5,Super puntual pleasant works with you I had a misunderstanding from the office Didnt realize the customer has to specify if windows need cleaning both in  out Plus customer needs to provide cleaner for inside No problem for Mr handyman He sailed out purchased the necessary cleaners of course we reimbursed him and got the job done The windows sparkle husband said its too bright inside house  Dirty awning is lovely again Doesnt spoil your appetite when eating under it Green algae is gone from white siding Looks like new Super10 rating from this family Well certainly call on Mr Handyman again Gail Frantz
4,on time professional had to assemble and adjust the surround to fit fireplace and uneven walls discovered a gape in the fireplace that went to the outside filled the hole on the inside and went outside and filled all holes found it was expensive because of the time it took to complete but I wanted it done right and I am pleased
5,I spoke directly to the owner on the phone and he was courteous and friendly and got me scheduled for the handyman to come within 3 days He also explained the pricing and recommended I buy my own supplies to save myself some money The handyman that came confirmed that that saved me a lot of money I got a call the morning the handyman was scheduled to come saying that he would be a few minutes late because of traffic He showed up perhaps 15 minutes late not a problem at all and got right to work He finished within about 3 12 hours slightly longer than I thought it would take but the work was very good This company charges by the hour or fraction thereof something I especially appreciate since I didnt want to have to pay for a full 4th hour when he only worked a portion of it Overall I think this company is slightly pricey but the work was solid and they are punctual responsible and courteousvery important things in my book I would definitely contact them again
4,Very well The young carpenter did all the work He had to go to LowesHome Depot for the replacement wood and stain I had purchased the light fixtures He charged me for the materials and minimal extra time I was very satisfied with all the tasks
5,Mr handyman was late about one half hour on the 1st day Other than that one time punctuality was good He promised to call me each day after he finished his work but I never got a call Those with only problems The work done was quality work and Im quite pleased with the result I can now enter my home through the front door with my power chair In my home is more secure new deadbolts in front and back My refrigerator is making ice I like the work so much that I asked Mr handyman to look at some of the jobs that need to be done around the house and in the yard
5,I was pleased with the work they did
5,Came on time completed work cleaned up
5,They came the same day that I called They were on time and it only took them about 15 minutes to do the work I had purchased a unit for 138 from Home Depot because I thought they would need the piece however he told he didnt need it I was able to take it back and get a refund so they ended up saving me some money as well
5,They charged on an hourly rate and they were expensive However they did a great job
5,I called Mr Handyman Alan and explained to him it was an unusual job but after some discussion and feedback I decided to go forward The young man who came out was professional ontime and friendly I explained the service I needed completed and he got to work When I returned at the end of the day I was very happy with the results The workmanship was spot on and the detail was excellent Basically he had to create a custom mount for the hoop and backboard My father who is an architect oversaw the work as I was not able to be there at the time He was impressed with the detail and design that was put into the project The only comment I would make is that this was a two person job and my dad had to help a couple of times He is 70 and is not in the best shape so that made me uncomfortable However it was a minor detail and overall the work was done to expectations Based on this one experience I will utilize their services again Thanks Mr Handyman
5,They called me a little before the original time they had quoted to say he was available after his last appointment ended a little early It was a good time for me so he came out looked over the job put down a drop cloth asked where he could access water and then brought his tools in He did a great job covering the crack in the ceiling and when he left it wasnt quite dry but looked much better The next day you wouldnt know there was ever a crack there
5,They do the work on hourly basis The man that they sent was flexible in terms of what he was able to do He was quite pleasant and was willing to work with me He was professional and friendly It was the best price
5,I sent out quote requests to a few different companies and Mr Handyman was the most responsive the owner and I exchanged emails several times Their price was good compared to the other estimates I got I was not actually home when the work was completed I was at work and my housemate was home instead I would have asked for the mudding to be smoothed out a bit more but I cant fault them for leaving it as they did as I was not there and it wasnt bad so I could not justify calling them back Im also a bit pickier than most people ah well Id definitely hire them again though so no true complaints only praises
5,The young man that was doing the work was very considerate because I was immobile so he would take pictures of what he was doing and would come downstairs and show me each step of the project and I thought that was pretty nice of him They were a nice company to deal with They were nice good people The price was fair I had to check into some prices on their installation and I thought the price was fair for everything that they did I might use them again for something else a couple of weeks from now This was right before Christmas and I was surprised that they came out when they did I was very happy with them They were here right on time when they said they were going to be here They said eight O clock and they were here The young man was very good at his job and what he did was excellent
5,I think they did a good job and the workman arrived when he was supposed to He was very courteous and friendly I think he did a good job I think the price was a little high for the amount of work that he did but it was something that needed to be done so it was fine He was only here for a few hours
5,They were fine and they did exactly what they needed to do
5,They really did an excellent job They were responsive punctual and professional
5,My 1st experience with this company and angies list was very positive I discussed that repairs were needed to the siding of the house and the contractor Jeremiah was out and fixed it within 2 days He came out when they said he would Jeremiah noted that the siding was originally installed incorrectly and that an option would be to replace vs repair it I decided to just have it repaired for now I inspected the finished work and it was great I was afraid the heavy winds we just experienced after he repaired it would rip it off againI This company Mr Handyman did a follow up call to see if I was satisfied They get the importance of positive word of mouth and recommendations from angies list This was a small job only 170 but they did great I recommend you call them for jobs including small jobs too
1,Version10 StartHTML0000000105 EndHTML0000002843 StartFragment0000002290 EndFragment0000002807 First they cound do all the work They wouldnt come to my home ti check out things and give an estimate They wanted to come out and do the work first hour 200 one person hour 100 how stupid do they think your members are They should rename their company from MrHandyman to Sucker Hunters This was my first Angies List experience Hope not my last
5,After we dipped stripped sanded primed and painted the 50 shutters they needed to be rehung The other company canceled out 4 times over a month not due to the weather so I fired them I used Angies List and called Mr Handyman Great response They came out a few days later arrived exactly on time did all the work which took five hours and didnt even stop for lunch They worked hard and rehung all my shutters That is a fun job on a 40 foot ladder We are totally satisfied with their responsiveness and work The mechanics were friendly did the work efficiently and well They even found a woodpecker hole in a hidden area of the siding and fixed it They just did it rather than diddle around waiting for an OK to spend 15 minutes on the task That was appreciated
5,Was excellent jobjust adding a review now because a neighbor needs Caulking done on their bathroom  possible tub door They asked us who did ours I was sure it was Mr Handyman but was not sure of location My cancelled check showed the Owings Mills locationThe gentleman who did the work was the best On time  our location is not always easy to find Professional Friendly I should have entered this review at time of the work  but just moved in and got busy I would recommend them highly I cant believe that others rated them B on pricing I was thrilled with the price  I absolutely got what I paid for if not more A in my book
5,He completed all the repairs correctly and quick He was all business and everything he fixed is working properly I was satisfied with his work but I do feel he could have completed the work a little bit cleaner which is just a minor detail On a scale of 110 I would give him a 9
5,We were impressed from start to finish We have done a lot of remodeling on our 1920s bungalow ourselves over the years so we appreciate what goes into labor When I described our project to Ken over the phone he immediately knew what needed to be done and how long it would take so we felt like he knew his stuff When I called to schedule the appointment they were able to perform the job within a few days They arrived early making it more convenient for us and they finished the job in less time than we expected We know that cutting through plaster and lathe is messy job and we were impressed with how clean they kept everything We were very pleased with their service and would definitely recommend them and plan on using them for future projects
5,Could not be happier with the entire job He not only did excellent work throughout the entire process but several times gave me suggestions that would save me money on the repairs He was able to fix a basement water problem that led to water damage that another Handyman service failed to solve
5,I contacted Mr Handyman to get a leak from rains in my garage and bathroom repaired I had got this problem looked at in the past and all previous repairs did not work The service professional from Mr Handyman arrived for the appointment on time He detected the cause of the leak and made another appointment to come out and fix it as the job would have taken a long time to finishAs this was a two person job the owner also came to assist on the day of the job The job was done very well and with meticulous attention to detail He explained the problems that he saw and even took photographs of the areas that were causing the leaks and texted them to me later To my delight after completing the job the owner followed up with me after the first major rain storm The leak had been mostly plugged but I could still see a little bit of water coming through He came out again within the next 2 days retested for the leak and again spent 2 to 3 hours fixing the issue
5,This was my first experience with Angies List and also the first tiem hiring a handyman I was very impressed with Mr Handyman They were very responsive punctual and professional I would definitely use this company again
5,Mr Handyman is very professional start to finish They called to let me know the approximate time the worker was coming then they followed up to make sure I was happy with the work The Handyman was very nice clean and knowledgeable He installed 3 light fixtures one which had a slight problem in how the previous fixture was hung and he handled that no problem I was very happy with their work and their responsiveness to my needs
1,Very unprofessional and prejudice Update 8272012 After I left my review on Angies List Mr Deitch called me on Monday morning and harassed and threatened me regarding the review I found that his professionalism has its limits He is very responsive which I appreciated but I strongly suggest hiring someone else
5,A big thanks to Alan and Brian I needed a very important job done the next day It turned out to require MUCH more time than anticipated because i was in a panic and did not state the number of windows But Alan adjusted the work schedule for the day took one of the jobs himself and my job was completed that day Brian worked so hard in the heat and was kind and professional Thank you so much
1,Mr Handyman Ken cancelled my appointment three times he said that he had emergencies each time I rescheduled my appointment each time to get estimates for home repairs The latest appointment was today and he just didnt show up I called the office to see if he was indeed coming after he didnt show up at the appointment time At this point I told the people in the office to just not even send him This was my 1st and last experience with Mr Handyman If Ken really didnt want the job he should have never set the appointments Very disappointed
3,The company is very responsive and I appreciated being able to communicate via email I asked for and got an estimate Although I confirmed the appointment for a certain time the contractor had a scheduling problem and had to arrive about 1 hour later Especially after reading the prices for the work performed for others in their reviews and realizing the actual work that was performed for me I believe I paid too much for the work
5,Alan returned my initial phone call immediately and although the job was small one he still accommodated us At all times he and his partner were very professional and courteous Thank you very much
5,Mr Handyman is the best Called Alan and set up an appt Alan is very accomodating and knows his stuff Anthony came out on the scheduled day right on time and ready to work I cannot say enough about Anthony He is hardworking professional very knowledgable and extremely respectful of your home and family You can tell he tries very hard to make the someone in your house working aspect as nonintrusive as possible But on top of all this is the actual work he does All I can say is he is a perfectionist Impeccable We love our new bathroom because it really does look like a brand new bathroom We are already making plans to have him come out again Thank you Alan and Anthony
5,After trying and failing to replace a leaking water line to my refrigerator myself I scheduled a repair appointment with Sears only to be contacted the day of that they dont do plumbing I had some electrical work that needed to be done as well so I looked for someone who could do both I was a little hesitant to use a handyman company due to a previous experience when the repairman was unable to complete the work I specifically requested and I ended up looking for things for him to do since I had to pay anyway The benefit of having one person do it all led me to call Mr Handyman of Baltimore County I called early in the morning and they were able to fit me in that afternoon I was reassured that if they were unable to do the work as promised I would not be charged The repairman showed up an hour early He was very efficient in his work and had a clear understanding of what was involved He was able to perform both the plumbing and electrical work and was kind enough to let me watch so I could understand what I had done wrong with the refrigerator line I had been told ahead of time to pick up the replacement items I wanted and I did have to run back to the hardware store while the repairman was here to exchange one of the items but that allowed him to keep working He finished all the work in a little over 2 hours and left everything very neat I thought it was expensive but if I had hired a plumber and an electrician Im sure it would have cost me more and I would have had to find time in my schedule for 2 appointments Overall I was very pleased and would hire them again
4,Called company via listing number on Angies List Was able to make contact with Alan right away who discussed job asked for digital photos and quoted rates We initially thought it was a post in the ground but after taking pictures I found out that the post was bolted onto the side of the stairs I also discovered that the topknob decoration on the existing post was a separate piece of decorative wood that would be removable I had paint on hand from a new paint job that was completed in the prior couple of weeks Alan scheduled a visit for Friday May 4 and estimated that the total work would probably be 4 hours including time taken to source the 4x4 post prepare it mount it and paint it Given cost of supplies and Mr Handymans hourly rates the estimate was right on the money Overall work was passable if not totally matching The major missing parts were small and I discovered them well after providing payment  The corners of the replacement wood were not sandedbeveled so they dont quite exactly match the rest of the bannister The reused top decoration for the post was not remounted entirely centered Painting was decent and matched All other work was done satisfactorily but the waste was not disposed of this was part of the original understanding and quote Overall a good job with some minor quality issues that prevent an all As rating but a good effort I got what I paid for
5,The handyman that came was professional and polite did the prescribed work and even followed me to the home improvement store to get the replacement door Cant say enough good things about the final product The only downside is it was a bit pricey but for the service provided excellent
5,I contacted Alan on Monday about the work to be done He had a man at my house on Wednesday morning We went over the work to be done and I left him alone In a few hours he was done and my steps were once again safe to walk on
5,Don arrived right on time and easily installed a new replacement lighting fixture over my dining table He was very patient with my fretting about the height of the pendant over the table I also had him do some exterior touch up painting to keep my HOA happy I had thought I should replace my louvred gable vent with a pvc one but when he went up to measure it it wasnt in as bad shape as Id thought so he just puttied and repainted it And he measured it so that when I do need to get it replaced Ill know the correct size He was very nice pleasant and knowledgable I have used Mr Handyman before and will use them in the future
5,I think it is a franchise They are fabulous I have used them on numerous occasions and they do everything They are not cheap but they work well and they are very efficient They do the work right and they are fair I would use their services again in the future
5,They were on time and they got the job done quickly They were very thorough
5,Great company Honest punctual and stands by their work
5,It was a very good experience The name of the person who came out was Peter and he was very efficient He seemed to know exactly what he had to do and did it and did it in good time He cleaned up after himself I would use them again in the future
4,Overall work was great Called back about 3 times to get more things done A little expensive due to pay scale but worht it
5,He was punctual professional and productive with his time
5,As usual Chris did an excellent job He arrived on time and got right to work as their price is calculated at an hourly rate Upon creating an opening to our attic we found out that the were nests that birds have built throughout the years Chris cleaned the mess and nests and enclosed our attic vents with wiry mesh to alleviate the bird problem Again he stayed over not included in the price and answered questions and quoted us on future jobs I think that they are a little pricey but what you pay for is what you get and it is well worth it I believe that Chris has become our official handyman Also Alan is a pleasure to speak with on the phone
5,Professional work performed by Sean Job site was kept neat and clean during and at the conclusion of the service call Time was well managed Couldnt have gone better
5,From start to finish I felt comfortable with this company Reading the reviews about this company I had high expectations And they showed up Alan was very pleasent patient friendly and professional when I spoke with him on the phone to make the appointment Chris came to our house and did the job as promised He showed and was very professional and pleasent to talk to He came and got right to work after listening to all of my concerns he was extremely efficient and didnt waste any time After he was done he stayed and spoke with me and my husband about concerns and questions we had about other jobs we are planning He is extremely knowledgeable and helpful I am looking forward to their services again and I absolutely reccommend them for any work that you might have Well done
5,They came out same day for appointment and commenced work following day Completed day after that Very responsive and professional
4,Great and our handyman was very pleasant and courteous and thoughtful in his work and remarks
5,I was super happy with them They were responsive showed up on time professional and the work was done as promised I would highly recommend them
5,It looks terrific He measured thoroughly and always asked us what we wanted before doing anything so it was just how we wanted He was a little slow which did effect price but I think it was because he was being so careful which we really appreciated
5,Everything was great Very professional and punctual Were willing to come out same day We will definitely hire them again
5,Excellent from start to finish Couldnt be happier
4,They are pretty good I havent had any problems with them It is the second thing I have had done The price is a little high but their service is worth it I had to call back a couple of times to get them so I cant give them highest marks for responsiveness I will use them again in the future
5,I called Mr Handyman in the morning for an estimate to install a new over the range microwave They were able to have someone out in the afternoon of the same day to complete the job The technician was on time very friendly very clean and very fast I highly recommend Mr Handyman
5,No surprises all was explained before hand Doug did an excellent job I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Ken Dunns operation and especially Doug  We have been using Kens Mr Handyman since 2009 We have always been pleased and have recommended him t several people
5,The technician was very prompt and arrived at the scheduled time I explained what I wanted done He did the work in the order that I wanted done In the repairs of the window he also cleaned off putty that has been put on by other parties He blew off the roof with a small electric blower that was barely up to what was required He was very good at checking the gutters for cleanliness The repairs to the two sections of gutter that had been damaged by falling branches were makeshift He did not explain any alternate solutions such as replacement of the sections I was impressed by how quickly he worked but would have been happier with a better repair of the gutters
5,The experience was very good They price was reasonable and he was very responsive
5,excellent service from start to finish will use again
3,Overall the experience was okay He was able to find  fix the leak but he ended up cutting a hole in the ceiling of my living room without offering any way of fixing the hole even if there would have been an initial charge He stapled some Saran wrap on the ceiling where the hole is Now Im in the process of fixing the ceiling hole through another vendor
5,The projects went very well and were completed in less time than I had expected The technician was very competent professional personable and well organized He also provided some valuable tips and advice regarding a couple of other issues
5,Chris with Mr Handyman was EXCELLENT He completed several handyman tasks on my 80 yearold home this fall He was efficient professional and very pleasant He completed the work more quickly than anticipated and made helpful suggestions for costsaving options He even cleaned up after himself I will definitely use him for my future handyman needs

5,Mr Handyman came promptly at 800am went over the checklist and got to work went through the checklist item by item did not waste anytime worked hard took a 15min break for lunch finished at 430pm Finally after many many months my long list was done in oneday Amazing
5,I called Mr Handyman in the morning and they sent a technician the same afternoon He arrived his name is Mr White on time with a smile on his face and a professional attitude He was eager to help tackle the two pictures He explained the billing process clearly and began installing the molding He also offered time saving tips since I was charged by the half hour like opening products to be used and arranging them around the room where they needed to be placed Mr White was thorough in centering the frames and installed the undercounter lights neatly and quickly I was well pleased with these services and will call them today for another project
5,We were very pleased with our experience The handyman did a great job and there were three things that stood out for us 1 Punctuality and promptness start to finish I got a fast callback after I submitted my inquiry on the web and the handyman was right on time 2 We really felt like he was trying to do his best for us  pointing out things that could be done on our own easily and mentioning a couple of roofing issues that he discovered while cleaning the gutters and was able to fix right away We appreciated the honesty and felt like they were really intending to provide us value for our money 3 He even gave us some tips on how to do a couple of jobs that we plan to do ourselves bettermore easily We will definitely call them again the next time we have a need for handyman services
5,They come on time they clean up after themselves and they do the work with minimal hassle They have came out twice and I would reccomend them highly
5,First of all I submitted a request for service online and literally someone called me within a half hour of my request The person who called me was the owner and he was extremely nice The handyman comes in a market van and he worked very neatly and was very professional He seemed able to do a lot of things He did an excellent job on the guest room   and the repairs needed were pretty extensive He was unable to repair the ceiling fan because it needed a part it wasnt the easiest to troubleshoot   but I felt he understood all the possible issues and worked to isolate the problem All in all I just found it so nice that in one phone call you could have multiple projects done   so simple
5,the fix was perfect Technician was on time and creative in the fix
5,Mr Handyman was outstanding The work was finished timely and the estimates were close to the actual bill It was wonderful to have Mr Handyman fix the issues that came with my new home allowing me to come home and relax
5,Great They came when they said and did the work quickly and well
5,He was great The whole experience with this company was great the went way beyond what most companies would do Since I live out of state they made me feel very confident about my property I will use them again and recommend the to others in that area
5,Mr Handyman called me back After I explained what I need to have done he told me that this particular job really required a licensed plumber So he gave me a referral to a plumber and I have been very happy with the referral I really appreciated Mr Handymans honesty professionalism anmd integrity
5,The service is extremely professional and convenient to use Great for an out of town landlord They take time to explain work etc Rates are high given that Ive found good handy men for 50hr etc However if you need to insure you get a dependable and trustworthy contractor this is an excellent option
5,They were very professional responsive and easy to work with in all cases I actually referred them to several of my friends and will use them in the future
5,He was punctual and very professional and courteous He did an excellent job and even went to the store to get the right shade of paint since the one I had was no longer good He was neat and did not leave a mess I was very happy with everything that was done
5,The job went well with good results
5,Extremely pleased The project turned out better than I ever could have imagined Their professionalism was exceptional I felt comfortable leaving them my keys and they completed the bulk of the work while I was out of town The hourly rate of this company is a bit hirer than others but they are extremely quick efficient and professional in the execution fo the projects I believe in the end the total price is lower than their competitors because they finish projects in much less time and the end results are impeccable
5,Task1 was installed in two visits First visit involved repair of two 24x30 holes created by removal of two inwall air conditioning units by HVAC contractor Units were in the knee walls of the third floor of our 1935 wood shingle home Chris arrived promptly as scheduled sized up job and worked diligently most of which was on done on the ladder He successfully found a lumberyard that had shingles that matched those on our house primed and painted the installed shingles Work was done so seamlessly that you cant tell where the repairs were made Second visit involved removal of an inwall window size air conditioning unit on the first floor Repairs were made to the exterior shingled wall as well as drywall repair to the interior wall Again Chris was able to find a lumberyard that carried molding that matched the existing interior molding The first two jobs were so well done we consulted with Alan and Chris about Task 2 installing hardwood flooring in our third floor master bedroom Previous owners had converted the attic into a master bedroom suite Original flooring was pine with walltowall carpeting Stairs leading to third floor were also pine Alan estimated material needed and provided suggestions of where to find good quality flooring at reasonable prices Following selection of flooring and stairs we called Alan to schedule installation of the flooring while we were on vacation We returned home to a beautifully installed floor and stairs We had one minor mishap during the flooring installation Sawing of the flooring tripped our smoke alarm Chris immediately called us to let us know what had happened seconds after being called by ADT we were able to arrange for ADT to turn off the alarm To avoid any chance of a recurrence Chris performed all additional sawing outside All work was done extremely professionally and clean up was excellent
2,On 120 I spoke with Ken and scheduled an appointment for 900 AM on 126 for an estimate When no one arrived by 920 I called the office Ken could not locate the painter and did not know why he did not show up The estimate was recheduled for 127 at 830 When his painter arrived the next day there was no apology offered I showed him the work to be done and he told me Ken would call me the next day I did not get a phone call on 128 so I called Ken on 129 His receptionist told me he would call me right back in a few minutes No phone call I called back 90 minutes later and was told by the receptionist that an estimate would be mailed that day On 22 there was still no estimate I called once more and was told it was mailed last week It is now 8 days later and I still have no estimate verbal or written from this company
5,This is the best experience I have ever had with a home handyman in 35 years of hiring them I was doubtful based on past experience that this could go very well but was so very pleasantly surprised Not cheap but given that he didnt waste my time or his he had proper equipment and he was knowledgeable I think it was well worth the cost
5,Chris was on time very polite and professional He completed the job in a timely manner The chair rail looks great He cut each piece at a 45 degree angle so they fit together seamlessly Then he caulked all the nail holes and seams The only problem was that the job took longer than the manager had estimated on the phone so it was more pricey than we originally thought Other than that we were very pleased with the work
5,Alan and Chris are both experienced contracters and they do superb work They did not waste time were cooperative and friendly 
5,They came and did a whole days worth of work The price was a little high but its hard for a handyman not to charge that much
5,The person that showed up knew what he was doing He was easy to direct and worked efficiently
5,Outstanding job Very satisfied
5,Very well
5,They were very helpful
5,They were excellent They had a 4hour minimum They were extremely good Whatever I asked the tech to do he did I would certainly hire him again He cleaned up and everything was left in fine condition The price was good because it would have been difficult to coordinate that many different people to do the various jobs
5,The time to do the requested jobs was pretty much on target I felt like they were using their time wisely and efficiently This fellow that they sent out clearly knew what he was doing and was able to tick the items off the list that we needed
5,I called the company on Friday evening and got the answering service who told me the company would be in touch with me on Monday morning They called around 830 AM Monday and asked me to describe the work He told me they charge 13800 for the first hour or fraction thereof and 88 for each additional hour which is billed in 15 minute increments at 22 When I agreed he said they would be out between 100 and 300 PM Monday and would call approximately 12 hour before arriving They called back around 945 AM and said they were running ahead of schedule and could come earlier if it was convenient for me which it was At about 1030 AM the technician arrived I showed him the electric eye and the dryer He set about his work and was finished in about 45 minutes I inspected the work and he did an excellent job I was quite pleased
5,Very punctual Work was of high quality Although cost of replacing screens was high I cant say if someone who charges by the job would have been less The job took longer then originally thought but removing the old screens was more difficult then expected This was because of the way siding around the area had been attached by someone else The quality of the work was excellent so the cost was worth it Worker was professional and personable I would use them again and plan to in the fall for some jobs we discussed Highly recommended
4,The deck job that they did for us went very well The price was reasonable and the quality of work was great I had called the company again for another estimate on a different job I talked to the receptionist in the office and she said shed take the message However I never got a call back from the company This was the only bad experience that we had with this company
5,Mr Handyman showed up at the time appointed dressed in a uniform and driving a Van with a Mr Handyman advertisement on it This was good because I live in a small condominium and it is reassuring to elderly neighbors The AC units had been permanently installed in old casement windows on the 2nd floor so I was very reluctant to tackle the removal on my own He had the units out very quickly and used storm windows to create a replacement pane There was time left so he unclogged some drains which I was very glad because one turned out to be completely rusted through I had to get a different plumber to replace that drain because it is a very old building and we only use one licensed plumber But I had Mr Handyman come back to fix some tiles I also had holes in the ceiling from where the electrician had been Mr Handyman fixed those holes beautifully I could tell this guy had extensive experience with drywall I dealt with Ken on the phone and 2 different guys came out to do the work Ken is very easy to deal with and they are professional I am pleased to have the work done so is my husband I got rid of the honeydo list
5,The experience was great with the office staff and Alan who was efficient and very professional and explained the process as he was doing the projects
5,I had a shower installed by a reputable contractor Unfortunately his installation of the shower was not up to code and the drain failed which caused a massive leak in my kitchen ceiling I called Mr Handyman and they sent a technician who replaced the drywall in the ceiling and feathered the edges so that the patch will look like the remainder of the kitchen ceiling It was nice to have a contractor show up on time be experienced clean up and be able to speak and understand English I would highly recommend this company
5,Excellent experience The process of making the appointment was easy and professional The representative Alan was punctual professional knowledgeable helpful and friendly He showed concern in maximizing the efficient use of time readily answered questions and offered helpful suggestions Would gladly use this firm again and am planning to do so in the future
5,They gave me an estimate over the phone They were able to do the work sooner than scheduled He hustled and did not waste any time He was helpful knowledgeable and eager to do the work He was honest and did not try to sell me things that I didnt need They are accommodating
5,They came when they said they were going to come They handyman who came out was very thorough and reliable They did what they said they were gonna do
5,We called Mr Handyman based on reports in Angies List about a week ago and were able to schedule the work within the week Before Alan appeared the company called to confirm the appointment Alan showed up exactly on time and worked steadily all day long until the job was completed His boss Alan Deitch even appeared early on to see how things were going and stayed for quite awhile to help We were very pleased with the professionalism of the two men who showed up and the excellent job that was done to reroof our shed It is now better than it was when it was new
5,He arrived on time dressed in uniform with a truck full of what he needed to make that floor perfect He replaced one full sheet of plywood purchasing and hauling a new sheet of plywood up to my third floor no elevator coop and hauled away and disposed of the old sheet of plywood He was pleasant polite knowledgeable and efficient The dispatcher was also wonderful calling to tell me that he might be early She was efficient and very personable as well I will definitely use them again
5,They have come several times and done some small and large jobs for us They have remodeled several rooms for us and have done a wonderful job We have been very satisfied with the services they have done for us The technician that was assigned to us has been excellent and very detail oriented
5,He arrived on time  was very helpful My only small concern was that he needed to spend part of his time going to the store to buy the threshold piece Since Id told the company ahead of time I thought that was needed it would have been nice if they had sent that along In retrospect he also could have given me a shopping list so I could get it while he was shaving the door The run to the store added a fair amt of time to the job Overall it went well Im glad he was there because I also had a plumber doing other work who needed a hand getting an old water heater out of the house and it was fortunate that Mr Handyman was there to well be handy Id use them again but only if I had enough tasks to take at least 2 hr and if possible Id try to have supplies available I could always return unneeded parts
1,Overall this went badly The work was done poorly I felt very overcharged and cheated The worker came on time started with the Lazy Susan moved on to the toilet paper holder and then left my home He returned about 15 minutes later and finished all work after one hour and 10 minutes not two hours I was charged for two hours and parts Spackle drywall putty screen 50 lb dry wall anchors which he went to the hardware store to buy I think a handyman service especially when they know the job to be done should be prepared with the appropriate parts The ceiling was a mess when he left screen showing not smoothed off at all Lazy Susan broke again about two weeks later
5,The work was outstanding I had asked for around five estimates before I hired him and even if he was not the cheapest one the price was completely fair and reasonable I called and they gave me an estimate over the phone
5,He was very thorough He actually showed me what he was doing and overall he was very professional I even added a job while he was here and he was able to take care of that for me
5,I would definitely call this company again They were courteous over the phone and Dave was prompt friendly and worked like a dog The project went into a second day and the company rescheduled Dave so that he could come back two days after the first one to finish the job
4,Overall the job went well We set up an appointment for three weeks after we called Mr Handyman called a few days before the appointment to confirm On the day of the appointment we received a call from the contractor letting us know that the employee that was scheduled to come out to the house had called out sick They did send another employee out that same day to do the work John did come later than we scheduled for He arrived at 435 pm and got right to work on the dry rot While the wood filler was drying he replaced the shutters John told us that the wood filler was not completely dry so he would have to return the next day He did return at 555 pm the next day to paint the wood It took a little under an hour When we checked the work everything seemed fine but the next day we noticed that the wood filler had sunken in We wrote to Mr Handyman to let them know and they promptly sent John and another employee out to correct the problem at no charge
5,Called on a Tues  was told Thu  Fri were available On Wed these times were gone I couldnt find anyone else so on Thu set up appt for following Thu They are pricey 216 for the first 2 hours thereafter billed in 15 min increments 88hr For that price you get highly qualified technician We opted to buy most of the stuff beforehand but the tech did need to shop for some specialty items The tech was supposed to show up at 8a but had car trouble Mary the office mgr called me at 805a to let me know this he showed up at 9a and finished by 2p Most impressive fixing the kitchen exhaust fan it would been quite costly to replace this He also didnt have to replace the garbage disposal as we thought was necessary wires just needed to be connected correctly The tech was pleasant and knowledgeable Mary was very helpful on the initial call Would definitely use them again and highly recommend them to others
5,Allen the manager was professional providing an estimate on the phone when I called for a job The job I described sounded like 23 hours job and Rickie came 30min late due to an accident on the road One of the problem was a long hole on the main door and Rickie suggested that the door is not secure and I decided to replace it It ended up costing me a lot but I think it was a right decision I could tell he had done it many many times We went to shopping he took the old doors and everything out adjusted the wall from 83inches to 80 inches and put the new doors in It was great that even though he was supposed to be there for 23hours he asked Allen to move other schedule and stayed a whole day to get it done He cared details and the job was done well

5,I had the pleasure of working with Ben at AHI for a bathroom renovation and change of bedroom flooring in my condo  My unit was built in 2001 and it was screaming Outdated  Ben presented some ideas that upgraded my unit to present time  He worked around my budget and was able to improvise when needed  The team that Ben put together for my projects was AMAZING  Felixs team handled my flooring and I absolutely love it  Jose and Romeo created the bathroom of my dreams  Julian completed my dream bathroom with a custom shower door  The quality and beauty of a custom shower door from Julian will make you frown upon any other kind of shower door its a game changer  All teams were respectful of my unit by being extra clean and noiseconscious when removing the prior flooring and demolishing the bathroom  Everyone working on my projects was detailoriented diligent and stayed on track with the projected date of completion  Ben visited my unit regularly to monitor the progress of the projects  He also assisted with answering any questions that the HOA had  All in all my experience with AHI was extremely positive  Everything is beautiful  the outcome exceeds my expectations  In addition everything was completed within budget and on time  Looking forward to reaching out to Ben again for my next project

5,It was a time for a new roof on my home and I went with American Home improvement for that job Eli and his team did amazing job they made it so simple and with no mistakes The price was reasonable and my new roof looks brilliant and my complete house looks much better now Thank you American Home Improvement
5,American Home Improvement built an outdoor kitchen on my request I am so happy I went with them because they were awesome and did outstanding job Everything went well and I can recommend this company high enough
5,American Home Improvement remodeled my 2 bathrooms My wife had some special requests and this guys provided all she wanted The price was fair they did excellent job and price didnt changed at the end of the project I cant ask for more
5,Moti and his team did a really great job for me They added an addition to my house it was 1 big room I got recommendation on American Home Improvement from my friend and they also have many excellent reviews so I contacted them to see what options would they offer to me I was very satisfied with their answer and I hired them As I said before Moti and his team were great made complicate project pretty simple The quality of work was at  highest standards so they deserves highest recommendation
5,I am very pleased with my master bathroom renovation recently completed by American Home Improvement  Neev the Senior Project Manager and Tal the foreman worked to keep me posted as the job progressed  Any problems were solved to my satisfaction  There were a few delays so the project took longer than expected but it looks great The day to day trade workers were very respectful professional and hard workers  I would recommend this company to others planning a home renovation
5,"Im not one to typically post a review but after our recent experience with American Home Improvement and specifically our project manager Neev Kugel I felt obliged to comment on their phenomenal work  We contracted them to remodel our kitchen as well as redo the flooring in adjacent rooms and other related improvements  I was extremely impressed by how professional Neev and the whole operation was from start to finish  Outside of knowing we wanted to update our kitchen my wife and I really didnt have a clear vision on exactly how we wanted it to look  We essentially put our faith and trust in Neev to deliver an end product that we would love and he didnt disappoint  At the start of the project Neev brought in designers who were very knowledgeable creative and receptive to our ideas to help create a contemporary and elegant design that both my wife and I loved  From there Neev developed the project plan and timeline that was consistent with the original estimate  
Throughout the entire process Neev was very communicative and would always clearly outline next steps so we knew what to expect  This made the process much smoother and reduced the typical frustration that can come with remodels because we always knew the status of the work  

Now this is not to say the project was completed without any snags  As with any project there were surprises that came up  However Neev always worked with us to explain the issue outline our options and would work with us to make sure we were happy with the final outcome All of the workers brought into our home showed the same level of professionalism and quality craftsmanship  Most importantly the final outcome of the remodel was outstanding  Not only was everything completed ontime and onbudget but it turned out absolutely stunning exceeding our expectations  And as the say the devil is in the details and it was the details where the quality of the work came through  It was clear that they do not cut corners  The quality of the work was beyond reproach  

In terms of price we didnt do much comparison shopping before going with AHI  Neev impressed us when we initially brought him in so we didnt get other bids for the project  I can say anecdotally the price was very comparable to what some of our other friends paid for similar work  And most importantly the price originally agreed to is was we ultimately paid which is very important to me  No bait and switch   

All in all I would highly recommend Neev and AHI if considering a home improvement project"
5,Excellent home remodeling company They recently remodeled our kitchen and we really are very satisfied with the outcome Eli was our project manager and he was very helpful He also resolved some issued and made a project very simple although it wasnt at all They finished the kitchen within promised time and we are very impressed with their quality of work Thank you American Home Improvement
5,"American Home Improvement just completed our bathroom and patio remodel and we could not be happier Neev Kugel was our project manager and he is an absolute gem He made sure that we were informed every step of the way what to expect for the weekly schedule and always knew who was coming and going His communication was excellent He always got back to me no matter how trivial my question or concern might have been  As this was our first remodel Neev helped us design select and accent our remodel by leading us in the right direction We absolutely love our tile and Neev provided a specific shopping list that allowed us autonomy to select our own designs while helping us avoid unnecessary expenses 

The crew of artisans Neev brought in to do the work were amazing From the demolition crew to the tile guys they were all professional and clean They arrived on time and were courteous and helpful They went out of their way to be sure we were happy with the results and had us view everything as it was completed to be sure we were satisfied Anything that needed to be addressed was handled right away and to our complete satisfaction 

As I said in the beginning we could not be happier with the whole experience Neev and his crew turned an old outdated bathroom in to a serene and relaxing place to be It turned out exactly as I wanted as Neev understood my vision and guided us in the right direction We would not have what we do today were it not for him"

 I asked AHI for a new contractor  They agreed and would keep promising to fix the same issue 4 different people were sent out over 3 weeks and each one didnt speak to the previous one and knew nothing about the project They all agreed that the work by the first contractor was not correct but each crew also contradicted each other Its like they didnt even know who came out before and I would have to explain what is going on
 AHI would promise again and again to correct the issue and each time they failed I have worked in the construction industry on large and small projects for over 10 years  I have never experienced any company with such a lack of communication and incompetence  DO NOT HIRE AHI"

5,"We had a great pleasure to hire and allow American home improvement to work at our house and Mae and the workers for the recent kitchen and guest bathroom remodeling I write this review based on our experience only of hiring them Mickey and Mae did a great job at the kitchen mainly and Mae made it go easy and smoothly The main points according to our experience with them were
1 Very well organized company and structured The workers and Mickey showed up to the house each day during the week and they arrived on time and on the little times that they didnt show up due to things such as deliveries etc  they always gave us notice ahead of time which was important 
2 All the communication between the office Mae Mickey and the workers were excellent They didnt make any mistakes and were able to do everything in good and professional manner We expected to have some errors and delays but I we were just lucky and we didnt have any 
3 Price wise  They were a bit more expensive than the other bids we received but the effort and care they put into our project was well worth it Sometimes you just have to go with your instinct and choosing with them was one of the best decisions we made"
5,We got in touch with American home improvement about doing several things at our house We wanted to have them paint the house replace the windows with a double sided glass and add 2 patio doors that will give us a bigger opening space from the house to the back yard and to rebuilt the kitchen We wanted to replace the faces of the kitchen cabinet doors and to give it a new look while keeping the existing layout of it Isaac was able to provide us with the best deal and our research about the company gave us the final approve to hire them While we worked on the kitchen with Isaac and his people we decided to do additional things at the house that we thought it will be a good idea to do them while we do the kitchen project as well The windows that we Isaac replace for us were a double glass windows with special film UV film In the patio we wanted to have bigger opening that will allow us to be inside the house while getting the feeling of being outside Isaacs people did a perfect job on that too The last item that we did was to paint the house inside and also some touch ups outside Isaac brought to the house several people that came over and worked area by area and making sure that we can live at the rest of the house The work came out better than we thought and we are extremely pleased with our decision to hire American home improvement and mainly to work with Isaac

5,We were having Shlomo working at our house for the remodeling project that we needed to do for a while now He met and sat with us several times of different days planning and describing their process and services Our remodeling project was to do a new kitchen master bathroom master bedroom walkin closet and replacing the old HVAC system with new one Shlomo and Ben managed our project together and they started with measuring the existing areas of the house which allow them to come up with a design a week after Each detail of the project was analyzed and discussed to mainly cover the cost and time frame for each task such as appliances countertops cabinet style and colors etc and the time frame that required for installing the new HVAC system from their subcontractor While close to half of the house was under work American home improvement took every protection they could to cover the rest of the house from the dust and debris so we can live at the house for the time been and they made us a temporary kitchen Each detail and part of the remodeling was supervised by both of them The working team were very professional and skilled from the electrician the plumber tile man and the painter They all worked flawlessly together and involved us with each step of the work Each one of them took pride in his own trade which ended in a beautiful kitchen and bathrooms that we enjoy just by looking at them American home improvement finished our remodeling project on time and a little bit below our agreed budget and we look forward to hire them again We highly recommend American home improvement to anyone considering a remodel
5,We recently worked with Shlomo to paint my house inside and out I purchased this house recently and the house needed to get a fresh look and makeover Shlomo came by the house several times in order to define each space at the house for any color combination and texture in the common areas What I loved about her was that she was able to get a great idea of what needed to be done The color combinations and textures were so impressive and beautiful that the samples of them could prove that immediately From all the samples that she was able to do with her painters it was super easy to imagine how it will look like and the process was very easy In the outside of the house her color combinations made the same effect and this was the killer point that caused me to hire her and the team of painters from American home improvement One of the main problems that I had was all the furniture and items that I had at the house Shlomo was able to solve that immediately by assigning 3 people that came to the house prior to the painters and they moved all the furniture and cover them so it will be ready for the painters to do the actual paint The whole work went smoothly and without any problem which made me very happy and proud at myself that I hired the right company for the job I felt that Shlomo really understood my style and she did all she could to make this on the easiest way and with completely perfection She really listened to what I was looking for and saved me a lot of time and stress If I wasnt hired Shlomo or contact American home improvement Im sure I would still be not able to find any other paint company that could make my house this way
5,We hired Daniel from American home improvement to paint the exterior of our home after using another painting company painted the interior of our home which we were not satisfied with During our meetings with Daniel and with his senior painter we felt that he was honest professional and really easy to communicate with Daniel showed us his past homes hed done in the past which were amazing but he was also open to our new ideas that we saw or got from other places and magazines When you are getting bids for exterior painting you want people who are open to jobs that are creative and maybe a little more time consuming but stunning when completed That is exactly how Daniel is hes allows you the time to walk the property and visualize what it could look like He listens to you and actually paints things the way you want Besides having a wealth of experience and knowledge he is considerate of how a person feels about their home He recognizes that to the buyer of services the outcome of the services mean something to the homeowners Thats a very rare thing to find He gave us a great quote and an excellent timeframe and he stuck to it even when he pointed out to us that we might consider a darker shade around our windows that he had already painted In the end we loved the paint colors and the way he made our house the most beautiful on the block He was so easy to work with he kept his word on everything we agreed on and he showed up every day on time His professionalism is unparalleled as far as Im concerned My neighbors noticed too they had Daniel paint their houses as well I am more than happy to recommend Daniels work to anyone who is interested in having their home or business done He is awesome

5,"This year we purchased a fixer on in a community near our main house We have completed several remodeling projects over the last 20 years all gradually more powerful and all as an ownerbuilder Since this was the most challenging project we decided to go with a company that can design and do the actual remodeling rather than hiring an architect and then searching for a bid from general contractors We thought that we can have a bigger effect on the design and to create an efficiency by using a good team to reach the milestones together and shortening the process Michael from American home improvement has verified to be the perfect choice for us and he was able to start the work immediately after we closed escrow We worked hand by hand in the initial design stage using 3D designs floor plans and elevations drawn by Michelle presenting to us several choices and making changes on the way After this process was completed Michelles team produced for us the necessary plans and handled all the permits 
Our contract was in two parts
First part Design
Second part remodeling 
We were very happy and satisfied with the cost of the design mainly because it included a promise of a good discount in case we go with American home improvement for the second part When we decided to hire them for the second part we were so happy with the quality and effort that American home improvement did for us that the discount was not that important no more Michelle earned the additional benefit This was a large project so keeping a sharp pencil has been critical in establishing costs within the budget Michelle worked closely with us and allowed us to save the cost by making the project possible It has been only three weeks since the remodeling was completed but our years of experience in remodeling we can see that our decision was well made No struggle was wasted and there is no doubts about all the different teams of workers that worked on this remodeling"

5,I never imagined that my kitchen remodeling can be completely very fast and in a fairly price Mickey and Elad were honest the whole time consistent supportive and just easy people to deal with Before hiring them I got several estimates and they were all higher than the one I got from Mickey Their estimate also included more things than the other contractors such as higher quality of materials and home automation features such as outlets lightings and thermostat As part of the remodeling Mickey was able to give me great suggestions on what I can and should include into the design of the kitchen and into the final product I am very satisfied with the whole thing Mickey went with me to his local vendors where I purchased the items I needed for the kitchen flooring tiles countertops handles back splash and more  I cant say enough good things about them
5,I am very pleased with the work that was performed by Mickey and his team A friend recommended me to hire American home improvement for my house remodeling after he heard about the problem Im currently having with the contractor that I just hired for my house in which caused me several problems at the beginning of the remodeling After I called their office Mickey called me and came over to my house the next day checked and reviewed the work that was done and what still need to be completed while focusing on several problems that were caused by the previous one  Few days later he came back once again and presented to me his complete and fairly priced estimate on the entire work that still needed to be done in order to finish it After our lawyer took care of the other contractor I went ahead and hired Mickey to step in and finish the work Mickey started to work few days after and his team came over to the house and started the work Mickey came over the house each day to supervise the workers and to make sure that everything is going according to the plan while oversee the workers He even did some of the work himself and the work was performed in a professional way quick polite and professional I am very happy with the entire remodeling job of my kitchen bathroom entry dining room and bathrooms and I strongly recommend them

5,Our remodeling project started with the wrong company that we hired for our second story addition and a complete first floor remodel on our 1100 sqft house When this happened we left with a house that was unlivable The walls were out of plumbing pipe beams were missing and in a total complete mess One of our friends recommended us to hire several companies that can come and finish the work but in the end we felt that this will cause more and more problems As our search kept going we came across American home improvement and when we met with them at the house we spoke to Daniel and told him what we want and if it can be done Daniel came back to us few days after with a plan on how to take over and to complete the work so we can move in and start to enjoy our new house While Daniel and his team did their plans and suggestions we did more and more research about them because we wanted to be sure that our house will be completed After all of our additional meetings with Daniel We decided that we will hire them and we went forward with our remodeling project Daniel and his teams of skilled people rebuilt our house in a better way than it should have been done from the beginning He was able to combine his skills and vision in order to deliver outstanding product The house came out much more beyond our expectations He visited the house on a daily basis and managed the crews on top of ordering all the materials and scheduling all the subcontractors that worked at the house as well Now that the house is complete and we already moved to the house we can mention that our house is the evidence that they know how to take any remodeling project and to complete it while making the clients happy and without any stress American home improvement price was very reasonable for the work that they did on our home We truly hope that no one will have to go thru our first experience but if they do than they need to make sure to hire the right contractor that will be able to complete any remodeling project American home improvement is a company that I would hire again without reservation

We adore the completed remodeling every day since it was completed a month ago We found American home improvement on the internet and we asked them to meet with us about in regards to the kitchen We were fascinated with their knowledge and design ideas While they prepared the proposal Ziv came over to the house more than once and meet with us before we signed the contract Once we started the work we valued his capability to manage the project They met with us at the cabinet makers shop where we saw several cabinet Designs and they assist us with all the details Ziv did a great job with all his communications with us and with all the other people involved Ziv and the whole crew were friendly and great workers They followed through on all fronts and exceeded our expectations We are very happy with the final outcome and give our highest praises to American home improvement"
5,After a big research that we did that included meetings and interviews several of them we ended up hiring American home improvement Isaac was assigned to us as the manager for the project and the supervisor for the crew He was professional and straightforward with the costs His communication skills were great and he was available for us to answer all of our questions and ideas This showed us how he was passionate and eager to get the job right and not below than perfection After Isaac presented us with the designs we set and run numbers to see how can we fir everything within our budget Surprisingly enough Isaac was able to fit 90 of our vision into the budget so the decision to go ahead with the work was finalized and set More than that American home improvement was able to share with us the cost of the design which made it much better for us because we could add more items to the remodeling Our remodeling project was to renovate the entire kitchen and to replace all the appliances and flooring We want to thank Jacob and the rest of American home improvement for everything they did for us
5,After a long time of research and interviewing several companies I hired this company to do the work The work started with several meetings with Mickey and we spoke on what to do and how to do including the styles relocation of the refrigerator and the time scheduling Mickey managed this whole thing and he had his crew working each day while reporting to him about their progress The first week of work was demolition the old kitchen and prepare the space for the installation of the cabinets During the whole work we had no problem with them or with the communications between us to Mickey or his office Im happy with the new kitchen and with the work that they did
5,I had a very good experience working with American home improvement I worked with a Shlomo who was my project manager and he was very resourceful and skilled person When I met with him he brought several samples of similar projects that he did recently and he shared with me many ideas that could fit to my remodeling while he was very focused to what I wanted During the second and third meeting that we had he went over with me on all the details of the work and even brought a digital design of how the new kitchen will look like after the remodeling The final kitchen remodeling was exactly like the design he had designed The cost of it was fair and good and I never got the feeling that he is trying to add more money to the work or by making any short cuts They had very skilled working crew as well and they were able to complete the kitchen remodeling in a very fairly time
5,Excellent job American Home Improvement has done an incredible work remodeling my kitchen I could not be any happier with the work done It completely changed the look of my house I highly recommend this company
5,"Working with Shawn was great after visiting their location and meeting the  staff I felt very comfortable with my decision to remodel

5,"We chose SW Kitchens to renovate our guest bathroom  This extremely small bath had all original fixtures dating back 34 years  We began the process in October 2021 by visiting the Longwood design center  Later we called to schedule an estimate and they paired us with Sarah  From start to finish on this project Sarah has been amazing  Since this was our first remodel she walked us through the entire process never hesitating to answer all our questions  

She never tried to persuade us in any one direction on colors tile or fixture selection  Being new to this process we would ask for her design opinions and she was always honest and upfront about each item  Sarah corresponded with us on multiple occasions throughout the life of this renovation to ensure all was going as planned and to inquire about any of our questions comments or concerns  

Throughout the life of this renovation there were a number of contractors who came to work on this project  plumbers concrete cutters a framer tile installers painters drywall installers electrician threshold installers and delivery personnel  All of these contractors were highly skilled in their field  All the contractors on our project were very respectful to us and even cleaned the work area before leaving each day  

Our renovation took three months from the start of construction  In all a total of 35 days from the first home visit to the last walkthru  We are so extremely pleased with all the quality work which has been done throughout the course of the project  We have a beautiful guest bathroom to enjoy for years to come    

Sarah was our rockstar  She is so kind patient and puts the client first  She is easy to talk to and discuss ideas and appears to really enjoy her work  We will definitely request Sarah for our next renovation"
4,We recently finished our master bathroom remodel with Sarah Kraus and now were starting on the guest bathroom Sarah was fabulous In addition to her detailed design work Sarah was patient kind and responsive to emails and phone calls Best of all she was an advocate for us when we had workmanship questions or concerns Thats the primary reason we chose to work with her again
5,We just had our first experience with remodeling our kitchen and SW Palm Harbor did not disappoint Shirley Aguilu project designer and Steve Cota superintendent are outstandingtheir knowledge guidance and patience throughout the project made the experience very pleasant We had many questions since this was our first remodel and they were friendly trustworthy and responsive Everyone including the contractors and installers had an impressive attention to detail and their workmanship was top notch We are so thrilled with the end result and highly recommend them
1,We hired them Feb 2021 to remodel two bathrooms and outdoor grill Absolute disaster Attached is what our master bathroon looks like now April 2022 We have finally come to the point where we had to make a claim against our insurance Beware of this company Our designer was Sarah Kraus Never saw her after the demo The first GM for the job Brian Pop he walked out right after everything was demod The second GM Pete Coffman was just as bad Actually caught them trying to cover up water damaged wood caused by them using cheap materials They hung up towel racks with just screws not anchors Towel rack fell down during first use Seriously BEWARE We have water damage and a bathroom still torn up after more than a year
5,I recently finished 2 bathrooms with SW in Palm Harbor Florida  Kirsten Phillips was our designer and Mike Frary was the project managerGC  They were fantastic  SW has an app that allows you to know exactly what is scheduled each day what is planned and easily connect with the team  All of the subcontractors were pleasant respectful and helpful I am sure it wasnt easy one bathroom is on 2nd story one on 3rd story I had a vision of what I wanted shared that and pictures with Kirsten and she helped me through all of the processes  I picked out things that I knew I wanted and she helped guide me in areas I was unsure  We built the house 20 years ago and kept putting off doing the bathrooms  Now I am so happy I should have done it sooner  I highly recommend SW they were fantastic to work with  And huge thanks to Shirley A who helped set me up with Kirsten to keep personal friendship and business separate
4,SW Kitchens did a great job with our kitchen renovation We have a small kitchen that was not in the best shape and we were really looking for design solutions to create more useable space without changing the footprint of the kitchen Sarah was our designer and really listened to what we wanted and did a excellent job designing our new kitchen She also provided us with many options within our budget so we could get something that fit our aesthetic without breaking the bank The only issue with the whole process was with our backsplash tile but Sarah and our site supervisor Adam listened to our concerns and worked to address the problem so that we were happy with the results
5,My wife and I were very pleased with the professional experience we had with S  W Kitchens Palm Harbor  The designer Shirley Aguilu provided excellent ideas listening to our ideas and producing a kitchen renovation plan that encompassed all of our requests  The team including Shirley Steve Tony and Amber were on top of all aspects of the complete kitchen renovation  This included frequent contact to ensure the job was being completed and ensuring all segments installing floor tile cabinets laundry room countertops backsplash plumbing and electrical work were correctly completed  We highly recommend S  W Kitchens Palm Harbor for their work
5,All we can say is WOW  SW Kitchen did a fantastic job renovating our kitchen The difference between our old kitchen and new is like night and day Our kitchen was old falling apart cabinet doors not closing bowing shelves and poor lighting  Lindsey Schwartz our Project designer was great to work with She guided us through choosing cabinets flooring backsplashes and every detail of our kitchen makeover  She pointed out less expensive choices although we did not always listen and different options The demolition and installations teams were all very professional and courteous They always let us know what they were going to be doing and when  We highly recommend SW Kitchens
5,SW Kitchens does fantastic workfrom the design all the way to the punch list They were perfectionists with our home Our designer Laura listened carefully to our needs and came up with a beautiful design She gave us just enough choices that we felt like it was our personal design without being overwhelmed by selections We remodeled our kitchen master bath and guest bath and we couldnt be more pleased with the results We feel like we have a custom home We fell in love with our construction crewKevin Steven Scott and Brian along with top notch subcontractors They were meticulous about their work and took care of every tiny detail They were professional and friendly too We felt very comfortable having them in our homewhether we were at home or away We have recommended SW to family and friends
5,Our Kitchen  Fireplace were very out dated  We had heard good things about S  W Kitchens so we went to check them out  Our first impression was great  We met with Designer Amy Downs and was very impressed with her knowledge  experience  She has amazing design ideas  Signed our contract  we were ready to start  We then met with the contractor Davin Johnson  He was also very experienced  professional  Renovations can be a bit stressful but we new we were in good hands  Davin always updated us as to what was happening and when  We got finished before our due date  We cant thank S  W Kitchens enough for our beautiful transformation  Oh yes and we got our house professionally cleaned too the team was amazing  My house was spotless  We would definitely use them again
5,Victoria Pratt was an outstanding partner and provided a level of customer service that I truly appreciate  She was friendly informative and helpful while we made our choice of wood countertop  I first went online to find an outstanding butcher block or wood countertop product called the manufacturer of the product and was informed SW Kitchen was their distributor of that product in the Tampa Bay area near our home  Once I went in and started engaging with Victoria she struck me as highly professional informative and knowledgeable about the product and how it would look in our kitchen remodel  Victoria took the time to come out see the kitchen remodel and helped me select a product  She was also there upon delivery of a 200 lb wood countertop and helped me quickly find an expert installer for such a beautiful product  I enjoyed working with Victoria and would recommend her services and SW Kitchen to anyone who asked
5,My kitchen remodel is so beautiful  The project manager Brian  communicated effectively so were kept informed of timelines and next steps Our designer Marilyn listed to what we wanted and helped us create our dream kitchen All of the contractors were very professional and treated my home respectively They even greeted my nosy puppy who had to come say hello to everyone who came to the house Highly recommend
5,"S and W did our kitchen makeover after 44 years of living in this house
I found them to be very professional clean and respectful of our property
I would suggest them to anyone considering a renovation"
5,From the start of the bathroom remodel to the end Whitney at S  W Kitchens took a dream of what we wanted our bathroom to be and made it a reality Our bathroom was original from 1988 and needed to be completely upgraded At the start we scheduled a visit with Whitney and laid out the parts we needed and wanted to incorporate into our bathroom Whitney then helped us to pick out a color scheme and quartz countertop tiles floor lights and accessories After about a week Whitney drew up a CAD design to show us how the bathroom would look like and showed us We immediately loved it and signed the paperwork to get it started Because of the pandemic and wood shortages it took about a month to get all the supplies together for the bathroom Still good if you ask me and then they delivered them to our garage for safekeeping Mike our foreman met with us to lay out the work schedule for the remodel and set a demo date Mike was attentive to our work schedule and our concerns of making sure our cat did not get out Therefore Mike made sure to let us know when people would be coming so we could put our cat in a room All of the people who came to work on the bathroom respected our privacy of not going in the doors that was marked that our pet could be in Over the 6 months of the remodel This was finished on time Mike and Whitney were available for any and all questions concerns and gave updates on everything Our bathroom exceeded our expectations on how it was going to be The new shower is roomier and awesome more cabinet space and the countertops and sinks are spectacular We both are very impressed with Whitney and Mike at S  W kitchens and without hesitation will use them again in the future
5,Excellent work and professionalism Would hire again They worked with us to make sure we were satisfied with all our choices
5,Having our kitchen redone with SW Kitchens has been a complete life changing experience  We own a 100 year old bungalow that had an original kitchen with granite slapped on top of the teeny tiny dollhouse size cabinetry  We knew when we bought our house we would redo the kitchen but had no idea with whom  We stumbled upon SW online and read through the reviews  Larissa designed us the kitchen of my dreams within our budget while thinking of every detail and how we could maximize storage and obtain the aesthetic and type of environment that were so important to me  Our superintendent Christian was excellent through the entire process  The amount of time and effort he put into the construction of our kitchen totally surpassed by expectations  If you are considering a kitchen reno I highly recommend SW for the job and HIGHLY recommend specifically working with Larissa you will not regret it
5,SW completely remodeled our kitchen and two baths  Did it all go super smooth  Not really but what did go consistently right was designer Lacie Rice  She worked with my wife and me from the beginning to the end and helped to resolve issues that arose along the way  We are more than satisfied with the results and cannot speak highly enough about Lacie
5,Total bath remodel pricey and started months later than wed hoped  partially due to COVID and personnel change but once started project manager Davin was on top of all employees and subs were all professional and we are very pleased with final product
5,We enjoyed working with SW Kitchens We built a new house and used them for not only the kitchen but all the bathrooms as well Everything turned out beautiful Mollie was great to work with very helpful  informative Even though things were delayed due to Covid we were in the loop throughout the whole process The installers attention to detail is 2nd to none We are beyond happy with the way everything turned out in our home
5,SW is a five star company  Lacie and Steve were excellent to work with and kept us informed through every step of the process  We plan to use SW for third project to renovate our kitchen  If you have a project go with SW and ask for Lacie and Steve
5,"FANTASTIC Experience We have been working out of our home since March of 2020 so we decided now would finally be the time to upgrade the kitchen to one we had been dreaming of for many years We did our homework read reviews and visited the SW Kitchens Showroom in Melbourne Florida We were greeted by Laura Scott who was friendly knowledgeable professional and honest which made it easy to quickly develop a trust relationship with her Laura ultimately became our Designer and as she gathered our requirements she listened to all of our wish lists and concerns and she shared lessons learned to help guide our decision making She offered excellent suggestions and ultimately created a design that far exceed our expectations and enhanced the layout and function of the original blueprint She also provided quick and timely communication throughout the entire process Laura delivered on every promise she made and she routinely stopped by to check in on the progress and make sure our expectations were being met 

We had a preconstruction meeting at our home where we met the various superintendents and project managers that would be overseeing the job We were provided with documentation that included all of our diagrams and decisions and a thorough timeline of when we could expect events to occur They offered expert advice on what to expect and answered all of our questions They even were considerate of our dogs and ensured us of their safety Our Project Superintendent Vinny Mallo provided excellent communication on scheduled workdays and arrival times He worked closely with the crews and provided thorough oversight The crews demo plumbing electrical cabinet install backsplash tile countertops were extremely professional and provided quality work in a timely manner From the virtually invisible seams on the beautiful quartz countertops to the expertly laid intricate backsplash tile we were so impressed with the quality of work They were always on time and presented virtually no disruptions to us even in our telework environment We were also impressed with how clean they kept the environment hauling away debris at the end of the work days and keeping all of our areas orderly 

Bottom linewe are EXTREMELY happy highly recommend Laura Scott and SW Kitchens and would definitely use their services again"
5,"SW Kitchens brought me out of the 70s My remodel was better than I ever expected and the cost less than estimates I had received from other companies The remodel included removing my walls and ceilings down to the studs After our first meeting my designer Sarah Kraus knew exactly what I wanted and needed She went by my color schemes and chose the cabinets tile backsplash and lighting perfectly I love the results  
My supervisor Brian Pope responded to my calls and any questions I had immediately  I felt he went over and above what was expected of him Both projects were done on schedule and my home was kept as clean as possible while the work was in process I now have an open floor plan and a beautiful efficient kitchen and master bathroom I would highly recommend SW Kitchens and especially Sarah and Brian Thank you for my beautiful finished project"
5,"We wanted to update our kitchen and laundry room We wanted to replace our builder grade cabinets and granite counter tops with high quality cabinets with better organization quartz counter tops and slab backsplash I spent a lot of time planning my dream kitchen and laundry room Right down to the last detail We also needed new sinks faucets and pendant lights One of the biding companies expected us to source these items our selves What a pain That was one of the main reasons we chose S  W Kitchens and Bath 

The other reason we pick S  W was after meeting our designer Lacie Rice She came to our home and took measurements and listened while I laid out my vision She made the process so easy I met with her several times in the showroom in Tampa to shop and design She found everything I wanted She even matched the outlet covers on the island with the cabinet color 

We met with construction manager Steve Cota and Designer Lacie for a final walk through of the plans and discuss the process Everything was explained thoroughly The estimate and final contract were meticulously detailed We could see where every dollar would be spent

Every team demo plumbing electrical drywall paint cabinet install and counter fabricator worked hard They were respectful and tidy Every step of the way Steve and Lacie were accessible The back and forth communication was excellent The permits all passed with no issues They even sent cleaners before my house guests arrived for a holiday weekend

The quality of the Omega cabinets are excellent The color is perfect The Cambria Quartz counters and backsplash are beautiful The kitchen and laundry room are much more functional now too Everything looks exactly how I had pictured in my mind We couldnt be happier with the results It looks amazing"
5,We are so pleased with the total kitchen renovation we recently completed with SW Kitchens in South Tampa We literally demolished our original kitchen removing walls going all the way down to the studs and built a brand new kitchen Our designer Larissa Hicks and her design assistant Gina Cerimele were able to take our basic kitchen ideas and design the perfect kitchen for us The design process was very collaborative and at the end they were even able to come up with some creative solutions to keep our project within our budget The construction phase went very smoothly When we came across a load bearing beam in an unexpected place the team quickly adjusted the design plan with minimal cost incurred Mike Frary was our construction supervisor and he did a great job keeping us informed and the job on schedule I highly recommend SW Kitchens and designer Larissa Hicks for anyone who is doing a kitchen renovation
5,SW Kitchens did an amazing job on our kitchen and bath remodel Greg Flassig was our designer and he did an amazing job Also Pete Coffman worked with us to get the construction done He was great at explaining everything as well as promptly answering any questions we had Both were there for us the entire time The crew did a great job Thanks for a great job
4,"We had our master bath remodeled  It took a little longer than expected for the project to be completed  Part of the delay was due to the shortage of building materials not SW Kitchens fault  The Kitchen  Bath Project Designer Sarah Kraus Bartelson and Super Intendent Brian Popp were helpful efficient and easy to work with 

We love our master bath and this company has our recommendation

5,Our new kitchen is stunning The whole experience was so well organized from planning choosing materials and construction completion Our designer Mayerlin was very helpful and responsive SW stayed true to budget and on schedule All of the contractors who came to work in our home were on time dependable professional and very clean I will definitely use SW again Highly recommend
5,In one word AWESOME  I hired SW Kitchens to remodel both of my bathrooms and my laundry room in a condo that I had just purchased  I have done some other renovation projects in the past and I was concerned that they wait until all your materials are in stock before they start  But now I totally get that concept  There were delays with a few items and I wasnt waiting around in a demolished house  Demo started once everything arrived  Savana Dale Kevin and the rest of the team did an amazing job  They were kind and courteous to me  And clean neat and respectful of my home  If a problem came up they fixed it immediately  They finished a week early and stayed on budget  When Im ready to do my kitchen they will be my first phone call  I would highly recommend SW Kitchens for any remodeling project
5,It was amazing to see my design come to reality in this kitchen renovation The SW kitchens team was  so amazing  My designer Sarah Kraus and my construction Superintendent Brian Popp were so professional and stayed on to of creating the specks details and scheduling all the different contractors and inspections in a smooth manner They really hire excellent subcontractors that really know their specialties very well They all cleaned up their  area very well after each job  protected the furniture and floors very well and were careful not to damage their surroundings They subcontracted Zolt Granite for the quartz and they too did an excellent job The only 2 drawbacks I had was that I went into contract after Thanksgiving 2020 and the project did  not commence until the 6th of January 19 2021 Luckily the project was completed in 4 weeks The other concern is that they were a lot more expensive than we thought but they really provide quality work so that really counts
5,We engaged SW Kitchens to assist with renovating our kitchen  Our project was relatively small  It involved replacing the existing granite countertop with an quartz countertop as well as making alterations to the configuration of our counter  SW also performed ancillary work such as replacing our kitchen sink and faucet  They also replaced the countertop and sink in our laundry room and make some modifications to enable our dryer to fit properly  Laura Scott was our designer and she remained involved throughout the project to ensure our satisfaction  We were impressed by Lauras professionalism as well as by the quality of SWs work  We were provided detailed plans for our project which the various tradesmen followed to a tee  Our project was completed efficiently on time and with minimal disruption to our home  SW expended a lot of effort on detailed finishing to make sure that every aspect of the countertop as well as the existing cabinetry was perfect  We would highly recommend SW Kitchens for any home remodeling need
2,"The full review is too long for houzzs submission field Here is an abbreviated review

We had several problems with SW and I could not recommend them as a premium service

They mismeasured our kitchen from the start and didnt catch that error until months into the project We had to redesign the kitchen on the fly and they dont seem to take responsibility for the fact that we did not receive the kitchen we ordered

They are clearly accepting more work than they can handle and their workers are exhausted and distracted This led to several errors My full review has a page worth of bullet points as the errors were numerous and costly

They damaged expensive materials and left us to find the problems There are finish issues that remain to be completed and I have been waiting nearly a month for any answer to my ongoing issues

This project also took months longer than the original completion date

Our foreman quit our project any further repairs pretty much finished once they got things nice enough for a pretty picture

Some of their premium products are already having issues with coatings coming off and blemishes from install that were never repaired

They are a mediocre service charging a premium price"
5,We selected to use SW Kitchens in Longwood after reading all their reviews and completing a consultation meeting with our designer to complete the total remodel of our kitchen  3 bathrooms in our home Considering that we had started this big project in late Februaryearly March 2020 prior to Covid19 we are very happy with the final results and end product and design The whole remodel did take longer than expected and there were a few delays  hiccupsbut over all we love our new kitchen and bathrooms Sarah our personal Designer was an instrumental part in the entire process and a joy to work with She was professional openminded in our vision creative and understanding to what we wanted in our home regarding design  specific efficient functional needs for our familyalso all while keeping our budget in mind without compromising quality and design Robert our General Contractor was experienced  knowledgeable and also was pleasant to work with and was in communication with us and the entire team Our entire SW project team Sarah Robert David Kevin  Craig were professional and great to work with We are very satisfied with the work performed and look forward to enjoying our home with family  friends Thank you to our SW Kitchens Longwood Team for bringing our longtime vision for our kitchenbaths remodel into a beautiful reality It was all well worth it  Dan  Tiffany Marcos
5,SW Kitchens Melbourne proved to be a firstclass company to address renovation of my master bath which was damaged following a lightning strike at my home  Because the bathroom had been completely gutted ceiling drywall cabinets the challenge was to salvage as much of the original custom cabinetry fixtures etc using my own contractors plumbers electricians cabinet installer etc and then replace my countertops and vanity sinks for an updated look and style  From the moment I entered the SW stateofthe art showroom I was impressed with the array of choices and quality of products  More importantly I discovered that designer Laura Smith is worth her weight in gold   Laura carefully listened to my needs and guided me every step of the way  After her visit to my home we selected the Kohler sinks and the perfect Pompeii quartz Valley Sand with copper veining to compliment my existing maple cabinets and Plantation Shutters  As an added bonus due to her prior background in working at a plumbing showroom she also advised me of drain assembly parts needed for my existing faucets and provided other helpfulhints for the rebuild  She was able to schedule countertop installation within a short timeframe far more quickly than other Melbourne fabricators  Throughout this project Laura communicated frequently with me and was professional pleasant and caring  I am delighted with the results
5,Back in January we started the process to renovate our main living space focused around our kitchen we delayed construction some as we wrapped our heads around workingschooling from home in MarchApril  Starting in June the construction made an already hectic summer that much more interesting but in the end it was totally worth it  working from home postrenovation these last couple of months has been that much more enjoyable  Heres a few pics of before and the professional final shots  Anyone looking for a recommendation S  W Kitchens was so great to work with

1,We were excited to begin a remodel of our outdated kitchen laundry room dinning room living room and office and decided to use SW Kitchens even though the price was considerably higher due to their promise of excellent service and customer satisfaction That was not the case at all There were problems right from the start with broken promises incorrect measurements a breech of our bank account information involving the police department due to our paperwork and personal check being dropped in the street wrong materials ordered and delivered poor workmanship damaged and incorrect cabinets incorrectly fabricated granite damaged and destroyed new appliances workmen not showing up when promised the list goes on and on Its been over a year since we first met with the designer and over nice months since the gutting of the area first occurred and we are just now getting the final replacement cabinet doors of which one was still blemished Our remodel has been the laughing stock of our neighborhood and we will be finishing parts of the job ourselves This has ended up being what we call The most expensive doityourself project ever Even with the overall design being very nice we see constant reminders of how badly everything progressed
5,When planning to remodel our kitchen we never thought that our Dream Kitchen could come into fortition this AMAZING Sarah Kraus literally saw our vision from the minute we started to talk  She listened to our ideas was attentive to  our needs and circumstances thoughtful in not only the work she does but goes the extra mile to get to know the client  organized as well  if you were to request a copy of anything she has it readily available  This process really does set the customer up for true comfortability during the crazy process of redesigning a kitchen  The time line presented was reasonable and finished well around the time given  The team that worked with her Brian_ Project Manger David carpenter and the other fields contracted in to assist with the job were always professional and considerate  The kitchen design is beautiful simply breath taking  Every detail we discussed and designed were delivered The craftmanship that was taken into our stair railings is UNBELIEVABLE  They brought our Pinterest idea to life with of course a some designing ideas from Sarah   We have done many remodels with contractors and this by far was our best experience  I highly recommend Sarah at SWKitchens  She is very talented and TOP NOTCH

5,"My wife and I are extremely satisfied with services provided by S and W Kitchens during the complete remodel of our master bath From design to completion Sarah was accessible and attentive during the entire process Was available for unscheduled site visits to verify design changes and the always unexpected issues by providing on site communication with the installers and stayed touch through the process Most importantly the result came out the way we wanted In many remodels the work can end up being what the contractor wants Sarah listened to what we envisioned A special thanks to Robert Ungavarsky the superintendent for the project for  handling and providing recommendations for issues as they came up and for the addons we unexpectedly came up with
We would highly recommend Sarah and her team at S and W"
5,"My husband and I recently undertook a major renovation of our kitchen master bathroom and guest bathroom  We were extremely fortunate that we selected SW Kitchens as our partner in this renovation

Christina our designer was brilliant in understanding our goals and worked closely with us on color schemes tile patterns kitchen appliances kitchen island space bathroom hardware and more  From day one of demolition thank you Tony to the final day about nine weeks later Mike Christina and everyone that worked to make our dreams come alive were exceptionally competent responsive professional and friendly  At the conclusion of our project our kitchen and bathrooms were dramatically more beautiful and highly functional than we had imagined possible in our dreams  

When you partner with SW Kitchens you collaborate with true experts  I simply cannot adequately describe how well everyone but particularly Christina and Mike worked with us on all details adjusting work schedules and projects within projects to come to completion smoothly without glitches

We also enjoyed this renovation project  all of the people involved were amazing to work with  Anyone with a dream in mind would do well to contact SW Kitchens to see that dream be realized

diamond in the rough  The only thing it had going for it was the lovely trees in the front yard enough acreage for the horses and a move in ready barn  
The day I walked into S and W kitchens and met Laura Scott was my best day since moving to Florida  My kitchen and the rest of the house was not functional and so so outdated I explained my dilemma to Laura and thanks to her positive attitude she said she was up for the challenge  And what a challenge it was  Not only was the existing kitchen design a challenge I had already bought the new appliances for the new kitchen  The transformation from old dark and outdated kitchen to a new bright updated and perfectly designed kitchen is amazing  Laura is an outstanding person a designer  She is the best along with the rest of the S and W Kitchens crew  
Our kitchen is perfect  George and Jo Rosenhauer"
5,My wife and I are extremely satisfied with the entire scope of services provided by S and W Kitchens during the complete remodel of our kitchen From the initial design to the final cabinet trim Sarah remained accessible and attentive during the entire process This included but was not limited to effectively dovetailing our vision with her design expertise site visits for design consultation and measurements and subsequent verifications prior to ordering on site communication with the installer and staying in touch through the entire process From working with us to find the perfect slabs for the counter tops to helping us select our appliances we highly recommend Sarah Kraus and her team at S and W
5,We had a total kitchen remodel done by SW Rosemarie Szedula was our designer she did a fantastic job from start to finish She was ever present and kept everything on time and on track Her design and features were wonderful she had many great ideas that we love
5,"We recently had a bathroom kitchen and bar area renovated by SW Kitchens We entered a project of this scale with some trepidation but overall the whole process went smoothly and we could not be happier with the outcome  Designer Lindsey Schwartz and superintendent Dale Thomas were diligent in the planning of the project such that each aspect was scoped out in detail before they started
Lindsey was always a pleasure to work with knowledgeable about overall design elements as well as available products and always responsive to messages She was able to guide us through making style choices without imposing her personal preferences Dale was always on top of the project available to meet to discuss details and had the knowledge and foresight to avoid problems that might occur 
All of the personnel including the construction workers were diligent and courteous 
All in all we are incredibly pleased with our renovations both aesthetically and from the quality that went into them We would work with SW again in a heartbeat"
5,S W are wounderful people to work with They are extremely professional we did had some minor problems but they took care of any problem that popped up  They did suggest an appliance person that i used and they are helping me where the appliance company wont Not there fault The appliance company has some deal with a warranty company called dish do not use the dish warranty But again Dale and Mike are awesome to work with
5,Roisin Wong our project manager at SW Kitchens was simply fantastic She guided me through the entire process of renovating our kitchen from start to finish layout cabinet selection lighting countertop and backsplash and installation She is professional patient friendly talented and incredibly helpful She knew our budget and gave several options to help me stay within that budget She asked questions and made suggestions based on the way we use our kitchen As it is the most important room in our home she helped me put together a space that is light bright and welcoming Most important she designed a space that completely fits the design of our home I wholeheartedly recommend Roisin Wong
5,I had an excellent goldstar experience with SW Kitchens My designer Fred was outstanding and went above and beyond to strategize ideas for accomplishing my bathroom remodeling goals His creative solutions to my needs were wonderful SW is a first class company that employs first class top notch employees Everyone on the team was professional cordial friendly knowledgeable and fun to work with I enjoyed working with them on a first name basis  and getting to know them a bit I found them earnest and hardworking They treated me not only as a client but a real human I would recommend anyone interested in SWs services to contact them
5,After sourcing many companies and meeting with designers I made the final decision to hire SW for a complete remodel of our very outdated 23 yr old kitchen There wasnt a designer I met that I was more comfortable with then Roisin Wong We met with over 10 local companies and two from out of the area I was drawn back to SW based solely on my interaction with Roisin her compassion patience  level of expertise proved to be the right choice  Throughout the entire project I had my share of panic attacks and once again Roisin eased my fears concerns and Michael addressed any issue or complaints I had Overall the kitchen is amazing the layout gave us additional space something I thought would be impossible Everyone who comes into our home gives us endless compliments as to how beautiful our kitchen is I cant thank SW enough for the professionalism and outstanding quality of work I would definitely recommend their services coming from someone whos had their share of horrible contractors
5,We really disliked our kitchen at one time and decided to do something about that by hiring Sarah of SW who came highly recommended  The transformation to our new kitchen is amazing Not only does it look beautiful but it is very functional and we now have more storage with a very important new coffee station Sarah gave us a kitchen with a purpose and so aesthetically pleasing We have received many compliments We love it and enjoy every second Sarah truly brought our vision to light Thank you Sarah
5,We have done 2 renovations with SW master suite and kitchen plus flooring throughout house and have been thrilled Laura is a gifted designer who just knew what I would love  she was right AND professional down to the last detail  Dale and crew are experts and dedicated craftsmen  I enjoy working with them all and would NEVER consider using anyone else
5,My wife and I heard about SW kitchens from our friends at Real Radio 1041  After doing a little homework of our own it was a rather easy decision to go with them for our kitchen renovation  We werent planning on remodeling our kitchen however due to a leak in our old dishwasher we were forced into the situation  At first we were somewhat concerned with the timeframe budget and the quality of product we would be able to afford  My wife had a vision in her mind of what she wanted the kitchen to look like  Fortunately we ended up working with an amazing designer at SW Kitchens Sarah Kraus  Not only was Sarah able to offer us several highquality options within our budget but she also worked diligently with us to provide an itemized list of the products and services that were in scope for the renovation which was required by our insurance provider  We met with Sarah personally in the SW showroom as well as in our home on several occasions and she worked around our busy schedule to accommodate us  Once the design was completed and construction was underway Sarah made sure to keep us informed on what work would be done and by whom  As with any major construction project there are always a few hiccups along the way  What impressed me the most about Sarah and SW Kitchens was the confident reassurance that they would take on any unforeseen issues in stride and ensure the job was done not only to meet our requirements but also to meet their standard of excellence  Sarah was easy to communicate with by phone email and in person to discuss any concerns  With little to no delay she provided us with a remediation plan each time as well as a followup to ensure any and all issues were taken care of  In the end my wife and I are extremely happy to say that our kitchen is now picture perfect and with the customized personal design our house feels even more like our home A big thanks to Sarah and the rest of the SW team that made it all happen
5,"Our master bath remodel was our second project with SW Once again we are delighted with the results Not only is our new master bathroom gorgeous it is efficient and functional No more clutter on the counter or in the shower Everything is hidden away while still being conveniently within reach The construction team addressed every detail resulting in the flawless execution of the design They were courteous professional and respectful at all times 

We worked with designer Laura Scott as we had on our kitchen project Her approach is collaborative and we knew she would help us bring our vision to life She listened to our needs and desires and then offered fresh ideas that complemented ours We appreciate how she touched base with us frequently from design to completion 

Bottom line we recommend SW and would definitely use them again"
5,"I recently finished a renovation of my kitchen and laundry room with SW kitchens I had used them before for my master bathroom
I highly recommend them It was a very professional job
Of course the process wasnt completely smooth but at every turn they came up with a good solutions to any problems encountered 
Krista Agapito my designer and Pete Coffman my construction manager were excellent Kristas design made my kitchen and laundry room much more functional and beautiful too Pete was great with keeping me informed everyday with what was to happen which I greatly appreciated Pete was also excellent with solving problems along the way
I what definitely recommend the whole team at SW Kitchens "
5,"We have used SW for both our kitchen and master bath We are very pleased with both projects The workmanship and professionalism of all the trades was top notch 
We feel the leadership and involvement of Robert Ungvarsky the contractor and Mary Burkhammer the designer insured a positive experience 
Roberts daily involvement and communication kept us current throughout the process That was greatly appreciated"
5,We hired S W for our master bath remodel after online research Kristin designer  performed a thorough in house courtesy consultation with very accurate measuring We met at their Windermere location for  a 3D no pressure presentation and obtained an estimate Once we committed to the project  we got introduced to Robert Ungvarswky our project manager  From that moment on he was in charge on scheduling and keeping us informed of  day to day progress mostly via txt message with real time pictures  We encountered some unexpected work order changes but remained confident on their ability and disposition of finishing our project and meet our high expectations   We are happy with our final product and reassured that we can always contact them for any questions since they use reputable local companies And high quality materials  Robert showed great professionalism and was available to address all our questions which made the process less stressful I would recommend SW to friends in the future
5,"Review for SW Kitchens WINDERMERE location
Necessary bathroom renovation LAKE NONA to make shower larger with wide door and ability to rollin wheelchair when necessary  Removed tub to expand shower area and elongate sink wall which gave much more storage space  Wasnt planning this project but became a necessary project for medical reasons and couldnt have gone more smoothly  If you are really price shopping this probably isnt the group for you  But if you have enough going on in your life already and want to know that the team is going to do the project properly and not cut corners and be there when they say they will be there then Robert and James are the team for you  You will pay more but I have seen some questionable construction around here but not with these guys  Everyone was on point the design the construction tilers electricians plumbers paintdrywall  If any construction project could ever be considered great this was it  It was a pleasure to welcome every member of this construction team into our home and if it ever becomes necessary again I wont even consider anyone else"
5,"I highly recommend this Contractor  I hired them on word of mouth and theyve done 2 bathrooms in a home which I just sold and we are on our third now in my home
I am working with Shirley and Eric and their professionalism is impressive  Construction is by nature chaotic messy and noisy  They minimized all these factors and I am able to let go and let them handle it every time When it is time to do another they will do it"
5,"SW Kitchens Melbourne FL office in particular is a great company to work with and Laura Scott is a wonderful designer 

I hired them to remodel our 35 year old kitchen and had no clue where to begin Laura walked us through the planning process with great patience and ease and cheerful demeanor beginning with an assessment of what we currently had and what we were hoping to accomplish in the finished design With that understanding of our needs she worked up several proposed configurations and presented them to us as 3D and 2D presentations Then she guided us through the material selection process for color style and mechanical configuration Once we were satisfied with all that she worked up a final plan including a detailed List of Materials and work plan 

During that process we also met with Dale construction lead Together they laid out a timeline for the construction giving us a time window of best case and worst case duration For the most part they hit the timeline as promised and finished within the original prediction window

The work crews were polite and friendly We felt very comfortable having them around the house no security concerns They answered any questions we had while they worked and during the job progress They worked carefully and kept the house as clean as possible by removing construction debris each day and hauling it away no dumpster in the driveway Floors were protected with heavyduty cardboard mats that were taped in place to prevent damage Our hardwood floors came through the process without damage We used plastic dropcloths over everything each day to shield from dust Its inevitable that dust gets everywhere Buy a stock of AC filters and plan on changing them out every day or at least every other day during demolition and early phases of the construction especially if drywall work is going on They can also place plastic sheeting to close off rooms as much as possible but the circulating air carries a lot of dust around the house nonetheless

Measurements were taken of our kitchen on at least two occasions measure twice cut once theory so as to be sure they were correct However we still ended up ordering a special cabinet in one position as the one cabinet was too wide for the location because they ordered the wrong size 

The quartz countertop fits perfectly Alignment and seam work are exceptional I couldnt find the seam until my wife pointed it out to me The quality of the backsplash tile work is also exceptional The installer meticulously hand fit pieces around the difficult areas After the cabinets were installed Laura inspected them and ordered replacement bits for anything that was scratched or dinged or had questionable surface finish They cabinet installers adjusted all the drawer slides and cabinet hinges for proper operation

They had first indicated that they would stage all the materials in their warehouse and then bring them over then we discussed storing them in the garage but we were concerned about humidity issues and bugs but in the end the materials were all staged in our family room We moved everything into the other rooms to make room for the materials It had two benefits first it was adjacent to the kitchen so it made work efficient and easy secondly all materials were under AC and so all dimensions stabilized in the wooden parts prior to installation It was inconvenient for us because of the crowding but it was probably the best solution in the end

It is inevitable that remodeling is inconvenient However SW Kitchens did their best to make everything flow smoothly We are very pleased with the finished result and I easily recommend SW Kitchens and Laura Scott for anyone seeking to remodel their kitchen"
5,The team at S  W of James Robert and Aniko did an outstanding job of design and build with our kitchen remodelrenovation  They managed the entire project from start to finish  They kept us in the loop throughout and the project was on track from the beginning  The final results are incredible beyond expectations and we are very happy  We would recommend S  W and this team if youre considering any type of kitchen or home remodel  We will surely use them again for our next project  Thanks again
5,Thank goodness for SW Kitchens My husband and I had had bad experiences with renovations and contractors in the past and were beginning to think that there was no such thing as a good contractor Luckily we found SW Kitchens Whitney Rutledge immediately understood our style and knew what we were after from a design standpoint She planned out our kitchen renovation for maximum utility and suggested features that brought our kitchen renovation to a whole new level We are thrilled with what she and her team accomplished and we couldnt be happier  We definitely recommend Whitney and SW Kitchens for any project You wont be disappointed
5,"We bought a fixer upper condo on the beach We had heard so many horror stories of remodels gone bad We hired SW because of their great reputation for customer service We were not disappointed Lindsey Schwartz was our designer  We did a complete remodel of master bath and kitchen and minor remodel on the two guest baths She clearly knows what she is doing and was a pleasure to work with We were impressed with the quality of work and how easy it was to work with SW All workers are given  background checks  This was important to us because our condo was not going to be livable during construction Dale the construction superintendent was great He impressed our condo Board of Directors   We needed their approval to proceed so this was important We did not get nickeled and dimed  to death The price in the contract is what we paid Every Friday I received an email from Lindsey with photos on progress for the week and plans for the next week 

 Everyone who has seen our remodel is totally impressed They are a high end remodeler and you will be happy you hired them"
5,Whitney worked with us for several months to find exactly the look we wanted for flooring backsplash paint countertops IT turned out better than we could have imagined Mike managed the construction and was very responsive to our requests and change orders Thanks Mike and Whitney
4,SW Kitchens delivered on my kitchen remake It was a long and tedious process but construction manager Pete was on top of it all When things didnt work out he moved in and got it right Especially the wonderful company The Groutsmith who worked wonders in my   kitchen backsplash tile  Thank you Pete and SW
5,It was a great experience working with Lacie Rice from SW Kitchen in South Tampa   They took great care of us and the end result is a stunning a high quality Poggenpohl kitchen  Recommend SW to anyone
5,We worked with S  W to remodel our master bath  Working with Carol our designer was a pleasure  She made us feel comfortable and valued  Our project manager Pete was easy to work with and kept us updated on the project and let us know when to expect workers on a daily basis  Carol and Pete and the whole S  W team were always respectful of us and our home  We couldt be happier with the finished  project  Would highly recommend working with this company
5,"I chose SW Cabinets to redo my kitchen Shirley and team from GC Mike to all the individuals that performed the many tasks were great and highly professional They kept me informed and as the project progressed Mike even made sure that I had a functional kitchen as soon as they could since this project occurred during the holidays
I love my new kitchen so much Im having them redo my master bath Looking forward to this project"
5,S  W did a great job and we are 100 pleased with our beautiful outdoor kitchen Working with Yina was a pleasure and we highly recommend her  she was always available and totally responsive to all of our needs
5,I totally LOVE the way my kitchen came out  With the assistance of Laura at SW it is my dream kitchen that I waited 21 years for  I love to cook and this kitchen makes me want to do more  I will post pics at a different time  I had my colors in mind but the selection and staff were great  Will definitely use them again most likely in bath room
5,I had been planning and visioning my outdoor living area for a couple of years before finally pulling the trigger I had numerous companies come out to provide designs and quotes to best accomplish my ideas I chose Sarah with S  W Kitchens to move forward with my project because I was impressed with her background and willingness to research ideas that she had not done before The work went as scheduled the job was clean and everyone friendly When the project was complete it was exactly what I had envisioned and I could not have been happier I have been described as very particular and have frustrated contractors on previous projects with my expectations The team at S  W did not bat an eye and made sure that everything was completed exactly to my request I would highly recommend Sarah and S  W Kitchens for anyone that is in the market for an upgrade or an addition to their living area
5,Mayerlin at SW Kitchens was our designer for our kitchen remodel  She was very professional and very easy to work with  She took the time to make sure our needs were met within our budget  Everything was done on time and our kitchen turned out beautiful  I highly recommend Mayerlin and SW Kitchens
5,SW Kitchens redid our kitchen and replaced all our tile flooring in the house  Designer Jaime was patience itself as he helped us select product guiding us to the price quality and styles that we were interested in  He accommodated our schedule for meetings at home and at the show room  Project supervisor Austin kept us informed through every step of the process  He communicated with us every single day most days in person as he stopped by to check on the work  If not in person then on the phone  If I needed to call him he always answered my call  All the workers did great work were polite and efficient  I would most definitely use SW Kitchens again
5,The SW team lead by Krista was phenomenal to work with during our entire process She Mollie and Haleh from the Winter Park location were intuitive creative and had follow through after every meeting They gave clear direction and recommendations Dale their specialist that did the install was professional polite and very talented in making any needed adjustments to  our cabinets Theres nothing better than working with experienced people that actually listen when were investing in high quality cabinets with smart designs I would 100 recommend them for any design needs
5,We had managed several home renovation projects in our previous home and we were reluctant to start another one in our current home knowing the time commitment and the disruptions to your life  As a result we thought we would start with a small project of replacing our kitchen cabinet doors  Our research brought us to SW Kitchens  After our initial meeting and learning they were a full service company we decided to switch projects and move forward with the renovation of one of our guest bathrooms  Once we connected with Lacie Rice in the South Tampa office we loved the entire process  She was amazing to work with and had great design ideas  The SW process was fantastic  Lacie and Mike construction foreman facilitated everything for us from design demo renovations and inspections  Lacie reviewed every finishdetail budget and calendar with us up front  The timeline was accurate and the project was completed on time and within budget  Lacie and Mike were awesome to work with during the project  they were very communicative and were great with our dog  We did not worry about a thing  it was the smoothest renovation project we have ever had  The finished product is beautiful  we love the new bathroom and our family does too  We highly recommend using SW for anyone that is contemplating any house renovations  We will be using SW on our next project  Thank you Lacie Mike and SW Kitchens
5,"We started out with the intention of hiring a contractor to perform a  modest kitchen renovation replacing cabinet doors and countertops but even that proved to be daunting as we needed to manage and schedule each trade separately  Then we found SW Kitchens  SW acts as the general contractor and handles everything from design to renovation and appliance installation 
Our modest kitchen renovation mushroomed into a whole house makeover  we replaced everything in the kitchen including the appliances which we ordered through SW added new wood flooring throughout the house renovated a bathroom added crown molding built out a new pantry and more  
Lacie in the south Tampa office was fantastic throughout the design and construction process  She spent countless hours with us not only in her shop and in our home but also accompanied us to our numerous visits to varied locations to select our countertops plumbing fixtures electrical fixtures etc Eric was the construction foreman on our project and was likewise great to work with  We couldnt be happier with the finished product and would definitely recommend SW to anyone contemplating a home renovation project large or small"
4,"Everyone I came in contact with was professional patient and knowledgeable including the subcontractors Workmanship was good and communication was timely and clear
I would recommend this company as long as u dont mind paying a little more"
5,"When we decided to do a complete teardown and redo of our kitchen we knew we needed a fullservice company that would manage the process start to finish We definitely got that with SW Kitchens  They took care of every detail and gave us a new kitchen that exceeded our dreams and expectations 

We knew we needed a designer that we would feel comfortable working with Our designer Laura Scott listened to us and completely understood our vision She used her design knowhow and considerable talent to pull together a kitchen that is not only beautiful but incredibly efficient as well There is nothing better than function meeting form and she definitely achieved that for us  She was attentive to our project throughout the process checking to make sure all was going well  She went with me to the slab yard and patiently viewed all the countertop options to narrow down the selection  I really appreciated her helpful suggestions and support during the selection process  Picking out the color palette and the various materials for the kitchen was a breeze with her guidance  Looking at the result we would not change a thing 

We were impressed with the SW planning process where no detail was overlooked A great deal of attention was given to planning which we believe is a large part of the success of the project SW provided us with full documentation including all of our decisions plans and diagrams for the crew and the sequence of events that would take place over the course of the project The project stayed on track with only minor delays resulting in a fully functioning kitchen by the promised end date

Our project manager Dale Thomas is highly skilled at managing a project  Not only did he keep the project moving he used exemplary problem solving skills to resolve issues that came up along the way  He elicited excellence from his crew trade contractors and vendors  Observing him in action we came to trust that we were in good hands with Dale and crew
Friends had warned us that a kitchen redo of this magnitude would be a horrible experience  But SW made it as painless as possible Before tearing down the kitchen they moved our refrigerator to the dining room so that we could set up a temporary kitchen to use during construction They were thoughtful of our comfort throughout the process keeping disruption to a minimum The crew was friendly and considerate They cleaned up at each step of the process and hauled away multiple trailers full of debris They hooked up our washer and dryer early on to allow us to do laundry at home as soon as possible  Long story short the experience was far less disruptive than we expected  

In a word SW stands for excellence  We are glad we went with them and would definitely use SW again in the future"
5,I have worked together with Matt Carpenter on multiple occasions now and would highly recommend him to anyone in need of a professional cabinet designer  His projects always run smoothly from start to finish and his ability to incorporate amazing design features is second to none  Keep up the great work Matt I look forward to the next one
5,Just completed a major renovation kitchen bath laundry room and fireplace with SW Kitchens I choose SW because of a recommendation from a friend and neighbor and to avoid all the nightmare kitchen remodeling stories I have heard over the years  SW came through for us and it was a stressfree remodeling project Our SW designer Mary Burkhammer took the time to understand our design goals and vision and added the detail to turn our dream into a real plan and design My husband is a detailoriented engineer and he was greatly impressed by the SW design and build process Our construction foreman Robert Ungvarsky turned the design into a reality  They send master craftsmen across all the trades to complete your project Believe me you will not find this level of craftsmen in the yellow pages Im so satisfied with their work I will be calling SW to remodel my master bath
5,"I am an interior designer in Orlando and I have worked with Matt Carpenter on several of my projects  The experience has been nothing but positive  Matt is easy to work with and creative as well  We have worked on large custom jobs as well as more simplistic projects  The result has always been the same total customer satisfaction and ease of execution  I would certainly recommend them for your cabinetry job

4,Lacie and Eric were great to work with  Lacie was told that I was not a shopper and to select 3 options from which to choose  Everything she put forth was spot on and in keeping with what I was looking for  Eric came and saved the day after a bit of a glitch with the original onsite leader  Eric was able to make sure the project was on track and worked very closely with Lacie to ensure a quality deliverable  I really enjoyed working with both Eric and Lacie They are both very professional and care about doing what is right for their client
5,I have worked with Matt Carpenter many many times over the years as an industry professional He has designed everything from full custom kitchens to display vignettes for my customers   He is an expert in his craft acting as both a very talented designer one of the few who will still hand sketch out a rough design to give a customer a visual and as a true consultant to his customers taking in to account their budget and lifestyle and thinking through all of the little details that will give them their perfect end result  Hes a true professional and a pleasure to work with

5,"Integrated Kitchen  Lake Mary Fl

The kitchen renovation we have been planning for many years impacted almost our entire house  We needed a contractor who would handle the project turn key and deal with all the trades  
The team from SW Kitchens did an amazing job

First and foremost Mayerlin Ferreira our designer was wonderful to work with 
From the day we walked into the SW showroom until our final completion she was fully engaged in our renovation  
She looked closely at our tentative plans and listened to our intentions The design choices that Mayerlin offered made our product selections easy 
Our new integrated kitchen has all the features we desired and exudes extraordinary style  

The project management team kept us informed on scheduling inspections and progress  Considering the magnitude of the work their realistic yet customer friendly communications kept us informed all the way through

Finally the tradeswomen who performed the work were all professional and did high quality work  This project was from ceiling to floor  The drywall paint electrical plumbing tile cabinetry counter top and cleaning people all performed beyond expectations

SW Kitchens was certainly not the least expensive option  
However considering the magnificent results we are extremely satisfied  
We highly recommend SW

Sincerely
John  Janis P"

5,The wifes dream has finally come true Thanks to S  W Kitchens their designer Gayle McCaughin and superintendent Dale Thomas Gayle designed our 33 year old kitchen into a very elegant fully functional space and Dale worked together with the various trades to minimize our down time Everyone was very courteous and accommodating to our needs We chose S  W because of Gayles design presentation Dales quality assurance and the selection of cabinets and accessories Also the numerous positive reviews and that S  W had multiple locations in central Florida
5,I had a design  that was perfect  for a loft place in my home but I could not find a co to build it Just happen to stop in S  W Kitchens and meet a designer named Mayerlin Ferreira She was best person I had found to help with my project She understood me was up front with cost and  it was a wonderful working experience I would use her again for any project  in my home
5,I and my wife Anne  are most satisfied with our  kitchen cabinet project with S  W Kitchens We appreciated working with Sarah Kraus from our 1st inhome meeting with her our style and finish selections and installation experience She answered our questions and addressed each concern The whole experience was a very pleasant one
5,SW Longwood did a fantastic job remodeling my condo I had a basic idea of how I wanted my new kitchen to look Greg Flassigs design gave me more than I had thought possible Greg listened carefully to how I wanted my kitchen to feel and he presented me with options that created my dream kitchen Greg and his team paid careful attention to every detail In addition to the kitchen SW removed and replaced my popcorn ceilings throughout with a knockdown finish They installed new flooring and coordinated with my carpeting company with my painters to ensure a seamless completion I will definitely use Greg and his team again and highly recommend them
5,We absolutely love our bathroom remodels Master and Guest  An outdated space was turned into our own personal spa  Our designer Sarah Kraus was a dream to work with  A complete professional that helped us bring our vision to life making it nicer than we could have imagined  We are busy professionals with hectic schedules  Sarah was considerate of our time and flexible with her schedule  Remodeling can be stressful  Sarah ensured we had a pleasant experience  She has great vision and will help you make the most of any space
4,"I absolutely love my new master retreat  Thanks to the incredible design ideas of Sarah Kraus I have an incredible master bedroom and master bath  Sarah took a 1980s bathroom with a huge tub and tiny shower and redesigned it into a luxury spa oasis  I asked for a wow factor and she delivered  The old tub area is now an incredible shower with a river rock floor quartz seating and beautiful quartz and river rock shelving  The shower wall with the window is framed in a unique tile that brings the beauty of the view into the room  The cabinetry is elegant and functional with a ton of storage  She turned a tiny shower into a linen closet and added a new dimension to the room by adding a barn door with a mirror    The quartz waterfall countertop and shelving are a beautiful finish to an incredible space  Sarah is very nice to work with and she listened to what I wanted and took my suggestions and designed the rooms to my personality  If you are looking to transform a space into something special Sarah Kraus is the person for the job  You will not be disappointed in her artistic creative abilities  I would highly recommend her   
The review would be 5 stars if I only considered the designer and the final product  However since this is a review for SW Kitchens I can only give 4 stars   We had so many issues with our master suite remodel  We went through 3 superintendents and the first 2 were not very organized and did not communicate with us  We would show up expecting to see progress just to find out that things had not been done and no one bothered to let us know  Even with the detailed instruction book we had a lot of mistakes  The tile folks used the wrong grout on the entire floor added a step down into the shower and cut and tiled one wall so that everything was off center   By the time Tim Hobson came into the picture we were weeks behind schedule and completely frustrated  Tim immediately started communicating with us and all of the mistakes were corrected and the job was completed  SW did provide additional work at no cost to make up for the mistakes that were made during the renovation  Sarahs design and choice of products deserves a 5 star rating"
5,"Sarah was magnificent She worked tirelessly to ensure the bathroom design we were looking for translated into exactly what we wanted Her suggestions and recommendations were always with our best interests in mind She maintained regular communication to keep us in the loop and aware of any work schedule changes

Sarah had a great eye for detail and was extremely knowledgeable of all pertinent bathroomrelated products Her suggestions were based on knowledge and not just guesswork 

The finished product is nothing short of a thing of beauty and surpasses all we could hope for We cant wait to show it off

Thanks Sarah for taking the time to work with us You did a fantastic job"
5,changed a shower into a bathtub for the grandkids  great designer and tileman  a little pricey but got an high end quality product
4,"Have worked with Andy Meeder with S  W Kitchens on several 
projects He is a tremendous designer with a sharp eye
A great talent I hope we have many more together"
5,"We were fortunate to have Laura Scott and Dale Thomas create a gorgeous master bathroom for us where none existed before  There wasnt any existing plumbing and the electrical had to be totally redone as it wasnt up to code  We live in an old 1935 house and they turned what used to be a very small 10 x 5 enclosed front porch into a spa like retreat  It definitely was an adventure as we encountered many stumbling blocks along the way as one does when challenged with renovating an old home  You never know what you might uncover including a few extra layers of floors extra layers of ceiling and extra layers of walls  The original design would have been beautiful but because of all the adjustments we had to make the design morphed and developed along the way and it came out even better than the original plan and I wouldnt change a thing or the process that got us here  Laura was fabulous to work with and from the moment we met her we felt like we had known each other for years  She was such a joy to work with and we felt that we were always on the same page when it came to coming up with materials or ideas  She definitely got our vision  I couldnt have asked for a better team  Dale our construction guru was incredible when it came to having awesome and unique ideas that fit perfectly with not only our style but the style of the house  We kept having to change materials and adding and subtracting things and he was always so creative but always keeping in mind the era of the house and the fact that we were trying to stay true to that and we had a great time feeding ideas off of each other with the end result that the finished product was something we can all be very proud of  I cannot thank the team at SW Kitchens enough for not only giving us the master bathroom of our dreams but also for making the experience one we will always cherish

1,Hiring S and W Kitchens was possibly the worse decision Ive made as a homeowner The project was started in December and was to be completed by midApril It is now well into August and the work has yet to be completed I was told by Larissa Berendsen that all the materials would be ordered prior to demolition was I didnt know was that much of what was ordered would be the incorrect size color or style My foyer tile was installed three times before they used the correct tile Bedrooms were all painted the wrong color The wrong interior doors were ordered The wrong interior hardware was ordered The wrong laundryroom cabinets were ordered The glass panels on the custom front doors were incorrect Hardwood floors in all bedrooms were damaged upon installation and had to be ripped out and replaced The kitchen lights continue overheat and cutout after 20 minutes of use On one occasion my neighbors called to let me know that my front doors were left wide open without anyone on site for hours I came home to find my doors unlocked at least five times There is a lot more but this gives you some idea I met with the owner Joe Steenbeke two months ago to address these glitches and he assured me that the problems would be addressed yet two months later I am without a finished home I saved for seven years to afford a home remodel it is heartbreaking to know that I gave my money to people who care nothing about their customers
5,We are extremely pleased with the remodel of our master bathroom  Working with Lindsey and Dale was a pleasure They were very professional and even when we ran into an electrical problem that was not their fault they helped us get the issue resolved and worked diligently with our condo association to help us move the project forward We finished within the budget and love the new look  I would highly recommend Lindsey and SW
1,I hired SW to remodel my master bath  during the initial meeting I was told it would only take 34 weeks then when I went to sign the contract it stated 57 weeks When I questioned the time I was told by the designer its in all our contracts but it wont take that long I promise  Then when the job manager came out to do the first look at the bath I was told it would take the full 7 weeks  I questioned this with the designer and he said it probably would so he lied  We went through not having people show up to having inferior work done  The tub had to be removed three times due to measurements not being correct counter had to be removed due to wrong measurements glass around shower had to be removed due to wrong measurements  Each time it would take another week or two to get them back out It finally took over 12 weeks to remodel a 10X12 bath I called the owners and never received a call back I wrote them and never heard a word I have other issues but will just say I wouldnt recommed SW for any project Im doing
5,The designer Sarah Kraus did an amazing job of helping me design my master bathroom She showed me the whole process from start to finish We went over each product that was going to installed in the bathroom Since this is my first remodel of a room I was overwhelmed with all the steps it takes and the process involved Sarah showed me the process and the steps it takes to do the project Without her help and guidance I would be stressed over the project Sarah is a true professional in that she has the knowledge and the ability to deal with my budget of the project I would highly recommend Sarah Kraus as a designer for either your bathroom or your kitchen design
5,Bill Burke was our designer and he did an excellent job transforming our kitchen into my dream kitchen I would highly recommend SW Kitchens to anyone
5,Could not be happier with S  W Kitchens  Our kitchen renovation is a total success and mainly due to the efforts of our designer Sarah Kraus  She stayed on top of the progress being made every step of the way and kept us informed almost daily  Since this was our first renovation this was very much apppreciated and would not hesitate to contact her again for any future plans  Great job Sarah
5,Beautiful job on my bathroom   Great designer and superintendent  No complaints Left my bathroom spotless  All the workers were top notch  Will definitely use S  W for my next project  Kirsten worked very well with me
5,Worked with designer Lola Gainer and Construction Superintendent Eric Rodeback from Palm Harbor office  They were very professional and great attention to detail  Remodeled a condo kitchen when we were away as this is a second home  New cabinets hardware sink faucet flooring tile backsplash countertops under cabinet lighting and appliances  Completed on time and on budget  Would highly recommend
5,I find SW Kitchens very professional and knowledgeable about their products The prices are reasonable The work is exceptional
5,My husband and I chose S  W Kitchens to design and remodel our 1983 kitchen  I could not be happier  We were treated with such respect and professionalism  Our kitchen cost approximately 77000 dollars and it was worth every cent  Everyone went out of their way to make this experience go smoothly and it did
5,SW did a fantastic job on our kitchen renovation Greg Flassig and everyone involved were highly professional knowledgeable and respectful We were kept informed every step of the way and we absolutely love everything about our new kitchen Would highly recommend Greg and the SW team
5,"My wife and I recently had one of our residential bathrooms totally demolished and renovated We decided to use SW Kitchens because they are local have a reputation for a top quality finished product and have been in business since the 1970s 

Also one of the main selling points for us was the designer Sarah Kraus Sarah developed the layout and basic design ideas She discussed all the menu of products designs prices colors etc and incorporated our preferences into a final design My wife and Sarah worked very closely to coordinate each detail 

Sarah is very thorough She verified all the products necessary for the job both at the warehouse and at our home before the renovation could proceed She communicated with us daily and was always available to us when we called 

The project finished slightly ahead of schedule and on budget My wife and I are extremely happy with our new bathroom SW provided us with a professional team and they did a very professional job for us 

But we cannot overemphasize the value Sarah Kraus played toward making this such a great success She built the foundation with her attention to detail keen eye for design and quickly developing a free and open communications with my wife and me Therefore we give Sarah our highest recommendation"
5,From start to finish I was completely happy with the design team and contract team from the Palm Harbor office Kristin Phillips made my kitchen the amazing centerpiece of the house Thank you guys
5,Bill is very knowledgeable  in all aspects of kitchen design  I am on the radio with Bill quite often on a home improvement show and we have had many great discussions about kitchen design the design process the excellent teams of installers they use etc  Ive spoken with some of his clients and have seen some of the kitchens they have designed that are just beautiful    If you want to speak to the most knowledgeable kitchen designers in town S and W Kitchens is the place to call
5,Greg Flassig designed the renovation of our Master Bedroom bath  We are thrilled with the outcome  We wanted a roll in shower to accommodate our needs in our golden years  Gregs design was both elegant and highly functional  Greg was also very responsive to all of our concerns as construction progressed  Great job
5,We hired SW Kitchens to renovate our Master Bath Sarah Kraus was our designer  Sarah was a joy and pleasure to work with  From the beginning she really listened to our vision our ideas and somewhat lengthy list of desires for our bathroom  She was able to incorporate what she heard from us saw in our way of living and personal design to create a gorgeous functional and unique Master Bathroom that we will enjoy and appreciate for many many years to come Our vision came to fruition with Sarahs amazing skills and artistic flair Truly a dream collaboration Sarah and the whole team Chris the superintendent as well as all of the very skilled tradesmen were there for us through the entire process  There were a few bumps in the road as expected in a project of this size but they responded quickly and did what it took from each of their perspectives to correct or overcome any issues that came up Sarah became a friend through this process and I would not hesitate to recommend her and have her design our next project I would also like to mention that all of the people we worked with throughout this project were first rate and a pleasure to talk to and work with Their skills were evident which shows in the end result We have a great deal of respect for everyone who participated in our project Although slightly more expensive than other quotes I believe it was well worth it as SW stands by what they do and deliver a quality product and service We have already had someone ask if they can rent out the spa
5,I hired SW Kitchens to do a whole house renovation This included the kitchen the master bathroom and the guest bedroom and floors  They did a spectacular job of transforming a pig sty into a palace  I worked with designer Krista and contractor Tim  They made sure everything was done either on schedule or ahead of schedule and on budget If there were any concerns each were easily reached by phone or text and the issue would be resolved post haste
1,Our experience was not a positive one  When we went in for a final review of our plans there were several issues  The designer left out several details that were very important to us including the wrong size upper cabinets which created other issues  We were very clear about what we wanted and the designers reaction was to blame us for making too many changes  We feel changes are part of the process and so many would not have been necessary if our designer would have listened and not continually added their personal preferences into our design  The worst part of the experience was when trying to finalize the design for a 2nd time we were pressured by the manager to make a quick decision  In the end we discontinued working with them and would not recommend them as we feel they were dishonest and did not deliver what they promised
5,"We had a 20 year old bathroom with ugly cracking tile and a jetted tub that was never used We didnt know know exactly what we wanted but knew what we did not want Kristin showed us options we did not realize were  possible  The end result is wonderful The construction went smoothly SW clearly explained how the remodel would progress Our new master bathroom is great
We are currently planning our next renovation with SW"
5,SW Kitchens did a total remodel of my 27 year old kitchen and brought it beautifully into the 21st century My designer Mary Burkhammer was exceptional and was with me in every aspect of the design and construction The SW crew rolled like a welloiled machine during the entire process They were extremely knowledgable professional and dependable This was a big project building up walls tearing up flooring redesigning the footprint adding new lighting and electrical outlets re plumbing etc and it was totally STRESS FREE for me from start to finish My new cabinets are of the highest quality as is everything used in the renovation project Floor countertops back splashes lighting appliances hardware  all top notch  I couldnt be happier with the final results and would highly recommend SW Kitchens to any one who wants a truly quality company
5,"Sarah Kraus from S  W Kitchens designed our beautiful Jack and Jill Bathroom We found them a very professional firm and were delighted with the final product The project was completed on time which was wonderful S  W Kitchens come highly recommended by us

Mrs Rachel Miller"
5,S  W Kitchens just designed and installed my beautiful new kitchen I am very pleased with the final product Everyone is very professional and very quick to handle all questions and concerns And though it was tough at times to be without a fully usable kitchen S  W made the process less painful by staying on track They actually completed the project a little ahead of schedule Thank you project manager Tony I highly recommend them to everyone And kudos to my designer Jean for her attention to style and detail Thank you S  W
5,SW kitchens did my design and remodel of my 23 year old kitchen The design was fabulous and the remodel went perfect Krista from SW did the design and she really knows her craft Very knowledgeable and understands all the different aspects of the construction process She is very attentive and when she is not available she has a very capable right hand person Whitney that is Johnny on the Spot Bottom line They do what they say they will do and they do it well We are extremely happy with the end results
5,"Outstanding We have nothing but positive recommendations for Lindsey Schwartz at Brevard S  W Kitchens

It all began with Lindsey listening to our wishes then moved on to her designing and creating our condo kitchen master bath  guest bath renovation Not only did she listen to what our desires were but added so many great practical and decorative ideas all the time keeping within our budget allowance Lindsey  Kevin visited our condo to get ideas of what we wanted to do for the renovation they spent time learning what we wanted discovering what style kitchen baths would suit us best with our renovation Kevin measured everything to make sure what we decided to do would work for our space  meet our condo building code

 We replaced our kitchen  bathroom cabinets removed some walls replaced  counters sinks lighting mirrors appliances removed all popcorn ceilings replacing with textured ceilings  had entire condo painted With this being an ocean front condo Lindsey designed our kitchen counter with a slight wave along the edge  added wavy tile backsplash to carry on the ocean wave theme using neutral Quartz stone with tiny seashells on top of white cabinets It is just beautiful  quite the conversation piece

Project manager Dale was awesome to work with coordinating the entire project  managing all of the subs plus doing a lot of work himself The subs were all top quality  were all fantastic from the cabinet installers counter templaters  painters electrician plumber appliance installer all took tremendous pride in their work All kept very clean work space  thoroughly cleaned up space each day when they were finished

We felt we were in good hands with our renovation from start to finish Lindsey did not rest until she was sure we were happy with everything no matter how small the detail Not only was she knowledgeable in all areas including electrical plumbing cabinetry along with kitchen  bath design she was a joy to work with We highly recommend Lindsey  her team"
5,We were pleased with the plans SW drew up for the remodeling of our two  bathrooms  Everything went smoothly with the work  SW personnel and contractors went out of their way to see that we were pleased
5,We were looking for a full service company to coordinate the work needed to update our  kitchen cabinets and two guest baths We are very pleased with our decision to work with Nate Schuck our project designer and the team at SW Kitchens Nate listened to our needs provided great ideas and worked within our budget Travis Boley our superintendent coordinated the activities and was quick to respond to our questions The quality of the products and service and the attention to detail was outstanding We had an excellent experience and would highly recommend Nate and SW Kitchens
5,Guidance throughout a stressful kitchen renovation  Excellent choice of cabinets colors  marble and granite  backsplash Professional installation that has held up
5,I contacted SW Kitchens and spoke to Nate  He came to my house and previewed the remodel of our guest bathroom  We had been having major mold problems which drastically affected my wifes health  We got three bids but even though they were not the lowest I was impressed with the way SW personnel communicated with us  We signed the contract to completely remodel the guest bathroom with Nate and set a date to commence the remodel with Nate and the Superintendent on the job Chris Hooper  Because of the problem with mold they moved the work forward and started construction  We were completely happy with the results and we would recommend SW to anybody we know who needs work done  To us first comes dollar cost and then communication  I stressed this to all three contractors  SW was the only company to comply and stay in regular touch with us throughout the remodel  Again Nate Chris and the people that did the remodeling were all outstanding  Everybody that worked on our home was friendly very knowledgeable and took great care in the work they did
5,"My name is Jack Flemm i am  home owner in windermere fl I have had the extreme pleasure of doing two kitchens and three bathrooms with Nate Schuck Each experience was better than the last Nate is a real pro He has an incredible eye for design while always respecting my wallet even when i do not seriously Nate is willing to speak his mind and work with your ideas the first kitchen and two bathrooms were mostly his ideas and the second kitchen and one bath were mostly mine i love them both 
Nate does a great job of making you the customer feel comfortable while under promising and over delivering at the moment i have run out of projects but i will always remember Nate Schuck when the next one shows up You will love working with Nate and his team i guarantee it"
5,Our designer was fabulousMary listened to our needs and planned the kitchen to what we were envisioning  Tim was our project manager he communicated beautifully and was very willing to listen when we had concerns  The cabinets are gorgeous and installed perfectly  We also loved the counter tops beautiful  Everything that was recommended to us delivered  Very pleased
5,The S  W Kitchen designer we worked with Greg Flassig was very conscientious in helping us decide what materials and colors to use in our new kitchen remodel  He gave us plenty of options but did not overwhelm us  He listened to our needs and wants and was able to incorporate some fresh and innovative ideas into our living space without destroying the uniqueness of our home Greg was very personable and patient even when our decisions changed dramatically at the last minute when we added extra floor tile into our family room The whole S  W team worked well together to finish the project on time and they continued to be available when a few details needed to be redone after the project was completed  We felt very comfortable with all of their workers and employees  We highly recommend S  W Kitchens for quality service and distinctive designs
5,We just used SW to add a bathroom and they were awesome They made an addition to the house adding a bathroom in our garage The bathroom is beautiful and they finished ahead of schedule I have a newborn and they were always so accommodating They would call us to tell us who would be there the next day and when they would be there The room was finished several weeks ahead of schedule and could not have come out better We are so happy that we chose them
5,"S  W Kitchens Remodeled my kitchen removed a wall raised the ceiling new cabinets and countertops new plumbing and electric
The designer assigned to me was Kirsten Phillips from the Palm Harbor location She was WONDERFUL She really listened to me I was not present for the construction however she kept me informed every step of the way with calls texts and pictures Everything was finished to my complete satisfaction Kirsten and the others went above and beyond to make sure that I was happy with my new kitchen  I do not have one bad word to say about any of the people involved with my remodel Do not hesitate to contract with this company"
5,"SW completed a massive renovation for me in a most competent efficient and timely manner  Chris Druschel and Tim Hobson were my main contactsadvisorsdesigners and working with them was truly a pleasure  The project was completed on schedule in my absence and with constant feedback and progress reports  The quality of product and workmanship were extremely satisfactory  

I am completely satisfied with the final result and would recommend SW without reservation"
5,Adam from the Palm Harbor location came into our home in Brooksville and enlarged as well as completely remolded our kitchen  We had used Adam and S and W previously so we knew what to expect  Adam and his team were on time and ready to go  Project took less time than expected and came in on budget  Anyone looking for quality work needs to go to S and W
5,"My wife and I were looking at doing a large renovation to our foyer living room gallery moving the kitchen laundry room dining room and two bath rooms We talked to several companies before S  W Kitchens and after meeting with Chris Druschel his ideas the store and meeting some of the management we were sold on SW as the best people to hire 
Working with Chris was a real pleasure and what a great design we as a team came up with  The project once started went very smoothly from start to finish All of the outstanding subcontractors were very professional and Tim Hobson  construction project manager worked the daily problems and kept everything on track The project was finished well ahead of schedule and we are extremely pleased with the quality of workmanship and attention to details that was put into beautiful restoration SW and all of the people involved in this project are highly professional very talented and a real pleasure to work with  
A very special thanks to Chris and Tim for an outstanding job We couldnt be happier"
5,"Lindsey did an awesome job in translating my concepts descriptions and examples of what I was looking for in my kitchen remodel  While modern is not typical in Brevard Lindsey was excited to do a project of that nature  

The job consisted of new cabinets countertops and appliances  While no walls were moved and the basic layout was retained it was still a fairly extensive job  

The entire SW team were very professional and I was always kept up to date as to what was going to happen when  There were very few issues that came up during the project  The communication was always timely  Whether it was Lindsey the job foreman or any subcontractors they always communicated directly and honestly when any issues needed resolving and sought my input in determining solutions  I felt that my satisfaction was their primary goal  

The kitchen turned out fabulous and I would not hesitate to recommend them highly to friends  I plan to update a bath in the near future and plan to give Lindsey and SW my business when I do"
5,"As we embarked on a major remodel of our kitchen and both bathrooms we were quite impressed with SWs design and materials selection We tweaked the plans a bit but only to accommodate our concerns about wear and tear in the kitchen as we use our kitchen a lot SW quickly made some changes in the materials and we were set to go The materials selection process was a breeze SW narrowed down the material selections to two to three choices which for us designchallenged types was very helpful If we didnt like any of the choices they would bring in two or three additional choices  
Throughout the entire process SW was very professional Before any work started we had plans we understood the costs and we understood what would happen if we ran into unexpected snags Enduring a remodel can be challenging but a few things that we really appreciated were
Everything was resolved to our satisfaction There was never any quibbling with anything we were not pleased with 
All workman and subs were very polite conscientious and always cleaned up at the end the dayand when youre living through a remodel thats very much appreciated
SW is very responsive to callsemails
The project was completed in about three months and we couldnt be happier It turned out fantastic We did go slightly over budget however that was mostly due to changesadditions that we made Since the remodel weve had a few little things break or require some adjustment which SW attended to right away no questions asked

We give SW high marks There were no surprises on cost design project timing etc They have a great pricevalue proposition and they are there for you during and after the project So without hesitation we highly recommend SW"
5,Outstanding describes our experience working with Chris Druschel of S and W Kitchens From the design stage through demolition construction and completion Chris worked diligently to bring our unique vision to fruition The quality of the materials and workmanship was of the highest order At no time did we feel pressured to hurry the process Deadlines were met We would strongly recommend Chris Druschel of S and W Kitchens for any project
5,We decided to update parts of our home and met Chris at S  W Kitchens   It was a pleasure from start to finish    We had both bathrooms and kitchen cabinets refaced and quartz counter tops in both bathroom    The work is perfect and we were so happy we decided this year to have the kitchen counter top replaced with the same quartz we used in the bathrooms   It had been tiled a few years ago but after seeing the quartz in the bathrooms we could not resist completing the project by having the tile removed and the same quartz installed   Every thing went so well  jobs completed on time and all involved were very kind polite and skilled    It makes us wish there was more work we could have done
4,"Project consisted of all new wood floors through out the house new granite counter tops in the kitchen new back splash and new appliances

The designer Kristin was very patient with her picky clients and in the end it was worth it She worked with us on finding the right floor grade and stain color granite slabs and back splash design The gentleman that installed the wood floors was second to none for being detail oriented thorough and you knew he took pride in his work The other subs did quality work as well and knew their craft The project manager did a good job of trying to keep everything moving towards completion

I did not give 5 stars due to the lack of communication and it was obvious the PM had too many projects assigned The end result was quality craftsmanship and product"
5,"Chris response to our problem was quickly resolved  In all of our dealings with SandW Kitchens we have been extremely pleased with their professionalism and rapid response to our questions and concerns High quality work completed on time with excellent results  We will use them again on our next project
We recently had an issue with lighting but it was resolved with one phone call  GREAT  RESPONSE AND SERVICE"
5,We hired sw kitchens to do a complete tear down and build up of our 2 bedroom beach condo  Adam Vinson of the Palm Harbor office and his crew did a superb job  They worked carefully with us to consider all the options for flooring paint countertops windows etc and helped us make the proper selections that fit both our taste and our budget  SW overcame challenges with permits condo building restrictions and unexpected structural oddities  The crews that worked on our place were very capable and professional  With the completed job we have a redecorated condo unit that looks fantastic and meets our every need  We are very happy and satisfied and cannot thank SW and Adam Vinson enough for creating such a wonderful place to live  I would highly recommend SW to anyone looking to renovate their house or condo
5,We purchased Omega cabinetry from SW kitchens for our bathrooms  We love the high quality American made product from Omega cabinetry  The SW designers are very knowledgeable about the product and were able to help us customize the layout color and design for our particular needs With their large selection of products that they carry SW staff was able to help us decide on the product that was right for us and our budget The cabinets were delivered to our house in the time frame that was estimated  My husband did all the installation of the cabinetry and SW was very helpful with questions he had during installation  We will soon be doing our kitchen and will most definitely be purchasing through SW Kitchens
1,"We were very excited to remodel our Master Bathroom  It started out as just adding a jetted tub to the space and grew into our Dream Bathroom by completely redoing the walkin shower Vanity top sinks toilet and water closet along with reconfiguring walls  We didnt know that our Dream would turn into a Nightmare  Earlyon in our planning we found a supplierinstaller for the quartz that we wanted to line the walls tub deck and Vanity top and needed a local Bathroom contractor for the remainder of the project  After contacting a few local Kitchen and Bath professionals we decided to contract with SW Kitchens even though their estimate was 4000 higher than any of the others  We made this decision due to our comfort with the Designer and EstimatorProject Coordinator that we dealt with during the detailed planning process SW Kitchens reputation advertizing and the promise of a structured process with the Highest Possible Level of Customer Service  Communication

We were assigned a Construction Superintendent who initially met with us and our Designer to go over the job ALL details of the contract and develop a schedule  Our job was estimated to be 5 to 7 weeks from start to completion which based on our prior knowledge of construction practices we thought was a little excessive but we accepted it

Initially the job started out as promised with daily morning planning calls from the Superintendent which we had requested  There were minor daytoday issues which popped up and were dealt with  We understand that this is normal for construction  However we began to notice a pattern starting with the quality of subcontractors on the job  Next the communication started to drop off  It became a REAL PROBLEM after we made the substantial post demo payment  The Construction Superintendent had all sorts of excuses as to why he didnt call us with a daily update as we had requested  Often he didnt even return our voicemail requests for a callback He didnt seem to understand many of The Contract details or be able to manage the project properly  The Superintendent consistently tried to put the blame on our Designer or others in the Company for his inability to control the job  As our main contact on the job we were told that it was his responsibility to understand our project and Contract completely in order to execute the job  The final straw came when the subcontractor to install the shower floor showed up and was NOT the original person that came out to preplan the installation  They had NO knowledge of the product that we had specified Our Designer and EstimatorProject Coordinator had researched the product thoroughly and knew that it was different from regular epoxy The subcontractor refused to follow the very specific instructions that came with the product stating that they knew epoxy floors  We tried to contact the Construction Superintendent who was not on the job site when ANY of the subcontractors were performing because the shower floor subcontractor started to apply the product improperly but we only got the Superintendents voicemail  So we panicked and called our Designer to report we had a major issue onsite Later we were chastised by the Superintendent because he said we should only go thru him SW Kitchens literature states our project managers construction team members and designers are always available for any questions you may have  When the Superintendent finally did show up on the job he didnt stop the shower floor subcontractor and he gave us his personal guarantee and that of SW that they knew what they were doing and we would LOVE the finished product That wasnt the case  It turned out totally unacceptable with sharp edges uneven coverage and no slope in some areas  At that point we knew that there was no way that the Superintendent was credible any longer and our relationship with him had deteriorated to the point that we could no longer rely on him to complete the project He had taken some shortcuts throughout the project was NEVER onsite for the mandatory County Inspections we had to walk the inspector through every detail and had NOT adhered to the Contract requirements We contacted our Legal Representative and sought her advice regarding our possible courses of action We had to request a new Construction Superintendent and threatened legal action  As a direct result The Director of Field Operations took over our job  A Certified Installer for the shower floor product was retained to chipout and redo it  This time it turned out perfectly  We went over ALL the missed details issues and Contract concerns with the Field Operations Director  He was very professional addressed these items and we were finally able to get the job completed

Its a shame that we didnt have someone like the Field Operations Director to work with our wonderful Designer and Project Coordinator who were both very knowledgeable and professional from the beginning  We might have been spared the painful experiences and anguish The Total Project Time was 12 12 weeks and only then due to getting our legal representatives support and advice not the original 5 to 7 weeks estimated  We can only hope that if there are any Warranty Issues in the future that SW Kitchens will stand by their Warranty  Unlike their advertising we were NOT 100 happy with the overall process and The SW Difference was NOT Simply Wonderful"
1,"SW Kitchens of Melbourne FL were extremely difficult to work with  We hired them to reface the kitchen cabinets and install a granite counter top and backsplash The project manager would not communicate with us and never met any of the deadlines  We would have to track him down just to get an update  It was a fairly small and simple project yet it took over a month to complete not to mention the two months it took from the initial consultation to the project began  

The project manager wound of quitting the company in the middle of the installation phase and no one from the company would return our calls It took a couple of  visits to the showroom to talk to the manager to get the project back on track  During the installation phase the wrong parts were ordered two different times which delayed the project even more  Not once did anyone come to perform a Quality Assurance check of the work that had been done  

Since the installation we have had cabinet doors fall off twice  We come to realize that they did not secure the dishwasher to the cabinet or countertop  So the dishwasher tilts forward anytime the door is opened  We have contacted the manager once again and it has been two weeks and they have yet to send anyone to correct the deficiencies or contact us as to when to expect repairs to be made  

I would personally not recommend this company because they only seem to care about getting paid and not providing a quality product I say this because they would not return our calls and seemed to blow us off during our visits to the showroom  However they were quick to call if they had not received their money"
3,This company remodeled our bathroom this past winter  They have a new location in Tampa and we worked with the new store
4,Kristin did a great job on designing the kitchen She was very helpful in suggesting ideas when I was trying to figure out how to work my cookbooks into the kitchen in my old kitchen I stored my cookbooks across the top of my cabinets and it was very inconvenient  She suggested the open cupboards over my washer and dryer This worked wonderfully  She never looked at my thoughts as no you cant do that but rather what if we did this  She helped get me the maximum amount of storage that I needed while staying within our budget She was able to work my washer and dryer into the design of the kitchen as well
5,We hired SW Kitchens to do a complete renovation of our laundry room  From design to demolition to procurement installation and completion they did a fantastic job all around  Chris Druschel design coordinator and Tim Hobson construction superintendent are creative dedicated and skilled professionals who were a pleasure to work with from start to finish  The project was completed on time and within budget as promised  Tim and Chris kept us informed at every step of the process  While we had high expectations going into the project SW far exceeded our expectations  We could not give SW as a whole and Chris Druschel and Tim Hobson in particular a higher recommendation  We would not hesitate to recommend them to our friends and neighbors or to hire them for other projects in the future
5,Recently had a complete remodel of my 80s kitchen  They did a great job designing the new space and all of the workmen were very professional  The old space was gutted  One window was removed  and the ceiling was raised to increase storage  I now have more storage space than I have stuff  A very nice predicament  I replaced everything in the kitchen except for 2 of the 3 existing windows  I am very pleased with how everything turned out and the time line and cost was right on target
5,Bill is an exceptional designer  He listens to your needs and offers very good suggestions  He is detailedoriented which is really a plus when you know how you want to use a space but not how to make it happen  Bill makes it happen  This is the first part of a twopart home office project
5,We could not be happier with our experience with Finecraft renovating our kitchen and bath as well as overseeing the installation for a new HVAC system  Every craftsman was skillful kind and thoughtful of us as we maneuvered around them over the months of this project  The attention to detail was impressive and the handson approach of George the owner and Vivian the project manager  and Georges first cousin always made us feel totally confident that we were getting our moneys worth  We recommend them without reservation  Maryetta AndrewsSachs and Bob Zeskind  4920 45th St NW
5,I had the pleasure of working with FineCraft Contractors on a full renovation and addition that I designed for a client in Northern Virginia  George Papaheraklis and Vivian made a great team paying close attention to details and quality workmanship It is refreshing to work with a builder who has a collaborative approach and is hands on The client lived in the house during a large project and FineCraft worked hard to make that happen and ensure they were happy with the end result I would highly recommend FineCraft as a topnotch builder to any of my clients and hope to work with them again
5,We really enjoyed working with FineCraft for our basement refresh They were extremely responsive and took great care in making sure our project was done right and on time They do a really nice job setting projects up with a team so you always know who your point person is for questions or concerns during the work They also did a really nice job keeping us updated We really appreciated that as issues came up which they are always bound to do when renovating a 70 year old house that our contractor was always ready with options as well as his best suggestion for how we could solve problems and make it work We will definitely be returning to FineCraft for future projects and are really loving our new basement space
5,Ive had the pleasure and privilege  to work of Fine craft Contractors  for a very long time The first time  Owner and principal George Papaheraklis and I initially contracted with me was in 1987 almost 35 years ago One can immediately ascertain that George has Architectural Training and an artistic eye merely by the way he could anticipate the next design move and and the way he can finesse meticulous details with visually graceful solutions Our Attention to detail and the minutia are often a challenge for many general contractors but George leans into these challenges with a positive attitude and productive energy One particular ecfample was the sculpture above the front door of our Midcentury addition and renovation  Initially a flea market fragment DLAs last minute detailing required stone and steel This could have been vocalized with frustration but instead was met by George Papaheraklis with passion and has become the crowning jewel of the composition A client once heard George saying under his breath that his quest for good construction is life sustaining for him Since we first met decades ago his close knit staff has  grown in both size and professionality One of our mutual projects was of particular challenge However it was constructed methodically and intelligently along with  Vivian who is integral to FineCrafts efficiency stream lined production and can do nature  This was was no small task especially as two prjects they have worked with us on took place in the middle the pandemic Dasha Niko and Patrick who I have worked with personally  are all a part of the caliber FineCraft Contractors brings to the table and table saw
5,We couldnt be more pleased with FineCraft They flawlessly executed a complicated design to create a modern floating porch on our 1930s center hall colonial house All of their trades  including the mason carpenter electrician painter etc  worked together seamlessly and in lockstep to bring the project to life We loved how George and Vivian were always coming by the house on a daily basis to answer any questions and make sure the quality was up to par We always felt like we were up to speed on what was happening and where we were in the process We would definitely choose FineCraft again for future projects and we are ecstatic about the work they did or us
5,I have to say we are completely satisfied with the bathroom remodel It met and exceeded expectations and was long overdue I never had to question the teams expertise or competence which cant be said for every contractor in the DC area We look forward to either working with your team again
4,Great companygoes the extra mile  Very dedicated professionals who do what is needed to make it right Great to work with
5,FineCraft just completed a major yearlong remodel for us in Northern Virginia  We are delighted with the quality materials workmanship and attention to detail  We lived in the house during the work You might question this choice but with FineCraft it worked  We saw the same crewsnot random contractorsevery day  To a man they were friendly courteous and took pains to leave a clean living space at the end of every day  George Papaheraklis was on site every few days troubleshooting improving and explaining what was going to happen and in what order  The house looks great and is easy to live in  We got more than expected and at a fair price
5,Consummate professionals Easy to work with and would recommend these guys to anyone who wants a high quality and professional job
5,They did my addition and were excellent Shout out to Chris who was always so kind and professional and always available when needed
5,Finecraft prides itself on attention to detail and indeed this was our experience throughout the renovation project a kitchen and sunroom upgrade that opened interior space without modifying the exterior footprint of the house To make our lives much easier they built a separation wall between the work area and the rest of the living area and reconstructed a temporary kitchen on the main floor in the living area so we were able to stay in the house during the construction This made a big difference during the forced homebased work due to Covid pandemic The staff left the place in good shape each day before leaving At the end they did not hesitate to come back several times and in a timely manner to complete the details remaining on the punch list We love our new space
4,FineCraft has done two significant projects for us  a major terrace remake four years ago and now a total kitchen renovation  We are very pleased with their workmanship and the ease of our working relationship  On several occasions they have taken extra steps to please us
5,We were converting a two story great room into a second floor with new bedrooms as well as renovating our kitchen and a bathroom  laundry room   With a baby on the way our timeline was tight  no room for delays  and Finecraft not only delivered but exceeded all expectations in terms of reliability craftsmanship and staying true to the estimate   We were out of town for most of the project and were able to communicate effectively with the team via mobile app andor Facetime   Once we were back in the house Rosendo and his team were very respectful and friendly and kept everything clean and responsive to any and all questions or minor issues   Would hire them again for any project   Very pleased with the final result as well as the process  Thank you

5,We hired FineCraft to renovate the basement in our 1958 splitlevel home  It was important to us for the project to create a more functional living space that was still traditional enough to match the rest of our homes interior  They did a terrific job  followed the architects plan to the letter  The quality of the work was topnotch  In fact the WSSC inspector thought the work under his purview was the nicest hed seen  The members of the construction crew were polite and professional  George has a fine aesthetic that clearly carries through to all of the work done by FineCraft The workmen who laid the tile particularly in the bathroom are truly artisans   It is a lovely space and we could not be happier  Id recommend FineCraft to others who are considering a remodeling job

5,"We went through a long process of selecting a contractor for a remodel of our home on Capitol Hill We are so glad we chose the fine people at Finecraft The moment we interacted with them we knew that there was chemistry It was a long project with many customized flourishes that were unique and challenging The Finecraft team did an incredible job and delivered our dream house Their professionalism attention to detail and overall team work made for a stress free journey through the construction If we had to do this again we will do it in a heartbeat 

Thank you to the entire Finecraft team  Specially Jose and Dasha"
4,Enjoyed working with this team Very professional and worked hard to minimize disruption to our family during construction period Quality of work was stellar and communication was excellent
5,This team of professionals has an amazing ability to see what it is you want to create  I have worked with this team in the community many times and when it came to getting a bid on my personal project I knew they would not disappoint us  Finecraft came was on time listened to our ideas and then really looked at what we had to work with and created a plan that would work in our family budget  They also gave us plenty of referral projects to go look at and customers to talk to for references  Its not like here are 3 people its years of happy customers  Their attention to detail and craftsmanship on their projects was what sold us  Quality and excellent follow up
5,Finecraft Contractors Inc is an absolutely firstclass organization Their name suits the quality of their management personnel and workmanship very well They are true professionals in every sense During the course of our home elevator construction and installation project my wife and I got to know the Finecraft management and craftsmen team very well We have only the most complimentary things to say about their courtesy creativity flexibility and project management and execution skills We highly recommend Finecraft Contractors Inc to anyone who is looking for a superior home remodeling contractor
5,Finecraft did a wonderful job on this project  In particular their craftsmanship timeliness and attention to detail were admirable  We look forward to working with them on Phase II of the project
5,We have now worked with Finecraft on a number of remodeling projects in the DC area  They are a highly professional and skilled Contractor that produces quality craftsmanship and on time project delivery  As Architects we have found Finecraft brings value added ideas to the project whether it be product recommendations or if an issue is discovered how to solve it We would highly recommend Finecraft to our clients
5,We hired Finecraft to build our screenedin porch on a recommendation from our architect and overall were very pleased with the project  The quality of work was very good and their team was professional and courteous  We would absolutely recommend them for similar projects
5,Finecraft Contractors is a top quality operation I have done multiple renovation projects with George and his team including bathrooms kitchen addition terrace and inlaw apartment Finecraft has a great sense of aesthetics great attention to detail and the construction site is left impeccably clean every night Thats why I am a return customer
5,"Finecraft contractors is a well rounded professional company in the DC area 
Their crew is highly skilled and the staff has superb customer service Every project we have seen has exceeded our expectations It is hard to find a building company with such high attention to detail Working with the Finecraft family makes your experience enjoyable and gratifying"
5,I have worked on several projects with Finecraft They are an excellent company to work with and have a pleasant and knowledgeable staff that will always make client communication service and quality their to priority
5,Finecraft did an excellent job renovating our garage and converting it into a gym They were prompt in their reply and finished the project in the time they quoted which is huge The price was reasonable and the staff was very responsive throughout the whole process I highly recommend them for any home renovating project and will be using them again in the future
5,I hired Finecraft to handle a gut renovation of an 1890s townhouse in downtown Washington DC The property was an absolute mess and had been abandoned for 20 years Finecraft were able to retain the front facade while constructing a new modern home with what was left of the old bones of the home It turned out beautifully and is true to the architects design It was delivered on time and mostly on budget I would recommend them to any other property owner in similarly situated historicalrenovation jobs
5,As an architect Im naturally very protective of my clients with regard to contractor selection  With Finecraft i know that my clients are in good hands with a professional honest and thorough contractor  Their work speaks for itself in terms of quality craftsmanship and they are a delight to working with  Communication is one of the most important parts of client management and Finecraft clearly excels in this department I would strongly recommend Finecraft to all of my clients no matter what type of project we design
5,"We could not have imagined a better renovation experience Everyone at Finecraft was a pleasure to work with from the owner all the way to the project manager employees and subcontractors All were extremely nice friendly attentive and with tremendous attention to detail You could always contact them with a question and they would get back to you very quickly to explain or help 

They did a great job on the addition of a mudroom expansion and creation of a new open floor plan kitchenfamily room combo moving of a bathroom renovation of two other bathrooms and replacing the entire outside including roof windows siding patio walkway and portico 

They completely transformed our house into a brand new property and we could not thank them enough They were exactly on budget and on time with no delays even though we substantially expanded the scope of the project They were able to change gears smoothly and efficiently as our ideas evolved through the course of the work They worked around our busy lives with 3 small children and were able to create a fully functioning minikitchen to allow us to stay in the house during the work  Highly recommend them for your renovationaddition needs"
5,Finecraft did an extension on my historic house and it really is beautiful George kept me in the loop about how it was all going The team were efficient and respectful of my property and the problemsolving on the best way to get it all done was excellent I would highly recommend this company
5,As both architect and client I was pleased with Finecraft Contractors I found the crews to be hardworking and pleasant With our project George took a hands on approach from beginning to end and collaborated well to help create what we envisioned for our home
4,"Generally quite pleased with our experience with Finecraft  We hired them to complete a three story 900 sq ft addition plus some renovations to the existing space in our NW DC home originally built in 1932  They worked well with our architect and showed consideration and willingness to work with us throughout the process and were responsive to the minor concerns of our neighbors  We were able to stay in our home throughout the project which was completed though punchlist in less than 6 months

In particular we found the quality of their carpentry everything from floors decking exterior closet work trim and paint to be outstanding  We were very impressed and received lots of compliments from friends and family

Two areas Id suggest clients keep in mind first as with almost all contractors their approach to project management isnt to the same standard as with full service designbuild firms  Youll want to be proactive on communication about timelines and confirm everything in writing either emails or text  They are great at honoring commitments but sometimes memories arent perfect and its helpful to have a record

The second area related to above was with the electrical work  We did change things up a bit but even with that I wasnt super happy with the electrician  Some of the work could have been done to a higher quality and we had to tussle a bit him to get what we wanted in a couple of cases the project wasnt done exactly as we wanted  That could have been prevented if we did a better job documenting and holding them to what we discussed

That all said Id definitely recommend them  Friendly and flexible quality workmanship and great price"
5,We hired Finecraft to repair our master bathroom after the discovery of a leak and mold  The Finecraft team was very professional and a pleasure to work with  They listened to our concerns as well as our ideas and came up with recommendations that fit with the design  They have a great network of suppliers and we were able to find great deals on tiles fixtures and granite
5,After a year of discussions with our architect and Finecraft over the renovation of our 1920s colonial we decided to go from a one story addition to a three story addition George patiently addressed numerable questions raised by my detail oriented husband We lived in the house during the eight months of renovation which enabled us to closely examine the outstanding craftsmen at work George regularly came up with creative solutions to maximize the functionality of the space within our budget When my husband and I disagreed about anything we could always rely on Georges professional vision and diplomatic resolution   My serotonin levels would rise each day when I saw George and Vivien arrive in the red pickup they inspire confidenceThe Finecraft team is committed to excellent craftsmanship in a timely manner We enjoyed working with them immensely and would love to do another project with them soon
5,Finecraft Contractors is by far the most professional caring competent company we have used to work on our home They completely restyled our 1940s Cape Cod 1st floor as well as completed other outside improvements with magnificent results From start to finish we always knew what was going on with our project All of the folks on the project were absolutely the best  and they all stayed on the job until it was finished As with older homes there are usually surprises when making changes to the floor plan Our team anticipated those possibilities and problemsolved with us to accommodate our wishes We felt that Finecraft truly cared about us our needs and our home and we could not be more pleased We truly feel part of the Finecraft family
5,Tess Moran and Cabinet Discounters have worked with Finecraft Contractors on many projects  Finecraft can always be counted on for beautiful craftsmanship excellent project management and top notch customer service
5,Fisher Lumber has been working together with Finecraft Contractors for four decades They perform first class detailed workmanship If quality is what you want in your home improvementslook no further
5,I am an architectural designer based in LA and my parents live in Rockville MD  Though they were in need of some basic home maintenance repairs as well as a kitchen renovation they were completely intimidated by the construction process and didnt know where to begin  Finecraft was recommended to me by a reputable architecture firm in Maryland and it was a very smooth process to get everything completed on time and on budget once they were provided with a scope of work and design even from across the country  My parents are now thoroughly enjoying their kitchen makeover and new non leaking windows
5,"We were the architects for a complete 2nd floor remodeling job in Rockville The project included the complete reconfiguration of the master bathroom and bedroom as well as moving the laundry closet into a new laundry room We recommended Finecraft to our clients when they asked us about a trusted contractor Often times it is risky for an architect to recommend a certain contractor but with Finecraft we have no hesitation I know they will be professional honest and if selected do a good job that is in line with the design intent
I highly recommend them for your home remodeling projects"
5,Professional company with a very personal touch  High quality work You truly get what you pay for  I feel confident every time I refer them to friends or clients  They earn  keep the love  trust from their clients because they are passionate about what they do  Cant say enough wonderful things about this company  leadership
5,We hired Finecraft to perform a remodeling of our townhome third floor It was a significant undertaking as every room was impacted by the remodeling which involved the renovation of the master bathroom second bathroom creation of a laundry room expansion of closet space in the 3 bedrooms creation of 2 linen closets and renovation of the half bathroom on the main floor Finecraft was recommended by the architect who designed the plans of the remodeling as he pointed out the quality of the work performed We ended up hiring Finecraft because they were interested by the project and they wanted to work with us In comparison with other general contractors we interviewed their pricing was very competitive Overall the project lasted 2 months Our family of 4 lived in the house while under renovation the workers were very accommodating and respectful of the circumstances and most importantly very clean in consideration of the work performed What we are the most pleased with is the quality of the work and the details in the finishes They fully enable the vision we had for this remodeling Even though we wish that there was more clarity on the agreement better communication with certain change orders and more flexibility with the allowances we are very pleased to have chosen Finecraft The functionality of our new layout and the beautiful bathrooms are now permanent features of our new home working with Finecraft worth every single penny We also referred Finecraft to friends who have subsequently hired them for their project needs
5,"Top notch service

After meeting with over a dozen contractors we found Finecraft to be the perfect fit for our renovation  They performed the work within the timeline specified and ensured we didnt exceed our budget  The crews showed up MonFri at the same time and progress was made each and everyday  Although we the customer made a number of mistakes Finecraft was patient and understanding ensuring we were satisfied every step of the way

Overall we would recommend anyone use Finecraft for their future renovation needs  I never wouldnt of imagined I would ever be so happy with a contractors performance but here I am writing this review  If your a stickler for exceptionally high quality work without having to pay ridiculous prices go with Finecraft it will be worth the wait considering their high demand"
5,"We have been working with Finecraft Contractors for a while now and have had a great experience  we are stone fabricators and they send us their clients to choose their countertops They are professional and helpful to ensure their clients needs are met  whenever we need specific information about about a job they always make sure everything is correct and we are on the same page on every project As a sales representative I know how important it is to communicate with the client  especially if there is a contractor involved 
We definitely recommend  Finecraft for your house renovation and look forward to working with them for future projects"
5,Finecraft is just terrific Their staff is friendly their work is meticulous and the did our project ontime and within budget
5,I have had the pleasure to work with Finecraft on several projects They are a family owned and operated business who takes pride in their work as well as delivering a remarkable experience to their clients
5,Finecraft is an unusual combination of exceptional talent fine craftsmanship delivering more than expected and with personal touches that would make any home remodeling or home construction project a dream for the owner  On time on the ball on target and on top of the project from start to finish  Its been a pleasure to attend the open houses to discover the range of services and beautiful outcomes
5,Mario worked on two separate projects at my home  One was an outdoor window that needed to be rebuilt the other removing an old bar area and replacing it with a closet  Mario was efficient polite fairly priced and provided outstanding workmanship  Im using him again this month for yet another project  I highly recommend him
5,"I am an Interior Designer and I had the pleasure of working with Finecraft Contractors Inc because my client was doing a major renovation and Finecraft was doing the remodel 
My experience in working with them was professional cordial and efficient  It seemed that our mutual goal was to make sure that our client  got what they wanted to their utmost satisfaction
I treat every client like I would want to be treatedand thats what I saw in Finecraft Contractors Inc as well  Keep up the professionalism and quality of your work"
5,I have found Finecraft to be a very professional company who focuses on customer satisfaction and delivering a superb product above all From first contact to finishing the project Finecraft is friendly professional and genuinely cares The project turned out beautiful and better than I expected
5,We hired Finecraft for three projects that included remodeling our kids bathroom from a single user to multi user setup refinishing our basement and creating a builtin bookcasefireplaceTV wall for the master bedroom  All 3 projects turned out great  The team working on the projects where there every day and they staffed resources accordingly  so some days it was 2 guys and other days there was up to 5 guys depending on what needed to be accomplished  All projects where completed within the time estimate and on the agreed upon prices  Their construction staff all wore corporate teeshirts and where professional and careful of cleanliness and the surrounding spaces  While I think it is hard to determine a low cost provider for these types of services value is more important  And Finecraft delivered that as well as adding a designer to take our project visions into reality  We have more work to do and will hire them again
5,We hired Finecraft to renovate our late1890s row house in DC including putting in a new kitchen  We were very pleased with the work done by Finecraft  George and his team were able to create a kitchen that has all of todays modern amenities but still has the charm and finishes consistent with the age of the house  The craftsmanship of the cabinetry and molding is beautiful  They created plaster molding in the kitchen that matches the original molding perfectly  Beyond the kitchen the Finecraft team carefully restored the walls molding and floors back to their original glory and updated our powder room and foyer tile  The work was done timely and within budget  And the Finecraft team was responsive to our questions and requests  We would recommend them without reservation for any type of renovation  from new build to restoring an older home
5,George and his crew are complete professionals with and eye for details The additions to our house by Finecraft are high quality and very well constructed I highly recommend them for any project
5,We were set to hire another contractor when we met George Papaheriklis of Finecraft Contractors Inc Not having any experience remodeling or hiring contractors and after hearing some of our friends experiences we were very weary and nervous about the whole process Georges openness demeanor and patience answering all of our questions and concerns put us at ease in no time Needless to say after just a few minutes we knew we have found our contractor The experience overall was great and the end result fantastic It was not without its ups and downs but during the process George and the Finecarfts crew were very patient diligent and most of all professional They addressed all of our requests and made sure we were completely satisfied with the end work not an easy feat when dealing with a selfprofessed perfectionist An inch to the left or to the right was not an issue they worked very hard to make us happy George was very handson throughout our project and was available anytime there was a question or concern He was very candid and willing to explain things to us both regarding the scope of work and the costs involved especially on those pesky change orders our own requests Because of his background in architecture George offered suggestions and made changes that made things just right going so far as to doing things just because they will look better no change orders We were living in the house while the renovationaddition was going on Finecraft not only provided us with a temporary kitchen complete with a sink and running water while they did the work but they were very accommodating to our needs and timing made sure everything was clean at the end of the day and took every possible precaution to avoid dust and debris coming into our living space Many friends have commented on the craftsmanship and quality of the work Most of all Finecraft stands behind their work they have been prompt and thorough in addressing all those little and no so little things that sometimes pop up on new construction nothing has been too big or too small for them to come and fix In the end what matters most is that George and the Finecrafts crew has our gratitude respect and above all trust
4,We contacted Finecraft for a smaller project in the summer of 2016 based on the Houzz reviews They contacted us back very quickly but because we had a tight deadline Finecraft were not able to do the project themselves but recommended one of their subcontractors called American Trademark AT renovated a small master bath for us on a very short deadline and completed the project in just over 2 weeks The process went smoothly and we got the bathroom we wanted They cleaned up at the end of each day and kept the mess to a minimum The team was professional and met the deadline and stayed within budget After completion we noticed that some paint in the stairway to our second floor had been ripped off probably when they removed the paper that had protected the stairs Not a big job to have fixed but the reason what I did not give the full 5 stars
5,We hired Finecraft Contractors Inc for a third floor addition to our row house in Washington DC  We would highly recommend Finecraft as a contractor  We were very happy with their work  In addition they were responsive answered our questions and concerns promptly and went above and beyond to make sure the project was completed to our satisfaction including the completion a number of added change orders along the way and completing punchlist items
5,We contacted Finecraft because one of my coworkers had used them for 23 projects and recommended their work  Niko and Chris came to the house and looked over the kitchen  They immediately made some useful suggestions about the design for our new kitchen  Niko put us in contact with a first rate designer  We visited Appliance Distributors Unlimited ADU after seeing the listing on the Finecraft website  We worked with the designer and a representative from ADU through several iterations of design cabinet selection and appliance selection until we had a design and set of appliances that we liked and that fit within our budget  The good folks at Finecraft got to work on Tuesday July 5th and finished on Friday July 15th  They had told us it would take about two weeks meaning 10 business days and it took 9   Most of the work on the kitchen was done by one worker Moses and his assistant  The work was extremely well done  Moses is a true craftsman  He is meticulous and he knows what he is doing  There were several points along the way at which we had to make decisions about routing wires the vent for the hood and other things  We were given the opportunity to participate in the decision making where it was appropriate to do so  All in all we are very satisfied with the final product  I would be very happy to have Finecraft do other projects such as our master bathroom especially if Moses or someone else with similar skill is involved
5,After interviewing several other local contractors I hired Finecraft to relocate our master bathroom to the window line to permit natural light in the bathroom  We also created a master dressing room closet  I was so impressed with their work that I expanded on the assignment to include several other projects  I truly enjoyed working with George  He is delightful to work with  George comes up with excellentcreative ideas to solve issues while being sensitive to cost restrictions  George was personally very involved in our project from start to finish and he went over and beyond many times  The construction workers who were in our home were very respectful of our home and cleaned up every day  They were very accommodating and did an excellent job  FineCraft cared very much about our project and ensured that we were satisfied  I am very pleased with the project and FineCraft and highly recommend them
5,We recently completed a magnificent kitchen and renovation project with Finecraft and we could not be happier George and his team brought their fine workmanship and attention to detail that made all the difference in producing a finished product that exceeded our expectations George was very handson throughout our project and made himself available anytime there was a question or concern  Because of his extensive background in architecture George worked well with our architect and other vendors we used to complete our project The entire Finecraft team was extremely professional responsive and truly a pleasure to work with  I would not hesitate to recommend Finecraft to any homeowner interested in doing a renovation or building a brand new home
5,Finecraft did a fantastic job on remodeling my bedroom and bathroom The work crew was tremendous  talented courteous professional on time The design staff was very helpful in helping me with decisions on color selection of materials and decor They were very accommodating and a pleasure to collaborate with
5,We have worked with Finecraft Contractors Inc in several projects now and it we must say their work is 5star In addition to their quality and superb customer service they are a joy to work with Its rare to see first hand a construction company that stands behind their word and delivers with such abundance The Finecraft team truly cares for they clients and goes the extra mile to make sure they are happy and satisfied with the project Looking forward to more projects with them
5,"My wife and I downsized to a condo The location of our new condo  was exactly what we wanted but the interior of the condo was not We decided to gut our 2000 sqft condo and  construct a very  modernly designed one After much searching  we and our designer chose Finecraft as the builders We presented  precise plans which had a number of unusual features  Finecraft did excellent work details of the construction were carefully attended to they arranged for material to be brought from Portugal Japan and elsewhere they were flexible in accommodating some changes we made as the construction went along The configuration of our glasswork was unusual in shape and size but  the work of Finecraft in managing to actually bring the glass into the condo and install it  was truly impressive 

The cost of the project was what we had agreed to The project took a little longer than expected But this was because of the severe limitations our condo association placed on the times when work could be done  and the convoluted  rules and unpredictable inspection scheduling  imposed by the Fairfax County building inspection bureaucracy

Finally  the President of Finecraft George Papaheraklis  kept a keen eye on the projects progress as frequently present  and responded quickly to any questions we had   We highly recommend Finecraft"
5,Finecraft did great work for us and when we had issues arrive they were quick to rectify them We are very appreciative of there attentiveness
5,We recently had two bathrooms updated by Finecraft in our 1930s Glover Park house and could not be happier with the process and results From the beginning Niko and his team excelled at communication  whether it was Niko checking in to make sure the work had begun on time or Chris our project manager letting us know what work would be done We were impressed with how hard their team worked to make sure the project was complete before our planned movein date Every time we went to the house to check on the progress the team was working incredibly hard and were happy to show us what had been completed that day We are already planning to use Finecraft again for future projects
5,"In February 2016 Finecraft renovated our family room  The owner sketched a preliminary drawing based on our desire for light and warmth and provided a ballpark cost estimate  We discussed the options and details and finalized the plan and cost estimate with the caveat that we could be flexible with the artistic plan and the cost if and as needed The big decisions were made prior to beginning the work  We were guided to a door company to select a door and a stone company to pick out surround and hearth stone To make a more expansive family room with plenty of light they knocked down a wall installed a window that matched the other two windows already in the room built bookcases with storage cabinets a window seat with drawers and a closet installed a wood floor and ceiling lights updated the fireplace from a brick to stone façade with an inset for a flat panel television and replaced a sliding glass door with a double French door  The crew arrived on time each day completed the work assignments and cleaned up at days end The crew was friendly professional and not intrusive In fact they were so trustworthy that we provided access to a key for flexibility such that we were not dependent on their work schedule  We were contacted at the end of each day with a summary of what was done what would be done next and what we as the homeowners needed to decide or go pick out in the week ahead eg paint color cabinet door knobs  The crew even moved large furniture in and out of the work space so we did not have to do so Overall our experience with Finecraft was extremely positive The work was done within schedule and budget We have worked with Finecraft on previous renovations large and small and will do so again
The crew at Finecraft are true professionals well trained and skilled such that they act independently and do not require direct supervision"
5,I had the opportunity to work with George and his crew on a number of different home renovations ranging from small remodels to full bottom to top demolition through renovation  In all instances I found the crews to be pleasant and hardworking and fully in alignment with Georges vision for the final product  George takes a very hands on approach to all his projects from the beginning to the end and works very well with his clients to create exactly what they envision for their new home
5,I have worked with Finecraft in three different projects and I find them very professional and detail oriented I am a designer with many years of experience and worked with a lot of different contractors Gisela Interiors
5,I contacted Finecraft from California after seeing a picture of a bathroom that I loved on Houzz they answered the phone when I called and emailed me all the information I needed within 24 hours  They really were wonderful  Much appreciated for helping out  5 Stars for awesome customer service
5,After interviewing and getting bids and references from 10 different recommended contractors we hired Finecraft Contractors to excavate and gut renovate our basement and they did an exceptional job  They worked with us to make my vision come alive and their attention to detail and workmanship exceeded my very high expectations  The Finecraft team was reliable respectful and responsive and they finished ahead of schedule and on budget  I would 100 recommend them
5,We had Finecraft remodel our kitchen and family room from July 13  October 13 2015 Every aspect of the renovation was a positive experience They said it would take three months and they were done basically three months to the date they started The quality of work was superb and it was easy to get in touch with either the owner or foreman throughout the entire project We will definitely use Finecraft again
5,Finecraft Contractors are the best  Their workmanship is topnotch and their workers are all experts in the respective fields  They are a fantastic crew  We are pleased with our additions and changes which will enable us to stay in our house as we become less mobile We now have a beautiful custommade rollin shower and other bathroom changes that enable a person in a wheelchair to use the bathroom This was a tricky undertaking because of the configuration we wanted Most importantly the owner George Papaheriklis listened to us and made sure that the construction was perfect  He consulted with us all during the construction
5,"Fine craft Contractors lives up to their name Fine Craft   Their leadership and crew were 100 and superseded all expectations   I highly recommend hiring Fine Craft if you want true quality work professionals who are passionate honest and efficient  A true headache free experience   

Thank you Fine Craft for everything you have done for me and my family

5,I hired Finecraft to build out a previously unfinished basement reconstruct a front porch and a side porch and replace all of the shutters on our houses façade  Finecraft did a tremendous job  The workers were professional worked quickly but with high quality and there was always great communication so I knew what activities were going to occur and when  We actually had an unforeseen waterproofing issue with our foundation which Finecraft addressed quickly provided an effective solution and executed the fix at a very reasonable cost  It was a pleasure to work with Finecraft and I cannot recommend them more highly
5,"Finecraft Contractors Inc

We completed a kitchenfamily room renovation for our 40 year old home  We met with  three contractors and received three quotes  From design support to workmanship and quality we were pleased with every aspect of our experience with Finecraft   After  seeing a Finecraft renovation in the neighborhood we were sold  

The entire team was professional clean and respectful of our home  It is never easy to live through a kitchen renovation but George and Niko went out of their way to make the process easy for our family  Without question we would recommend FineCraft to friends and family"
5,"Finecraft was recommended by our architect for a major renovation to our house expanded and remodeled kitchen family room and master bedroom ans master bathroom as well as some other updates

The workmanship and attention to detail was outstanding  Finecraft was very responsive throughout the project they provided good ideas and suggestions they cleaned up very thoroughly throughout theproject  The project manager was excellent and they clearly take great pride in their work

We had done another major renovation several years earlier in a former house and we wish that Finecraft had done that one as well because there was no comparison in the quality and management of our earlier project with the one that Finecraft managed

I highly recommend Finecraft for any home renovation or construction project"
5,We are first time home buyers and have never dealt with home renovations Our house was in decent condition at purchase but needed a serious facelift throughout  we hired Finecraft to renovate the majority of the house which meant new bathrooms kitchen new drywall pretty much everywhere electrical etc etc They did an excellent job guiding us through the process their site manager was particularly good always calm easy to talk to They handled hiccups in the schedule and work plan very well and had really good suggestions for improvements throughout the house removing parts of walls design ideas for custom cabinetry Overall excellent experience and we are thrilled with the results Highly recommend
5,"Late 2014 through spring 2015 FineCraft undertook a major reconstruction of our backyard terrace plus improvements to the inside of our house  Outside work included new retaining walls with extensive foundation improvements extensive drainage improvements blue stone paving tree pits trellis and wood slat fencing new lighting redirected and reinforced stairways and removal of sunroom parapets  Inside work included two skylights two new windows that required breaking through the existing structures installing lighting fixtures and ceiling fan and completion of requested small tasks
 
Being a project limited to a small area detail design and execution were critical  We employed The Kurylas Studio as project architects  Kurylas Studios recommended FineCraft as one of several contractors  FineCrafts expertise with architecture and attention to detail proved critical to the project success  As a real team effort FineCraft working with the architect and us made several valuable design alterations   They rebuilt one retaining wall rather than repair it and for a second retaining wall they used traditional brick facing rather than ¼ inch brick facing  Both company owners and the project foreman were professional respectful knowledgeable and easy to work with  When we disagreed their professionalism always led to quick resolutions which all parties felt good about  Impressive to us was how fair FineCraft priced change orders  Not only are we satisfied the whole team is proud how the project turned out"
5,We hired Finecraft a few years back when we were planning a major renovation to our home We had completed a similar renovation in the past on a previous home and the difference between our first experience and this one was like night and day From the very beginning George his foreman and the crew were professional responsive worked quickly and efficiently and got the project done in the time estimated We lived in our home during the renovation and the Finecraft crew showed up on time EVERY time did the work each day and cleaned up after each days work We had the same foreman for the complete project and he reflected Georges and Finecrafts values of professionalism attention to detail and pride in craftsmanship During the process George would review the upcoming work and make sure that all the details were taken care of Their workmanship was superb the fine details that speak to master carpentry and pride in workmanship are evident throughout the project We have lived in our home for 10 years since that work was done and it still looks as good today as it did when it was newly finished We recently needed some repair and remodeling done to another part of our home and we didnt even need to go out to bid  we just hired Finecraft again You will not be sorry you chose them
5,Finecraft Contractors Inc is an excellent company The staff are very professional and efficient I was so impressed by their work The quality and design of their projects are some of the best Ive seen in this industry I would gladly work with them again
5,This was my first experience working with George of Finecraft He is a professional who listens asks intelligent questions and proposes great solutions based on his years of experience in the industry The quality of Finecrafts work is high and the staff is friendly and responsive I strongly recommend George and the Finecraft team
5,Finecraft built an addition and new outbuilding designed by my firm for one of the more finelydetailed late19th century homes in the town of Kensingtons historic district The owners chose Finecraft because they wanted to match the quality of detail and workmanship that had sold them on the house in the first place The end result did not disappoint Finecraft performed at a high level of professionalism and the quality of their workmanship was superb
5,"Finecraft has been in the area for 30 years now and has demonstrated time and time again that their company stands for quality I can say this because Ive seen their work firsthand and Ive followed them for many years now I simply love their work and their quality They stand by what they build no matter what It goes without saying they really care for the houses they build and for the homeowners they collaborate with 

As a homeowner its important for me to know that I can rely on the contractor I hire I can say without a doubt that I can rely on Finecraft to follow through and produce a quality product without concern or hassle Once you find this type of relationship you never want to let it go 

Having a good contractor is one thing Having a great contractor that you can work well with that has good communication skills coordinates well and who you can build a fine working relationship with is quite another experience 

It goes without saying Id recommend them without a doubt

5,As a 25 year old Company a window supplier such as ourselves have worked with thousands of remodelors locally Finecraft Contractors have stood the test of time having more than a 20 year relationship with our company This clearly speaks to the way they handle themselves professionally  work closely with their clients The level of quality that they deliver every time ensures their future Great companies such as this stay strong and busy making their Clients dreams become reality We look forward for another 20 years  more
5,The details and craftsmanship in the work by Finecraft Contractors is exquisite Being an Architectural Photographer I see a lot of houses on a daily basis Im very impressed with the close attention to detail and the quality of the work that Finecraft has put into this beautiful house Its truly a work of art and Im excited to photograph more of their work
5,"This project involved the complete renovation of the second and third attic floors of the back wing of our historic home to create a master bedroom suite with full bath and 2 walkin closets laundry area and linen closet on the second floor and two bedrooms and a full bath on the attic floor  It involved creating 2 new dormers and a new gable on the attic floor and installation of new windows  Considerable upgrading of joists and rafters to meet modern codes was required in this historic home  Great care was taken to ensure that all changes were consistent with the historic nature of this home including custommilled moldings and use of antique recovered heart pine flooring among others
Finecraft did an outstanding job on this project as they have in previous experience with them on other projects on this property  They took exceptional care to get the details of the finishing right  The same experienced workers were present for the entire project  They listened careful to any questions or concerns we had and consulted frequently with us as the job progressed  They were highly professional at all times and it was a pleasure to have them in our house we remained resident in the rest of the house throughout the renovation  Their proposed cost for the project was reasonable and the job came in at the agreed price and we agreed to some minor change orders as the work progressed  The project took about 6 months for completion which was somewhat longer than anticipated but not unreasonable given the structural work involved
Overall I have the highest recommendation for Finecraft for their professionalism and the quality of their work from their initial comments on the design and detailing through demolition construction and finishing to the final cleanup  It was a pleasure to work with them and I recommend them unconditionally"
5,They are my favorite They always seem to make things right Even when things are tough they work through them and the outcome is always amazing They have worked on several projects in my house and all of which are excellent products which reflect the level of detailed work that epitomizes Finecraft From smaller projects to larger ones from my experience I can guarantee theyll leave you satisfied with the job you contract them for hands down
5,"Finecraft says it all What an amazing company Their detail to workmanship customer service and setting the standards for quality standards all across the board is what they are all about George the owner of the company sets the standards for perfection in all the building and project management and Niko sets the standards for customer service and high end marketing using the latest technical tools to stay up with the newest building trends Their team members hold to all these standards which make it one of the best remodeling companies in the area I would highly recommend Finecraft to anyone looking for a company to take care of all their building needs and to any architect or design firm that would like to collaborate with their services You cant go wrong in working with this company

5,"Finecraft provided on site inspection of 11 wooden window frames including a bay window in the front and on the side of our townhouse  They identified the areas with water damage developed a scope of work and provided an estimate for replacing the damaged wood with a PVC product  Their estimate was far and away better than those provided by the other two contractors  They then proceeded to compete the scope of work over a fourday period

We were impressed from the beginning with the professionlism customer relations and communication with Finecraft   Niko their office managersupervisor was very communicative as was Mario the primary carpenterrepairman  Mario and his coworker Henry did a great job on all of the windows some of which required a complex scaffold setup  The results were excellent  We can now be assured of the integrity of those 11 window frames

I will use Fincraft again and recommend them to others  They did excellent work for us"
5,"Finecraft has done numerous projects in my house including the installation of hardwood floors staircases bathroom renovations and the installation of French doors Their work was impeccable their estimates to the point and their timing on target One of the few companies that both the owners and the workers have integrity on their business transactions put the customer above everything else and perform the work seamlessly even when there are problems
They recently completed a deck Gazebo that the the jewel of my deck and house As in the other projects their work was impeccable on time and professional"
5,Finecraft recently renovated our basement family room bathroom and bedroom  They transformed a boring dark subterranean basement into a beautiful lightfilled walkout family room  In addition to renovating the bathroom and upgrading the bedroom they also created a project room  The results are stunning  Their organization and attention to detail resulted in a large scale project that moved smoothly despite involving the skill of several tradesmen all of whom are on staff with Finecraft no subcontracting challenges  We could not be happier with the results
5,I have had the pleasure of working with the professionals of Finecraft Contractors Inc for several years now I have seen many of their stellar products in working with them I believe the staff of Finecraft work very hard to ensure that the high quality of service they deliver is really conveyed by their marketing so that their prospective client knows what they have to offer It is the quality in their service and in their projects which is stressed from the project manager to their marketing director and it shows
4,They are very good with their job but expensive They have great staff too Be sure to specify anything you want for them if not you wont get it eg if you want a bathroom be specific with every single detail you want in the bathroom down to the smallest detail like soap holder if not you wont get it If you have the money and you desire a good job done call Finecraft

Company is only as good as the people who 
work for them  I highly recommend Finecraft Contractors"
5,"My first experience with Finecraft Contractors was when my clients selected George Papaheraklis and his team to complete the construction of a large renovation we designed in Chevy Chase  From the meetings prior to the start of construction it was evident that George and his team have a high attention to detail   

Having Finecrafts experience to work through changes and modifications in the field made the process a lot easier for the client and myself  I was continuously amazed with the depth of skills within Finecraft and their ability to selfperform a lot of the work in this whole house transformation  I look forward to working with them on future projects"
5,Finecraft built an addition on our home in 2006 and we asked them to renovate our kitchen which was just completed and is beautiful  They are exceptionally focused on detail  we had a need to adjust the design of the project midstream and they undertook the change without   complaint and at no extra charge  They are easy to work with reliable and courteous  You just have to get used to the hammers going at 730am because they work a long hard day
5,House build in early 1970s Contempoary design We acquired in 1977 Project was from 52011 to 112011 We had some specific ideas at outset like remodel kitchen and baths but more general undeveloped ideas for other improvements like consolidating a small unused balcony room into a walkin closet and enlarged bathroom We moved out for 3 months We never had any issues with Finecraft Contractors in clarity of work the  timeliness of completing projects  or billings We did not use an architect or interior designer Instead we relied upon Finecraft to recommend enhancements we did not see or think about which was a brilliant decision on our part Finecraft George in particular had the ability to visualize a change which could be made to enhance a rooms appearance and in many instances with little added costs For example outside windows for an expanded master bathroom or remaking a large outdated family room with a cathedral ceilng into a  dazzling room We would recommend them without exception and use them again It was indeed a pleasant experience We continue to enjoy to this day their work
5,As a kitchen and Bath designer with 25 years of experience I have worked with many different contractors  Finecraft is one of the best that I have ever worked with  They are true professionals and make all of my designs come to life for our clients  I have hired them to do work on my own home and would not hesitate to recommend them for any project large or small
5,As an Architect Ive had the pleasure of working with Finecraft Contractors and been able to count on George Papaheraklis experience and knowledge on a couple of occasions  Finecraft Contractors work embodies the companys name in as much as the end result of their labors can truly be qualified as fine craft Georges and his crews professionalism is apparent from the planning stages to the execution of the final punch list I look forward to collaborating in the future with George and his firm and would recommend his services to our future clients at  plan Z  a r c h i t e c t s
5,"Finecraft is an excellent home builder and home remodeling general contractor in the Washington DC region I have worked them them on at least 10 significant projects over as many years What sets them apart are 4 strengths
1 Their commitment to be faithful to the design created on paper and   not deviate from it without sufficient cause
2 Their commitment to maintain a customers trust and confidence with them during the course of the work
3 Their technical expertise makes for an enjoyable building process
4 Above all else their ability to finish a project strongly and completely Customers naturally expect this but it is not all that common in the remodeling industry It takes a highly committed professional general contractor that is adequately compensated to achieve this"
5,"Owner George Papaheraklis is close to finishing our second project  One was demolishing a kitchen and family room and making a single space with a bump out for a breakfast area  Neighbors who know our community are amazed when they see it  We have now gutted an oldstyle bathroom vanity area and modest walkin closet and are making a larger integrated bathroom with a bigger walk in closet

What distinguishes George is that he is an artist with a keen eye  Not only will he tweak an architects plans for aesthetic and functional reasons but even as the project is in midstream he is consstantly thinking perhaps we should do it this way a frame around tiling or switch a regular door to a pocket door or change the orientation of the stall shower glass door He obsesses about little details and in the long run that makes a big difference

I found out about Finecraft in the house of a friend where George had gutted the back of the house and added on to it  I had no doubt about the big picture and the attention to detail  If any reader could see a typical Finecraft project up close he would not have to rely on ramblings like thishe would see the work and know all he needs to know to hire the company"
5,Finecraft Contractors completely revamped our family room  Tore out old dated paneling and popcorn ceiling  Now it is not all chopped up looking and it is calming to look into it  Also they made custom bookcases on the sides of the fireplace that have ample storage below and great display space above  Im very pleased with the results and the respectful people who came into our home to do this work
5,Finecraft is an excellent construction company and a pleasure to work with  George Papaherkalis has an excellent sense of design and constructions his crews are skilled and the final product is enjoyable space to live in  I have hired them five times over 25 years and would use them again
5,"Finecraft is an excellent company to work with  Honest reliable creative dependable and of course the attention to all the details are second to none The crew are hard working and respectful George is an inspiration and works so hard to come up with the best possible solutions for his clients  The team thinks creatively and out of the box which is so unusual  This is especially important in an historic renovation where sensitivity to the integrity of the house is key to bringing it back to life
I would highly recommend 
George and his team"
5,Finecraft built us a brand new home from scratch and I could not have been happier with the work  The attention to detail was outstanding and they were so nice and communicated so well with us throughout the process  I would highly recommend them to anybody
4,"When I work with George and his team of builders I know that the final product is going to be beautiful  He gets the details right he understands our design goals and he puts his heart and soul into the work

5,"We had Barron do a complicated addition and remodel that added a bathroom and expanded the footprint of the house No they definitely were not the least expensive bid we got on the project But they did really nice work mostly on time and within budget we expanded the scope of the project midway through which added to the final cost and completion date We were nervous going in because friends of ours with similar or even smaller projects would complain about things taking much longer than promised and being ghosted for days by their project managers

Fortunately that wasnt the case with Barron Leeran the project manager was very communicative and flexible responding quickly to questions and issues while helping us stay within budget and make the most of what we could spend Thanks to the companys willingness to work with us we were able to stay in the house during the majority of the project  it wasnt easy for the construction crew to work around us and our furniture but it saved us a lot of money and allowed us to splurge in areas that were important to us

We did run into a few problems along the way but Leeran was very responsive and got things fixed or redone quickly As worried as we were about ballooning costs unpleasant surprises and the project dragging on and on I cant say enough how pleasantly surprised we were

The addition is beautiful and the house is much more functional and enjoyable And our teenage daughter is thrilled to have her own bathroom"
1,Im very unhappy with my experience with Baron We worked on a 1000 sq ft remodel that took over a year when it was originally quoted for 36 months Months after Im still trying to clean up the mess they left me with and the damages they made to my house It was a headache and complete stress working with them They are the nightmare remodel that I hear others talk about Our project managers did not remembered anything that was discussed and there was little to no follow through They would say they were going to do something or that this is how it would look but then when its done its completely different and not what was discussed Every meeting with the project managers ended up being pointless I had to escalate many issues to the main office and the owner Mike in order to get some type of acknowledgement explanation or answer HVAC was installed incorrectly exterior hole in the wall was not repaired correctly crew did not know how to install our cabinets incorrect measurements which affected cabinet order and window order which was not returnable patio furniture used as work benches patio and yard used as a dumping ground etc We were the points that had to point out the issues and then argue with them to get it resolved when these are very simple things that should just be done correctly in the first place Follow the manual follow what city inspector expects etc I cant imagine the customers who dont know any better and assume things are okay when there could be bigger issues caused to their house in the long run
5,"Finding a contractor that does quality work and is reliable is rare My husband and I decided to remodel  90 of my childhood home and after meeting with six contractors it was clear from the beginning that we wanted to work with Leeran He was always prompt to our meetingscalls explained things in an easily digestible manner and was honest 

This project was insanely important to my family as we had a lot of memories in the old home and the Baron crew created a new modern home for us to make new memories in with our toddler Leeran was one of the big reasons why our project got done on time especially impressive during COVID as he was extremely responsive Anytime we had a question or needed his advice during the project he was there to help answer questions explain the timeline help facilitate and project manage timelines with the crewvendors etc 

We also worked with Noya one of their interior designers and she was so sweet and helpful in designing our home She attended multiple meetings with us to understand our design aesthetic shop with us for finishes kitchen tile countertop etc 

I have been recommending Baron the entire time weve been working with them Their work is top notch and having a PM dedicated to your project is a game changer My husband and I are working parents with a toddler so it was less stressful and not as overwhelming having Leeran help steer the project for us"
5,"I had a great experience working with Leeran and the Baron constructions Our project was based in Sunnyvale while we were living in San Francisco with a less than two year old toddler in the middle of the pandemic We were redoing 23rd of our home which entailed large structural changes We knew this wasnt going to be easy and we wanted to go with the best in the area 

For day 1 Leeran and the firm were punctual outright honest and very collaborative making them one of the most dependable contractors Ive ever worked with In the early days I remember brainstorming layouts with Leeran late into the night over zoom He was always very accommodating open to creative ideas and sharing this experience to keep the project feasible When it came to quotes while Baron was a bit on the higher side I knew I was going to get what Im paying for So we decided to go with them 

The project had a very tight deadline as our lease in SF was ending in March and we were starting this project in early October Leeran stayed on top of it throughout Even when there were hiccups like when we found out our ducts needed to be replaced and one of our structural beam was infected with termites Leeran added more workforce instead of pushing out the finish date Leeran has a fabulous team of people he works with From the architect to the designer everyone was such a pleasure to work with From finalizing permits to ordering finished materials everything was so systematic and well planned that Im afraid Im spoiled for life 

The final product of their work was above and beyond my expectations When I shared the photos with my friends and family I had to convince them that they are not photoshopped Checkout out the Kitchen  Bathrooms Design  Remodel project from Sunnyvale

I highly recommend Leeran and Baron Constructions If I had to do it all over again Id go with Barons again"
5,"We started working with Baron Construction this year on a multistage project and we are about to complete Phase I of it  a full KitchenLiving room remodel to a modern farmhouse Leeran is our Project Manager throughout the project  Overall I am very happy with the work so far and how the new Kitchen  Living room area is shaping up

Like any renovation project there are surprises and complexities you encounter along the way  and while not everything always goes according to original plan I truly appreciate working on this with Leeran  we are able to work through it together evaluate different ideas an options and were able come up with reasonable solutions to all problems along the way I also appreciate the completeness of the work and ensuring we get a higher quality finished product which meets code  Leeran ensures the work is done right above everything else

I look forward to continuing our work together in Phase II of the project"
5,They rebuilt our shower to exacting specifications We are in love with the resulting artwork which is sturdy and beautiful I highly recommend the services
5,There is a lot of unethical behavior on the part of the staff They do not respond to calls and dont care about the customers I had a very bad experience
5,This companys service is overpriced and their staff is unprofessional It is a shady business and I regret choosing them They have been refusing to give me a refund for two weeks The service has been inconvenient for me
1,"BUYER BEWARE  If you are thinking of hiring Baron Construction Or David to do any major work  think twice The company is a complete disaster and incompetence They dont understand architectural or structural plans or even care about doing so 
On their website Baron Construction claim that We are LAs premier DesignBuild Contractor with over 55 years of combined experience but their presence in the SF Bay Area is a mess
Their approach is to sign you up for a highpremium contact and then hire halfcost subcontractors and provide zero supervision to any work Subcontractors do whatever they think sometimes not even up to Code with zero guidance or supervision from GC Subcontractors make costly mistakes for which Baron Construction will charge you Subcontractors damage expensive finishing materials and nobody at Baron Construction takes responsibility Dont bother Take your money somewhere else where you will get quality communication and responsibility We hired Baron Construction to build our dream home and with the project still unfinished it turned to be a nightmare all way along Baron Construction had promised us completion in 9 months but turned it into over 25 years project We had no choice but to fire Baron Construction and it took other General Contractor a long time to correct all mistakes Baron Construction and its subcontractors had made"
5,Have you ever envisioned and dreamed of improving your home We have for a very long time And with the help of a talented Baron team and great delegation by Sean the project manager were now living in our dream home Despite many setbacks this year due to pandemic Baron team made our vision a reality
5,We hired the Baron team to turn our historic San Jose craftsman house into our dream home and could not be happier  It was a major project including converting an unfinished lowceiling basement into permitted living space an addition to the main floor and rebuilding most of the structure while keeping some of the original redwood bones and craftsman charm that other builders didnt want to touch  Ron and Eli have been with us every step of the way from architectural drawings and shepherding plans through the city to major excavation and framing now to the last finishing touches  Whether Baron employees or hired subcontractors everyone on the job has done top notch work and displayed pride in their craft  Big shout outs to Salvador the framer for stopping at nothing short of perfection and to Courtney the interior designer for helping turn our ideas into a reality beyond our dreams  We will be raising our family in a beautiful home and creating many memories for years to come  Thank you Baron
5,"Our home was built in the 1950s and needed some major work  What started as the wish to add central heat turned into a entire home remodel with the help of Baron  We bid out several companies for plans and Ron was personable kind  asked great leading questions  He returned with three options Good  Better  Best and provided the reasoning behind them all  He was knowledgeable of the requirements of our city plus had great suggestions on how to better our ideas  

In the end we ended up adding 400 square feet plus brought the entire home down to the studs  We updated everything  from the roof to plumbing to electrical to the stucco around the house  The end product is absolutely gorgeous and we are thrilled with the work that was done  

The project completed on time  and although over budget it was due to unforeseen circumstances lead  asbestos and beautiful add ons like our newly vaulted great room ceiling and front of the house upgrade  The on time portion was essential though  as with SIP starting due to COVID19 we were able to return to our home from the small apartment we were staying in  Ron kept the team on schedule and pushed hard to ensure we could come back ASAP  

I highly recommend Baron  especially Ron as the PM on the job  Between his ability to keep the project on schedule and Courtneys amazing eye for interior design  we are proud to have our kitchen  master bath featured on Barons website Home Expansion  Renovation"
5,Very professional prompt and they do great work Highly recommended Obi was always reachable by phone and responded promptly to all queries Extremely pleased
5,We remodeled our 30year old kitchen and appreciate the job that Baron did  We especially appreciate the work of Obi the Project Manager who kept track of the various subcontractors and their schedules  As with any remodeling project there were hiccups along the way and his sense of humor and commitment to quality helped us a lot  We love the finished product
5,I used Baron for design  build for a master suite bedroom  bath addition on my house    They did a great job  The quality of work was high and they worked through a number of unexpected challenges that popped up along the way  The project took a bit longer than originally expected but very happy with the final results
5,Baron is great to work with They are respectful and responsive and their work turned out great They have experts in lighting plumbing etc
5,We worked with Baron Construction and specifically project manager Ron Hogen to remodel our 120 year old Victorian home It was a long and complicated project that was basically a gut job for a significant portion of the house  involved a completely new kitchen great room relocated the kitchen to a new part of the house laundry room bedroom 3 bathrooms butler pantry finished basement and more Now as I sit in my beautiful new and sparkling kitchen great room I can wholeheartedly recommend Ron and Baron Construction for your project Looking back on our project  yes there were ups and downs and some challenges as you would expect with the extent of our project especially given we lived in the house through most of it However Ron maintained open communication and transparency throughout He was dedicated responsive and accommodating Their price was extremely competitive and in the end they finished very close to the original bid most of the change orders were initiated by us We are happy with the quality of their work and they didnt close the project until all the final minor adjustments were perfect We will be calling them for any future projects
5,I was very pleased with baron construction especially Etels project management She was very professional and accommodated our quick turn with this remodel She was attentive with my concerns and responded quickly with questions If something didnt work Etel went beyond to do the research to figure out a solution I would recommend Etel to anyone
5,My wife and I needed one of our bedrooms completely rebuilt flooring ceiling walls insulation painting AND we wanted to completely renovate the attached bathroom For starters I will admit I am extremely particular I scheduled consultation appointments with 5 contractors all of which had great reviews on Yelp and other sites From prior personal experience and friends experiences with contractors their reputation on the street is not that great poor communication lack of timeliness etc After all the consultations I decided to go with Baron Construction For the record they were not the cheapest but their offer was fair and I felt good about our project manager Leeran Shlomo Our project is now complete and I have to say I feel very good about selecting Baron Construction and Leeran Shlomo Leeran proved to be anything other than the contractor stereotypes I mentioned above He was personable friendly a GREAT communicator and he made himself available almost anytime even before 8 am and up until 10 pm at night sometimes His customer service was superb I would highly recommend Baron Construction and this is almost directly attributable to our experience with Leeran Shlomo The project manager can make your life really smooth or miserable Leeran managed our project extremely well and kept us updated almost daily If you can select Leeran I would highly highly recommend him Hes awesome
2,"Never gave them the contract Just too expensive Got 3 more quotes from licensed and bonded contractors and trust me they were 8 times more expensive 
Maybe they are good at doing fabulous job but Ill settle at 95 great job at 18th the price 
2 stars for the project manager who was patient spent time to understand needs"
5,"My husband and I decided to renovate our kitchen After getting some estimates we decided to choose Baron construction This job included removing a wall two fireplaces all cabinets countertops and appliances and then installing new fireplace cabinets quartz waterfall island quartz countertops and backsplash 

Every construction project has some hiccups here and there ultimately its the end products that count We are very pleased with our new kitchen and fireplace The quartz for the island was cut and installed wonderfully Wow factors are definitely there

An incremental payment schedule was provided All changes during the project were itemized and approved by us prior to work We paid as various stages of the work were completed

Overall We are happy with the way our kitchen turned out and we could not be more pleased with Baron Construction and all the products of their teams work"
5,My project manager Lital was beyond fabulous  She was both professional and personal  Professional in every aspect from start to finish and yet personal in the way she listened to me and put my wants and needs at the forefront  I would absolutely call her again if the need would ever arise  Cant say enough good things about her and how she handled my project
5,"We just completed a complicated kitchen remodel and full bath remodel with Baron Construction  The project was completed on time actually early and for the most part within budget  There are always a few surprises with a project dealing with an 80 year old house and constraints imposed by our first major remodel a number of years ago not to mention current building codes  Our project manager Eli and his assistant Obi where wonderful to work with and the Barons management model is unique and ensures positive communication and rapid problem solving throughout the project process  Further the actual work did not start until all critical decisions were made and key materials in place or their delivery date assured eg new kitchen cabinets  This was essential to project timing and minimizing our disruption 

In addition the on site construction crew was amazing  They were there every day as promised and a pleasure to have in our house  Fernando is a master craftsman and even the Palo Alto building inspector told us in front of Fernando that he was an amazing builder who did everything according to best practices and worked to perfection He solves problems and is so conscientious What a prize Baron has in Fernandoand those who work with him as well 

Our new kitchen cabinets had to to fit exact specifications for a variety of reasons and this was very important to us  Eli and Obi did meticulous measurements and the cabinet makers did an excellent job as did the installers Marco and Carlos  They worked hard to have the cabinets just perfectly placed They were true perfectionists 

Eli and Obi were more than fair in listening to our requests and satisfying our needs  They worked around our schedule to insure work timing was handled correctly  And when the few problems did occur the Barons team was on top of them and they were resolved to keep the project on track and meet our specific needs 

The contract for the work was fair  The only real issue for us was that the allowances were somewhat low  We went over because we selected more expensive products We would encourage more generous allowances with the contract budget adjusted accordingly 

Overall we could not be more pleased with Baron Construction their management team and all the products of their full teams work  We are thrilled with our finished product and would certainly use Baron again A big Thank You"
5,"Baron rebuilt our shower to exacting specifications after a previous tile replacement done with another contractor failed just like the original tile  The resulting work is sturdy and beautiful and we couldnt be happier with the results

We had the pleasure of working with Eddie on project management and Lucas as our foreman  Both Eddie and Lucas were very prompt professional and knowledgeable  Any time we had a question they were available to answer  Although it didnt have any material effect on the job we also really enjoyed just chatting with Eddie and Lucas when they were around  Everyone we dealt with felt warm and genuine and it made the whole process a lot more pleasant

Now the work wasnt cheap and we did have some overruns on time estimates but nothing outrageous  When something would go longer than expected Eddie always kept us in the loop as to why

All things considered we would absolutely use Baron again and would recommend them to anyone whos willing to pay for great craftsmanship"
5,"Craftsmanship at Baron Construction is world class  We had the pleasure of working with project manager Ron who worked with us from project definition all the way till the everything was fully completed including the professional power wash to remove any type of debris on the drive way  Ron was with us every step of the way throughout the project and was always super responsive via phoneemailtxt   In addition Ron always came over to checkin with us to ensure were happy with the progress and accommodated to our busy schedule by coming in later in the evenings after were done with the kids dinner

We contacted Baron in Dec 2017 when we purchased our home and wanted them to update 3 of the bathrooms  After a walk through of the existing bathrooms measurements were taken and we received a formal detailed quote  The 2nd best aspect the best being their quality of work of working with Baron is how they never nickle and dimed us  what we paid for the project was exactly what they quoted at the start  fair adjustments due to us adding wetwalls in 2 of the bathrooms which we didnt want initially when we started the project

The only criticism we had with Baron is the length of time it took the finish the bathrooms We were originally told itd take 34 months and it ended up taking 6 months  Part of that is our fault because we had guests over and had to stop construction for a couple of weeks which caused downstream delays The wait was well worth it because the masterful work of Sergio who does tiles was simply amazing  Overall we were extremely happy with the way the bathrooms turned out so we just wanted to take a few mins to acknowledge their amazing work here on Houzz"
4,We recently had our bathroom remodeled and hired baron construction Everyone was professional and courteous We were very happy with the results and would recommend to others
5,As a Realtor my responsibility is to my clients When my sellers wanted to do improvements to their investment property in preparation for Sale we chose Barron Construction for the job they were AMAZING they took all the headache out of the renovation they acquired the permitsoffered insight to the design and materials and even when we hit budget snag they were able to accommodate Eli and his team were super professional and skilled The property sold before ever hitting the market while under construction and was over our target price all cash 7 day close Everybody was happy Will definitely call on them when I have another project And so should you
5,"I interviewed Mike Baron owner of Baron Construction  Remodeling Co to remodel my ranch style home to an up to date open concept look I knew within 10 minutes that this was going to be a good working relationship and I was going to hire his company for this project The first thing that impressed me was I had a long list of things I wanted done and he glanced at it put it aside and just listened to my ideas We did a walk through the house and the first thing he noticed was the foundation in the TV room was sloping and needed to be replaced This was not on my list but he recommended this be my first priority and Im glad I agreed The moldy musty smell that was plaguing me disappeared and the floor is now even 

I was fortunate to have Mike work with me on the whole project As a client I appreciated the consistency and confidence working with one person and helping with the design and selection of materials This was very important to me and high on my list I also appreciated working with the same onsite people when possible

The scope of the project entailed new wood floors crown molding and baseboards throughout the house A beautiful custom fitted cabinet under a wall mounted TV with matching floating shelves in the front room 

The entryway into the kitchen was enlarged to give it the open concept look I wanted The kitchen was enhanced with a quartz countertop sink beautiful backsplash shaker cabinetsdrawers and hardware

Replacing the old brick with natural stone and a streamline mantle changed the existing fireplace

The master shower was gutted and replaced with a decorative mosaic tile strip large complimentary tiles for the shower walls and bathroom floor frameless glass shower doors and an infinity drain The mosaic tile was also used as the backsplash behind the bathroom sinks and an area behind the toilet 

The interior walls were freshly painted with an accent wall in the living room and TV room The exterior of the house took on a whole new look with a change of color 

I do want to qualify that it appears that the project took a long time but this was my decision not the contractor We have two additional projects that will be completed this year and I will be finished with my long dream list

So the questions are Would I hire Baron Construction  Remodeling Co again would I recommend this company to others Am I happy with the results Answer Absolutely"
2,"I wish I could give only 1 star the 2nd star is for what they have done right I read through all the spectacular reviews below so I chose them but ended up really painful experience which will be unforgettable once in my life time This is a really long story I have with them 

Mike appears to be a nice guy and promise whatever you ask claim they could deliver your dream project But when coming down to daytoday project execution it will be your big nightmare and you are doomed if you go with them

I just finished a very large addition project with them and the following are the pitfalls
1 the contract only lists the major items but not down to all the details In the beginning they alluded that they always write contract this way and not worry about the details but later on when specific details were requested they argued that those were not included in the contract and would be considered as change order items for extra cost
2 no interior designer provided in the contract they promised to offer an interior designer to complete my ideas and discuss all the details to select proper fixtures for my huge addition project However the first 2 designers quit after first contact the 3rd one agreed to take this job but couldnt receive my ideas accurately nor complete the design in the booked time frame I ended up doing the rough design on my own with limited knowledge without any professional assistance Had to decide and made all the purchases myself This is in disagreement to the contract
3 upon signing the contract they claimed they would have 46 people on the job site everyday but that only happened in the first 2 weeks After 23 months they began to not have full crew working full time on your project On some days even no one showed up due to various excuses Then the GC began to take vacations or go out of town for personal issues
4 They claim to progress very fast so they want you to have all the fixtures ready or some jobs would be delayed in order to wait for the parts So I had to get almost all parts early on in a short time but then realized theyd reach that task much later
5 Very poor in communication They send multiple people to interface with you and they are sometime inconsistent within themselves Not all the parties are on the same page all the time You need to deal with different people with different personalities and responsibility in one project And the real working contractors are another different group of people
6 Theyd break the fixtures you buy The stuff are all stored in the garage before getting used after long time they may not be able to find specific parts you prepared and claim them missing or parts may get scratched or broken due to careless handling so you end up buying same items twice
7 The raining season came before the roof was installed and they didnt do proper treatment to prevent water damage Only simple tarp was laid on the frame which collapsed in the evening storm and my existing living room was flooded because the rain leaked through the roofwall crack they made When I expressed my concern to them regarding the waterdamaged wood framewallfloor they simply shrugged it off saying itd dry out over time If they are real professional they should know that the waterdamaged wood will be distorted and becomes very hard even after drying out And the wall will not be evenly flat and becomes wavy in some sections
8 the floor in the extended living room area is not level with the existing flooring The flooring was fully renewed in the integrated living room but you can feel the slope in the extended area When the issue was brought to them Mike first said hed send some other guy to investigate it then that guy simply said he couldnt feel the difference and attributed it to the new wood accommodation 
9 they may do well if your project is quite standardized in that everything just gets replaced without any particular design change With not too many customization your project would be delayed In the beginning they claimed to complete my project in 6 months then it ended up to take 13 months
10 their secretarys attitude is very poor When they want to collect payment they want it right away and would harass you in email But when you request them to fix something theyd have various personal excuses 

Above are just the major pitfalls what I could remember after 13 months there are so many miscellaneous minor complains which I cannot list them all After all if you choose them you wont have peace in mind during your project and the journey will be winding as they are not professional enough to handle projects in modern style"
5,I worked with Baron Construction  Remodeling Co on several occasions photographing projects they completed Each time I was able to witness firsthand uncompromised quality of their work the beautiful functional designs attention to the smallest details happy home owners I am confident to recommend their services to even more discerning clients
5,"I would highly recommend Baron Construction  Remodeling  We were working with another GC to add a bathroom and new kitchen  The project was to have been completed in eight months  Instead it took more than a year and a half and the project was still not completed My husband and I were very stressed and frustrated as the GC and workers did not show up to work everyday  
Baron Construction was doing a remodel for three of my neighbors  They were all very happy with Baron Construction  We decided to part ways with our GC Mike decided to help us finish our project so we would pass our final inspection Needless to say we were  very happy and relieved to be working with Mike Baron  He checked the job site often and saw that things ran very smoothly for us  Everyone from the job crew to the office staff is very professional friendly and efficient  Very happy with the quality of their work Each project has been completed in a timely manner We still have little projects that they are helping us correct from the last GC  I would highly recommend them"
5,My wife and I wanted our old home to wear a new look So we consulted the Mike of Baron Construction with his crew to make our dream come true The task was deftly executed and each day ends with a general cleaning even till the last day of the work Our experience with them was quite awesome  every time they resume work the atmosphere seems like a family reunion Mike and his crew diffuse warmth and friendliness each day Now our home is a place of regular visit for our friends All thanks to Mike and his crew for their best shot that changed our old house forever into the best we can ever think of
5,I cant say enough how helpful Eli Levy and Mike Baron were in our construction project We started with a master bath and kids bath remodel but the project soon expanded to the entire upstairs Eli and crew were easy to work with extremely detail oriented and had great suggestions throughout the process Even as we expanded the scope of our project Eli kept the project moving and we were quickly finished with an entire floor remodel We couldnt be more happy with the results and even look forward to our next project
5,We really enjoyed our remodeling process with Baron We interviewed a couple of contractors and are glad that we made the right choice Eli has been really pleasant to work with from the very beginning through the end He is responsive professional and paid attention to details Luis and Emilio who worked onsite were fairly hardworking and friendly Though it took a bit longer and extra rework to install the tiles perfectly it was an overall smooth and efficient process We love our freshly updated home when we wake up every morning
5,I never thought that remodeling could be as hasslefree as Mike and his team made it to be Last year my husband and I had a grand plan to remodel our kitchen We had been getting into cooking and loved entertaining that we felt it was time to make the plunge I learned about Baron Construction from a friend who spoke very highly of them All I can say is that our decision to get our kitchen remodeled and to work with Mike has been ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS for our family ever The whole process went by smoothly We set up an estimate and then they promptly started with the work They made the house very livable and they were there to answer any questions Now the finished product was wonderful I dont know how we could have waited this long for the kitchen remodel We got our dream kitchen and even if our home was built in 1988 it made our house look brand new The cost was reasonable and very worth it due to high quality Very satisfied and I cannot wait to get other parts of the home done by Mike and team too
5,Of all my years managing my home i have never encountered a contractor as reliable creative and efficient as Baron Construction These folks are the best and i would only trust remodeling my home with them They worked on my kitchen guest bedroom and living room and kept the place clean throughout the process It was very liveable to come home They respected the place and did a fantastic final job at a great price I never knew my kitchen could look like one out of the magazines but they gave very useful design advice I would get them again for all future jobs Communication was polite and very consistent as well Six stars
5,I am not a fan of remodeling projects I am always worried that the time and effort is too tedious for our household given that I work full time and manage a small business Mike and the team at Baron changed all of this Remodeling was hasslefree because they kept the entire house clean throughout the process They listened to us about what design we wanted and delivered on it Everytime we had a question the team was always one call away I never thought our bathroom and masters bedroom can look as beautiful as it is now Next my kitchen I will only trust them Great value for money Prices are on point and you can see the high quality
5,I used Baron for an extensive kitchen remodeling job as well as new flooring and ceilings  The management of the job was excellent with lots of design advice and guidance flexibility in accomodating my personal choices and high level of expertise in all phases and areas of the job which included complete demolition of the existing kitchen installing all rough plumbing and electrical new flooring tile and wood new cabinetry and painting throughout  Eli especially was terrific at managing the whole thing The crew was always respectful and courteous
5,When you work with Mike Eli Oded and Cheryl you get great customer service and amazing work Ive tried other contractors in the past but the quality of their work is literally the BEST in the market Highly recommend
5,My bathroom called for a muchneeded makeover I had been thinking about it for years I heard from a friend that renovating bathroom would increase value of the house so I said game lets do it I asked around for the best contractors in the South Bay and instantly got drawn to the team of Mike and Eli of Baron Construction in Saratoga From my first inquiry they were patient with taking me through the entire process  They came promptly for a free estimate They listened to my design and gave valuable inputs They were experts in constructing and were very efficient way  being sensitive to my budget and true to my vision The construction came and went and it was a breeze I did not stress about anything because they guided me throughout the process  plumbing design materials labor I couldnt be happier with the end result My bathroom is exactly how I imagined it and more I will definitely call them again for my future projects THEY ARE THE BEST
5,Best remodelers in the Bay Area They are extremely trustworthy no hidden costs and are patient in answering any questions I showed them a picture of my dream kitchen and everything exceeded my expectations  the finish seems very good the lighting is perfect and the paint is amazing They know their design stuff These guys are the real deal
5,Baron Construction has made my dream home a reality I never thought my patio and living room had the potential to be a designer home but they did it At a very reasonable price too Very satisfied with the work
5,"Baron woah  just  woahhh  amazing work done by guyz  love you guyz id prefer to hire you again one of my favourites in Saratoga  
me  my wife wants new kitchen  you guyz did the job very well great work indeed"
5, I am not a fan of remodeling projects I am always worried that the time and effort is too tedious for our household given that I work full time and manage a small business Mike and the team at Baron changed all of this Remodeling was hasslefree because they kept the entire house clean throughout the process They listened to us about what design we wanted and delivered on it Everytime we had a question the team was always one call away I never thought our bathroom and masters bedroom can look as beautiful as it is now Next my kitchen I will only trust them Great value for money Prices are on point and you can see the high quality
5,"Eli Levy of Baron Construction and his crew Luis and Fernando did an outstanding kitchen remodel  on time and within budget Eli was very patient with our first major renovation and helped us pick out flooring cabinets and handles backsplash countertops sink disposal and lighting Moreover he also brought the walls insulation electrical the junction box and smokeCO detectors up to code in the original time estimated Luis and Fernando were polite and worked long hours to finish their projects letting us know when they were starting or finishing for the day They cleaned up at the end of every day and Eli gave the kitchen a professional cleaning at the end They even did little extras like putting in a dimmer switch and installing an underthecounter toaster oven Our most positive renovation ever and I hardly recommend Eli Luis Fernando and Baron Construction
Mike and Carol C Menlo Park"
5,Baron Construction  Remodeling is the BEST contractor that I have EVER worked with The quality of workmanship is beyond excellent They were constantly in touch with us making sure we were satisfied with the work in process If we had a question they would immediately respond Fantastic Customer Care So if you want to have a Wow experience with a contractor just give them a call
5,My husband and I have been wanting to redo our kitchen and we finally had the opportunity to do so earlier this year Since we have never done any renovation project before we decided to research online and found a website that allowed us to reach out to several companies We collected 5 companies one of which is Baron Construction They were the first one to contact us via email We narrowed our choices down to three companies and set up appointments to meet with them We met Eli and we immediately connected We had a vision of how we wanted our kitchen to be and this is something out of the box Eli understood our vision despite it being different from most of his clients and he assured us every step of the way that he will carry out this vision This was very important to us Bottom line is after 8 weeks of patience our kitchen turned out to be what we had envisioned it to be Eli and Baron Construction delivered what they promised to deliver and we are very happy with the result We have since hosted parties at our home and have received very positive feedback on the kitchen We will not hesitate to recommend Eli and Baron Construction to my friends and family Keep up the good work
5,As remodeling jobs go ours was rather small under 50K but you would never know that from the attention we received from Mike and Eli at Baron Construction We had a minor problem with one of their subcontractors but it was resolved immediately and the bottom line is that the job was done in a timely manner and we are extremely pleased with the results Mikes design suggestions were spoton and without them the results would not have been as good as they were
5,While we did not hire Baron Construction for our current project given a preexisting relationship with another contractor we were very impressed by the professionalism and responsiveness of this company We contacted several firms and Baron stood out Jesse came to our home for an initial consultation and immediately followed up with another visit to go through the proposal in detail  and we found both the proposed scope and budget to be very fair We will definitely consider Baron in the future
5,"My parents shopped around for a while before Baron Co and Remodeling They made it worth the search Very respectful of our ideas and the kitchen was finished with great attention to detail Would recommend them to anyone May use them again for a bathroom
In the future"
5,My partner and I contracted Baron Construction after we bought our home  I was referred to him by a friend since she had previously hired him to do a bathroom upgrade Our wash room and kitchen needed an upgrade for what seemed to be the longest The previous owners had done little to no work on the house He did an amazing job Both my partner and I were left satisfied from the work done on both rooms Great attitude and great service
5,Very satisfied with this company and their services From the first consultation all the way down to the last day of business there was a sense of urgency and attention to my needs as the customer My kitchen had lots of work to be done so I was honestly surprised all deadlines were met All my requests were met even the paint in the downstairs bathroom came out exactly as I had envisioned I would recommend this companies services to anyone who wants a Grade A job done to turn their house into a home 
5,i Shopped around for a couple of companies asked around to friends and I still was not sure I was able to read about the company and had heard from a friend who had recently used their services to do the entrance of their home After the initial contact I knew this was the right choice The representative sent to my house was on time friendly and seemed to be interested in the overall look I was going for Even though I wanted a much more intricate look they were able to bring my idea to a reality and within the budget in a timely matter And most of all it was done according to HOA regulations I would seriously like to recommend them to my friends who need any jobs around the house
5,highly recommend this company I am so pleased with the work that Mike has done My kitchen looks brand new Was very respectful of my ideas as well Might have them do some more work for my home in the future
5,I could not be more pleased with the professionalism they have shown me The 2 bathrooms at my house needed some remodeling The sight of the floor the sink and the tub looked so outdated They did an amazing job in transforming it I couldnt be more happy to use my bathroom My son was surprised when he saw his bathroom They remodeled his tub as well as the flooring He is excited to finally take a bubble bath in it Their pricing is very fair the material they have is excellent and I loved how they take the time to listen to what you want especially if you are detail orientated like me This company has been so helpful that I will definitely refer them to friends and family
5,The estimate I was given was fair I received three other estimates and I feel I was given a fair quote for the work I wanted
5,"I contracted with Baron Construction a about 3 months ago I wanted to wait on writing review to make sure that the work was completed and in properly working condition 

From the very first initial call all the way through the completion of my kitchen and bathroom remodel my experience was amazing My husband and I had just purchased our first home which needed major upgrades and we were a bit scared for lack of better words that someone would see that we are a young couple and would take advantage of us a friend referred us to Baron Construction and  Mike was great He sat with us and listened to what we wanted and all of the ideas we had and made those ides come to life He even added an island which I though wouldnt be possible  He worked with us every step of the way  Our kitchen and bathrooms are beautiful 

We did end up going above our initial budget since his work is a bit pricey but in the end it was well worth it its true what they say you get what you paid for And we LOVE the end result The quality of his work speaks for itself Our house finally became a home and we couldnt be more pleased Thanks guys 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
5,My home needed a real make over Specially my patio and fireplace Im very picky on who I will have working in my home We had different vendors come out and give us estimates Baron Construction and Remodeling CO gave us that feeling that everything was going to be taken care of the way we wanted our home to look like From providing an estimate clear explanation on how things were going to be done from beginning to end and last but not least great customer service We were given the option to choose a date on when was more convenient to us for them to come work in our home of course within a range of dates they had available From the moment they arrived at our home until the moment we came back Everything was very well organized and on point Phenomenal structure and workflow With that being said I couldnt have chosen a better company to come and remodel our home Extremely satisfied with the remodeling Phenomenal work Baron Construction and Remodeling Co Most definitely will recommend and will keep you for future remodeling in our home
5,"My patio looks amazing I mean really And we wouldnt have been able to procure the perfect backyard without Baron They were smart helpful attentive and totally affordable As soon as they were done I knew I had to write a review  a really really good review 

From start to finish Eli and crew were totally on our side From planning to production they considered what we wanted and figured out a way to incorporate almost every single detail The finished result looked exactly like the picture I had in my head  my dream backyard was finally a reality 

I have to mention the price Most companies I spoke to before hand wanted an arm and leg just to talk but our guys at Baron quoted us appropriately AND our bill stayed the same from first quote to finished product  I couldnt believe it These guys are not only skilled but trustworthy too 

In the end we really loved working with them and would recommend to anyone looking for an equally positive experience with their remodel"
5,Right away I knew that this review would be a positive one  I have nothing but great things to say about the entire Baron construction crew From day one I felt fully informed with what needed to be done to retrofit our roof and the lead on the project kept us in the loop through every minuscule detail throughout the entire process Not only am I completely satisfied with our newly secured roof I HAVE to say that I felt completely secure having the team in and around my house unsupervised PLUS they cleaned up after themselves every single day How many construction companies can you say that about On top of that I got a fair price for the work they did which stayed relatively the same throughout the entire process No up sells or added costs for work they didnt explain to me in detail Overall we are more than happy with our choice  would definitely recommend Baron to anyone with retrofitting needs
5,"We hired them to make some major repairs to the exterior of an older home we just bought The repairs were related to dry rot and water damage to eaves and siding identified in the termite report

They listened to what we wanted done and our priorities They kept us informed as they progressed through the work and consulted us in a timely manner when needed They worked consistently but did not rush We were particularly concerned when we learned parts of our metal roof would have to be removed to do a proper repair We had no need to be concerned however because they did a great job of replacing all the roofing tiles so you could not even tell they had been removed We recently purchased this house and it is over 40 years old We had no idea if they would find other damage when the siding was removed They didnt and we really appreciated that they did not take advantage of us in that way

The workers were professional friendly and very skilled Everything they did looks great and we were surprised at what a great job they did matching the old paint  The siding repairs are not obvious and look fine with the rest of the siding that was untouched They cleaned up thoroughly when they were done too"
5,"After our second child was born I realized we needed to add another room to our home The problem was that I wasnt quite sure how we could do it because our was already cramped with small rooms After a few recommendations I called Baron Construction  Remodeling and told them the issue that I was having and they sent over a representative We went through my home and he quickly noticed that the attic could be turned into another room with a small staircase added It made perfect sense and the added stairs would not take up much room 
So after getting the estimate we set the appointment date and the work started on our new room From the start I noticed the professionalism and work ethic from Baron Construction  Remodeling who seemed eager to take on the challenge of building our new room in the attic During that time they worked with us when we had to be gone so that everything would flow smoothly To my surprise the job was completed a bit ahead of time and I was lead through the entire room to make sure it was to my specifications 
All in all I was very pleased with Baron Construction  Remodeling as they did a great job of creating a new room out of our unused attic space Now we have the extra room in our home needed all for a price that fit our budget I cannot recommend the professionals at Baron Construction  Remodeling enough for their work"
5,"We reached out to several different vendors but decided to go with Baron even though they werent the cheapest  We were naturally skeptical in having a relationship with any contractor but our conversations with Mike and Eli regarding the finer points of the work estimate and the timeliness schedule of the work gave us the confidence we were looking for so we pulled the trigger and went with Baron  We made sure to be as flexible as we could be regarding timing and I stayed in the house for the duration of the work
The day before the work started Eli called me to make sure I knew what to expect as this was my first remodel of this scope  Eli came out to the site and we talked through where the majority of the work was going to take place and what I could expect during and after the construction on each day  I work from home and was able to spend quite a bit of time being annoying and poking around the worksite asking questions of the various crews that wereperforming work foundation framing plumming etc  Id talk with Eli every couple of days and they were very flexible with my indecision and periodic changes  My wife went back and forth on what she wanted to do about a dozen times and Eli had the patience of a saint and made sure we got what we wanted
Overall the various crews were neat punctual and friendly and the management was available and attentive  I was able to speak to someone when I needed to and they were understanding in how stressful this process can be for a homeowner  These guys were great I highly recommend them"
5,"My husband and I were referred to Baron by two different sources  the top pick from an online search by Home Advisor and by my friends parents I was able to see my friends parents recent kitchen remodel that was completed by Barons project manager Eli Levy and his crew from Baron Construction We own a 68 year old home and planned to remove a load bearing wall which separated our kitchen and living room in order to have an open concept living space We also had our one and only main bathroom of the house completely remodeled by Baron as well 

We met with Eli shortly after we signed all of the paperwork to begin the job in order to select the products that we wanted in our kitchen and bathroom at the warehouse and showroom Elis expertise and eye for design really helped in the process of shopping for our dream kitchen The estimated timeline when we signed on to complete the job from start to finish was about 8 weeksWe worked with Baron and the structural engineer and they were able to completely hide the massive loadbearing beam into the ceiling so the look of the kitchen and living space is seamless and beautiful 

Of course with all construction projects it is crucial to constantly check on the contractors work and job progress My husband and I went to check on the house on a daily basis and always communicated with Eli on any issues that we had We hired a moving company and completely moved out of our 3bedroom home so that construction could be completed by Baron Every room in the house was touched so it was crucial for us as homeowners with a young infant child to be away from the construction zone  Eli was always very professional and accommodating to work with as were all of the contractors that came to complete the job The contractors from Baron were extremely hardworking and friendly and everything was communicated in the proper chain of command 

Overall the project timeline took about 4 months to complete I am happy to say that we are now living in a beautiful almost brand new 68 year old home and are very pleased with the layout and design of our new kitchen and bathroom The experience of remodeling a home is definitely stressful and sometimes was not fun but the end result is night and day Baron does good quality work but it is always important to check on the progress of your project as the homeowner and as the customer"
5,They are very professional  knowledgeable Their is some of the best work we have experienced in a long time Issues are dealt with promptly and customer satisfaction is clearly a priority Highly recommended
5,"Baron Construction is a excellent company We would definitely hire them again
We had learned that there was a serious problem under the house while having electrical work done The concrete foundations at the bottom of the pier pilings were disintegrating 
We left voice messages with several different contractors and foundation companies that we researched online but many did not call back Even more did not keep appointments
Eli Levy of Baron Construction was the exception He made a timely appointment and arrived when scheduled Although we had been doing research online regarding foundations this was a fairly grey area to us When Eli came and looked in detail under the house he informed us the problem was bigger that we had at first thought We only had piers on half on the house
While talking over the work that must be done and the age and condition of the house we brought up the condition of the roof Eli looked at the roof and saw the sagging areas that we pointed out We talked about El Nino and stared talking about roof repairs It turned out that the roof was in worse shape that it looked on the surface in fact there was no plywood base and only 2 layers of failing shingles one wood the original roof deck
We negotiated an excellent price by being flexible with start and finish dates We even ended up having Eli use one of his excellent crews to do major internal painting in the house
All inspections were passed on the 1st visit with flying colors If you need work on your house big or small new or old we heartily recommend speaking to Eli Levy before signing contracts with anyone else"
5,"We first find Baron construction and remodeling on Angies list they have highly recommended reviews we had Mike come to our house to give us an estimate after we reviewed 3 others 20 minutes in to the meeting we knew that Baron Construction is the company to do our project
Mike gave us amazing ideas as how we can enlarge our kitchen he is the only contractor that listen to my needs for more storage space and also the only one that came up with the solution for that at the first meeting he also able to fit an island they gave me my dream kitchen there price was higher then the others but its worth it  when you meet them at the first time you will notice the difference and the professionalism along the process i met all there crew members and it was amazing to see how they all taking pride of what they do
The company spirit transfer to every one of the workers they also helped us to find the wright budget for our project and make sure we are not over spending there guys always came on time we will use them in the near future for our bathroom remodeling project we are recommending them to everyone and to all our friends"
5,"The Baron Construction and Remodeling demoed the entire kitchen and remodeled all the counters and installed new cabinets They also installed all the appliances Ensured that the new kitchen meets all the new building codes Baron Construction and Remodeling did a very professional job and taking our requests and suggestions into consideration All the workers are polite and professional The project leader Eli Levy is very attentive and visited the job site frequently The owner Mike Baron also paid several visits personally They also built a custom bench for our kitchen nook which turned out very nice

For the downstairs bathroom they also demoed the entire bathroom and built the shower from scratch They did a great job on the tile for the shower It is the most beautiful shower in the house now 

I would recommend Baron Construction and Remodeling to my friends and other people"
5,Mike and Eli did an amazing job on our kitchen remodel and bathrooms Very professional and took care of any issues that came up immediately  They really support the client The job was beautiful No delays except in our part with our gorgeous back splash I would highly recommend My friends who have seen the kitchen comment on the fact that its beautiful and looks like it should be in a designer magazine You do get what you pay for and I would do it again
5,"I would highly recommend Baron Construction for your next project and heres why  We had a bedroom remodel and Josue and the Baron Construction team were very professional from Day 1  When they came in to scope out the work we were provided with an estimate at the same time  with an initial write up of the contract  We also received documentation on their licenses bond and insurance  all on the first meeting  Baron Construction was able to start our project a few days after we had signed the contract  

Once the project started the team was very conscious to cover the floors and other areas to make sure it wouldnt be impacted from the work  They had estimated 2 weeks to complete the work and came within that timeframe  Our bedroom remodel included replacement of ceiling due to leak from bathroom above check for additional leaks texturize ceiling and paint installation of recessed lighting painting of walls and closet interior replacement of carpet with new flooring and new baseboards

We were impressed with their commitment to the quality of their work and made sure we were happy along the way  If you have home improvement projects in mind I would recommend Baron Construction  I know well definitely keep them in mind for our next project"
5,"First they came and give us an estimate that we really liked we signed the contract to do the kitchen floors
Before they started  the job I ask them to give me a price for the complete kitchen remodeling
again we liked the price and we signed the contract BTW they helped us with financing the job
during the process we found out the electrical wiring needs to be replaced mike gave us very good price on that so we let them do it
they also gave us 3D design rendering that was great we actually could see how the kitchen will look like 
Roy Mike and the team where very helpful they answered all of our concerns and even when we change things around they where very understanding and helped us to make our dream come true
we where very impressed when all city inspection pass at the first time
we love how our kitchen came out it looks amazing like it came out of a catalog its like living in a mention 
we will use Baron construction again to do our roof in the in the near future
they did exactly what they promise and above
we are extremely happy that we choose Baron construction and remodeling  to do our kitchen"
5,My kitchen remodel is so beautiful  The project manager communicated effectively so were kept informed of timelines and next steps Our designer listed to what we wanted and helped us create our dream kitchen All of the contractors were very professional and treated my home respectively
5,I had an absolute blast doing my kitchen remodel with Beatris Gross she was absolutely fantastic Confident professional knowledgeable and with a real eye for design choices the kitchen looks even better than I would have hoped she had a real knack for not only answering all of my questions but taking what my wife and I wanted to do with our kitchen and making it part of the whole project Absolutely I will be working with her again for any remodeling projects
5,Treeium and specifically Beatris Gross and her entire team are worth every penny No matter the size of the project you can tell they all care about the details and doing things right the first time I never had to wonder if this work was up to code They are experts and artists in what they do and every single crew was respectful skilled and honest We have found our contractor for every other project We needed someone to guide us through the kitchen renovation process and we found that in Beatris We love our new kitchen and cant wait for future work
5,Our home renovation couldnt have been completed without the great work from Treeium We added 400 sq ft to our home turning it from a 3 bed2bath to 4 bed2 bath large open concept with new kitchen  dining room Like any home reno there were some unexpected items but Sam  the team worked with us to prioritize what we wanted and needed We love how everything turned out I highly recommend this team
1,Treeium recently completed the remodel of a portion of my home and a detached garage to create two apartments ADUs Unfortunately my experience was very negative and fraught with tension disagreement and arguments Most importantly the project was scheduled to be completed in 35 months but took over 7 months to complete without a reasonable cause for the delay Additionally they repeatedly touted their years of experience and expertise which caused me great concern when I discovered that their contracts payment schedule forced me to pay large sums of money for work that had not been completed On a positive note their sales pitch and marketing are exceptional
5,We used Treeium for a complete new kitchen and bathroom From the  start to the finish we were guided along each step of the way by Beatris the wonderful project manager who worked on it She was there to assist us with every single decision that we had to make She gave us details about each product and offered excellent suggestions and then allowed us to make the final decision She is very knowledgeable about everything that her job entails and extremely precise with even the small details thus assuring that the end results will be exceptional We loved her for that Over the duration of the project she also showed kindness and consideration in that she willingly made adjustments to do things at a later time of the day to suit our schedule  and even assisted us in getting a driving cart in the stores when necessary due to health issues Overall we think that Beatris went above and beyond the requirements of her job and we are absolutely pleased with the job done We would definitely recommend Treeium and Beatris to everyone We are so delighted to have a beautiful new kitchen and bathroom
5,"Treeium is awesome Seriously the most incredible discovery Ive made We had a complex project 2 walls a bifold door and glass and Treeium handled it flawlessly Several other larger companies that I contacted stated that they would be unable to come in for another week implying that someone would be sleeping in the living room and that their charges were significantly higher without tax Treeium was cost effective wellorganized and extremely efficient Sebastian phoned back to confirm and even offered to come earlier in the day on Saturday recognizing that work into the afternoonevening would cause complications in our building Sebastian and his team performed miracles in a matter of hours and the wall beyond our expectations We were blown away by their professionalism and friendliness especially on such a frantic movein day

After the wall was done we intended to add plexiglass to the top but were unable to do so due to a lack of materials Sebastian contacted the next day to set a time for early Monday morning to come finish the repair and allow me to continue working later in the day He did a wonderful job and it gives even more privacy while maintaining the rooms natural light

Sebastian and the entire team at Treeium did an excellent job Thank you guys"
5,Weve had an amazing experience with Treeium In and out in a flash with a flawless product Weve utilized them on numerous occasions for largescale projects and theyve always started and finished on schedule After the workers departed one of the projects I identified a minor issue that needed to be addressed I contacted Sebastian and he answered instantly and arrived the next day to resolve the issue without charging me further fees Impeccable service and overall great quality products
4,Eran was friendly and professional from the beginning  I loved the 3D design at the beginning  It allowed us to be more specific in the material selections  It was really a great experience working with Eran and Treeium  And the bathroom looked even more beautiful than we imagined I highly recommend them both for any future remodels
5,"Treeium did everything that they promised to do and did it in less time than originally estimated  Our Project Manager AmirTeymouri was nothing short of amazing  He stopped by the project every day just to check in and make sure we didnt have any questions  Not only that but he always answered my calls or texts within a few minuteseven on Saturday or after hours  

I have heard and had horror stories about contractors but not the case with Treeium I can assure you that Amir will be our only call when we are ready for the next project"
5,There was a leak from the shower pipes that went unnoticed for months When discovered the damage was too extensive so we decided to bite the bullet and remodel Treeium outperformed my expectations with the bathroom remodeling project I had the pleasure to work with Beatris Gross who exemplifies the meaning of customer service and delivers on her commitments She was attentive to all of my inquiries responding immediately I was 400 miles away during the remodel and she kept me apprised at every single step through phone calls texts and pictures I appreciated her remodeling expertise and eye for detail The workers on the remodel are masters of their crafts not jacks of all trades This gives me the assurance the work was done correctly No more leaks The project was finished within the time frame stated and I am very pleased with the result I highly recommend Beatris  And I would definitely work with her again
5,they were wonder to work with I would recommend them without hesitation They were professional pleasant and responsive ok ok
5,Farid and his team from Treeium did an excellent job remodeling our bathroom The end result was better than we imagined Farid was responsive completed the job on time and there werent any surprises in cost We will use Farid Ghaheri and his team when we are ready to remodel our kitchen
1,SPENT   GOT NOWHERE  I had an awful experience with this company  They were paid for their professional expertise to assess whether a simple balcony could be built  Upon their assurance that it could be I engaged upon the next phase of the project  After several months and additional payment they informed me that it could not be done  Rather than taking responsibility for their error and refunding the second payment they decided to double down and charge me more  UNETHICAL UNREASONABLE UNRELIABLE
5,We had a storage room off the garage converted to a studio apartment The project managers Dorel Zander and Lior Lazrovich their  architect designers and work crews were friendly and excellent at what they do  Even with the issues that the City raised about the property and physical challenges  they were willing to work with us within our budget to get the job completed within the time frame we were working with  Dorel and Lior stayed in constant contact with us throughout the project particularly with the stages of the remodel and the city inspections They were always very responsive to any questions or concerns we had and addressed them fully   The bathroom and kitchenette look terrific  Very pleased with the overall experience
5,The company with Avram and Eran Dukeman were very helpful in guiding us through the entire project remodeling our entire kitchen and 2 bathrooms They were always clear about choices to be made and when changes were necessary They also tended to spot problems before we noticed them Good guidance all through the entire project
2,I would steer clear of this company  They started my kitchen remodel August 3 and it is October 29 and it is not yet complete  There have been 28 working days that there were no workers at the house  The foreman never comes around nor does the project manager    Several times the inspector came to the house and no one from Treeium was there to meet them  I asked for my concerns to be escalated and was told management were all busy  The communication from the project manager to the workers is horrible  The cabinet guys had no idea we were to have toekick drawers or certain pullouts  I asked one of the workers who is giving you direction and they indicated the direction was coming from me I call the phone number and there is an option to select 3 to discuss concerns with a project but when you select 3 you receive an error message and it disconnects you The only saving grace is that the kitchen looks really nice and I am pleased with it but the process to get there was horrible
5,"Treeium remodeled two of our bathrooms and we couldnt be more pleased with the result Everything was completed professionally on time and within our budget Dorel Zender is excellent as a project manager He is client focused very professional and has an excellent demeanor for working with people anxious about having work done on their home 

We are currently using Treeium to convert a window in one of our bedrooms into a sliding glass door along with adding a deck to allow us better access to our yard Everything has been going well

I definitely recommend Treeium and you would be fortunate to have Dorel as your project manager"
5,"Our home was in desperate need of a remodel it needed everything new roof flooring re wire  re plumb four bathrooms game room and a kitchen Basically our home was a gut job  I had been dreaming of a remodel for years Needless to say we were nervous about hiring a company that could handle such a big project After talking to numerous contractors I was becoming discouraged no real quotes and no time lines  Then I discovered Treeium and knew I had found a company that I could trust with a 12 million Dollar renovation
Shahar Algazy has been nothing short of amazing treating our home like his own and diligently keeping everything on time and on budget if not Below  Everyday since we began Shahar has had a 10 man crew on the job practically unheard  of with most companies When it came time to upgrade the electric panel we were faced with the possible need to destroy a large portion of  our yard and cut down a  beautiful and stately tree that is a major feature in our yard Shahar could have left it at that but he went the extra  mile to find a better solution Shahar saved us 30K and our beloved ficus tree
We continue to be impressed with Treeiums customer service and communication The Treeium portal is very easy to navigate and keeps everything clear and organized We love the gallery that lets our friends and family keep track of the  progress Great work Treeium and Shahar Algazy for talking such good care of our home"
5,"My wife and I were looking to completely open up our kitchen and bring into a modern aesthetic As you can see in the pictures we had a very cramped galley style kitchen with 80s style red oak and old appliances  

Our project managers Lior Lazarovich and Dorel Zander were very easy to work with and understood what we were looking for and made sure to incorporate our needs throughout the design They were able to remove two major walls to open up the kitchen and their designer Natali did an amazing job of reconfiguring the cabinets to give us an ample amount of storage

Overall Id highly recommend working with Treeium and specifically with Lior and Dorel  They were very professional always attentive to our numerous texts and concerns even on the weekends we were those annoying clients lol They handled everything with an easy going nature that was straightforward and honest We look forward to working with them again on any projects we have in the future Thanks guys"
5,Having never done such a major project I was more than a little apprehensive about the timeline but my project manager Beatris Gross made sure everything kept moving  It took just one month from start to finish  Everyone who worked on my kitchen was knowledgeable and professional  Beatris spent hours helping me choose just the right materials to complete my vision for a new kitchen  I would definitely recommend this company
5,"Three months ago we finished our project with Treeium successfully
Farid  Gabriel played a fundamental role during the entire process which included dealing with architects engineers city codes and builders They both were very accommodating patient and extremely professional  
Our project was a major home remodel 90 It took less than five months from the moment the plans were approved to completion
We hired Treeium to ensure our home was built structurally safe  sound and thats what they delivered Have already recommended them to several people"
5,We recently remodeled our master bathroom  We gutted the entire space and put in both a half bath and a full master  We could not have been more pleased with Treeium the contractor we worked with on this project  We recommend them highly and plan to have them return to do our kitchen  Contract Treeium for all your remodeling needs  8558338733 and ask for Dorel or Lior
5,"My wife and I are retired and decided to invest in our home of 35 years in Irvine by upgrading all three bathrooms We had remodeled them only once before and did not have much money at the time and we were determined to get it right this time

We decided against hiring an interior designer so we interviewed contractors that were larger firms with good resources like a Project Manager that would come onsite weekly and see the project thru from beginning to end We knew we would pay a little more for that level of service We decided on Treeium after meeting a few times with our Project Manager Amir Teymouri

Amir made us really comfortable with the depth of his remodel knowledge gave us very credible  design ideas  and excelled at both his verbal and written communications That combined with Treeiums size 100M in annual sales discounts with major suppliers of bath fixtures  and tile Were ket you decision along with the excellent ratings on Yelp Houzz etc So we signed a contract for all 3 bathrooms with Amir

Amir did exactly as he said he would by monitoring his crews work visiting our home several times a week to check on progress ask us about how we liked the work and communicating to us clearly as to schedule and what materials or decisions were needed and when from us

Amir has terrific contacts with key suppliers like bathroom fixtures tile stores shower enclosures etc and those relationships really helped when issues would present themselves For example our supplier for the master bath sold us the wrong roughin valve which was already installed and tiled over for the filler tube for our soaker tub Amir handled all the conversations with the supplier and presented us with 3 different alternative replacements for the tube filler that would fit the already installed roughin valve
 Treeium is a very good company but as always its the people that make the difference In my opinion Amir is a very good Project Manager and has a very good team supporting him I would highly recommend Treeium and especially Amir Teymouri for your home remodel needs

Bottom line could not be happier with the final competition of all 3 bathrooms  I was so satisfied midway with through the project I signed another contract to have Treeium paint the exterior of my house and they did a terrific job on that as well"
5,"Treeium is not necessarily the most cost efficient company Id you shop around but you certainly get what you pay for with contractors As a company it was very professional the portal is great you have licensed contractors that are insured at all times Our process was timely transparent and on budget which is all we can ask for 
My review is actually in support of our project managercontractor Amir He went above and beyond for our project before during and after construction He was available for questions at all hours gave honest feedback and worked with us to find great solutions Our kitchen resurfacing was painless and Amir made sure it was finished to perfection down to the last detail 

We have recommended Amir and therefore Treeium to several colleagues and friends and would certainly recommend him and the Treeium team to anyone looking for painless remodeling"
5,"Lior Lazarovich is an outstanding project manager He has really looked out for me throughout the remodal process His daily communication was indispensable I looked forward to the texts they kept me apprised every step of the way Lior Lazarovich built trust with his strong communication and  his attention to detail He made me feel relaxed through the process and I am very happy and excited by the results My kitchen is everything I could have asked for

If I ever do another remodal I would just call Lior"
5,We recently had a four season sunroom addition built at our house Our project was managed by Medhi Heshmati and Amir Teymouri and we couldnt have asked for more professional and communicative project managers From the start they were with us helping us plan out our sunroom to our budget and explaining all the steps and processes involved They let us know the approximate timeline for start of construction and what would be involved and provided suggestions on best practices that would result in a highest end quality for our budget The build team was professional and always courteous and were very receptive and responsive to any questions and issues we had From start to finish the project was streamlined and on target and we are very satisfied with the end result I will definitely be calling up Mehdi and Amir for future remodels and would not hesitate to recommend them to friends and family
5,Thanks to Lior Lazarovich Dorel Zander and the Treeium team for the transformation of my parents home The timeline and communication throughout the remodel process was great Especially with my busy schedule All the work was very efficient and thorough Very satisfied Would recommend to anyone looking to remodel
5,"Last November I started calling around to get some quotes for remodeling my master bathroom  Id set a budget and wanted to plan ahead to keep the project on track  Id calculated that the best time for the work to begin would be FebruaryMarch 2020   Some of the contractors I called turned me down because the work wouldnt be starting immediately  But when I called Treeium the response couldnt have been more different   

Right from our first meeting project managers Shahar Shawn Algazy and Guy Borenstein listened to my wishlist got a sense of my aesthetic and started making suggestions to realize my vision  Their advice about materials and 3D rendering of the design were especially reassuring for someone undertaking a remodel on this scale for the first time

The whole process has unfolded so smoothly   Ive been kept in the loop every step of the way   Shahar in particular has stopped by regularly to make sure everything has been going to plan  The crew has been consistently on time amazingly friendly and polite and very considerate in cleaning up at the end of each day    The team effort and spirit at Treeium is truly outstanding  everyone Ive talked with has contributed to realizing this vision  Shahar and Guy are truly amazing  Im extremely grateful and very happy to be part of the Treeium family   Thoroughly recommended"
5,Medhi was great to work with He answered all my questions and provided a detailed scope of work on the bid Adjusted it multiple times to meet my needs before even signing a contract His foreman and crew were efficient and courteous They completed the job on ahead of schedule and passed all inspections with ease the remodel of our bathroom was amazing I would recommend them to anybody
5,"A few months after our massive job was completed new electrical new walls new floors new doors new HVAC etc we noticed that a couple of our barn doors were starting to stick a bit When we reached out to Gina at Treeium she had a crew out to us the next business day to take care of it free of charge

The crew was in and out and took care of the two doors without any fuss We really appreciated that Treeium came out so quickly and for free in order to make sure we were fully satisfied with their work"
5,Treeium is great to work with Professional knowledgeable and an overall great experience Guy Shahar Eli and Maya are my team  They have earned my trust as we are halfway through my complete remodel and addition  I can sleep better knowing my home is in their hands
5,I worked with Eli at Treeium over 3 12 months  remodeling two bathrooms From our first conversation to the last Eli was a pleasure to work with and Treeium did not disappoint Our remodeling was IMHO pretty extensive  new sinks new vanities new toilets new lighting new stall shower new floors new tile and so on The only thing we didnt replace was the bathtub  because Eli recognized that it could be refinished and look like new which it did We also did some structural work reconfiguring a closet and also changing a doorway I had a million decisions to make in the process of selecting materials tile flooring countertops etc  and so I was in steady contact with Eli to make sure what I was picking out would meet code requirements and would work within the constraints of our bathrooms eg making sure the stall shower wasnt too large for the space He was always fast in responding patient in answering my questions and helpful in providing the necessary information Treeiums team was also great  from the folks who handled the loan to the foreman of the job to the workers who did the actual work Everyone was friendly competent FAST and professional On many days I was out of town and I had no hesitation leaving them a key in a lock box and letting them work without my actually being there If they ran into a problem or a question they contact me  so I never had to worry that they would make a decision in my absence that I wouldnt agree with Eli said the first bathroom would take 3 weeks and the second master bathroom would take 4 weeks And he was true to his word Even allowing for wasted days due to holidays or waiting for city inspections the projects were complete in 7 weeks I would definitely work with Treeium again and with Eli in particular
5,"We just had two bathrooms remodeled by Treeium  Lior the project manager made sure that all was on schedule  the crews the suppliers and us  We are very happy with the new bathrooms in our home

 

The contract said the job would be done in 78 weeks it was done in 5 weeks  Lior is a taskmaster in the best sense of the word  He is also a cheerleader  He kept us all in line by reminding us of our responsibilities He was at the site every day  His crew was friendly conscientious and efficient

 

We live approximately seven hours drive from the construction site and had several trips planned during the reconstruction  Prior to starting the project we were supplied detailed schematics as well as a designers full color rendering of what the bathrooms would look like on completion  As a result we were able to follow the work via skype or photos which Lior supplied daily  We made minor changes along the way  Lior was always positive and gave great advice in relation to costs etc  We were told exactly how much the project or changes we made would cost there were no surprises when the work was completed   

 

We are more than happy with the work done by Treeium  We plan to keep on using Treeium for the rest of our renovations because of the fine work done by the crews and the direction of Lior the project manager"
5,"This was my first remodel  I was very fortunate to find Amir of Treeium to do my master bathroom renovation

From the very first meeting with Amir I knew this was the right fit  He was told me about the company showed me various jobs he was in charge of as the project manager  He walked me through the process and made me feel confident that Treeium and Amir were right for the job

The remodel went like clockwork and was completed ON TIME Amir was at the job site almost daily and was always available by text or phone including weekends and holidays When in doubt I relied upon his expertise and he never steered my wrong Amir kept me informed throughout the process He always told me at the close of work what the next day would be I appreciated his attention to detail and his honesty  I always felt I was in good hands

Not only is Amir wonderful but so are his team  They were very polite cordial and without too much interference with my day  They cleaned up daily and the dust was minimal due to the plastic tarp taped to adjoining rooms I have a small dog and they were always careful to keep the front door closed so she would not escape  

After hearing all the horror stories from others about a remodel I feel very lucky to have found Amir He made the remodel flow easily and flawlessly If I need any renovations in the future I will call Amir"
5,We hired Treeium to do our second story bedroom and bathroom addition It was a big job for us and took almost 6 months Beatris Gross was our project manager and we were so grateful for her She ensured the work be done right and to our liking on everything She always responded to our phone calls and texts immediately We have small children and she was very careful to ensure the home was safe the whole time Beatris has great taste and helped us pick beautiful finishes for our room I highly recommend asking for her when you do your job She was a joy to work with
5,Guy has been very good very thrall with great project management and communication He is always checking on the project and the progress my wife Merrillyn and I have been very pleased with Guy Breuer He is an excellent project manager Thank you for the great experience
5,"The company was very professional
And I trusted them above the other five that came out to give me an estimate and they were competitive"
5,We are just finishing up a bathroom remodel with Treeium  Etel Littman was our project manager and from the very first meeting Etel was just fantastic  She listened to our fuzzy ideas and asked great clarifying questions to focus on what we really wanted  This is our first remodel experience and she made it wonderful and easy  She really walked us through the process the whole way and helped us protect ourselves from less honest contractors  Our final inspection is tomorrow and the bathroom is just perfect  The work quality was fabulous and the team of workers were always polite conscientious and hard working  It was such a great process that I recommended Etel and Treeium to my mother who also wants to remodel her bathroom I trust Etel to do a great job and to live up to my mothers demands  If you are looking to remodel your home Treeium is just a great company
5,Guy Breuer is an awesome project manager for Treeium  He is very knowledgeable friendly and attends to my questions in a timely manner  He checks in frequently with me both by phone and email to keep me apprised of my bathroom remodels progress  Treeium has been a great choice for me and I highly recommend Treeium to anyone needing remodeling done
5,The whole Treeium team was terrific  Guy Breuer was the project manager  Big kudoson time within scope and on budget  Cant ask for more except for the finished product which has had nothing but rave reviews from everyone whos seen the kitchen
5,Forbes magazine was right that is all I got to say  If you are looking to make your home more efficient  to lower your costs overall from your home this is where you will make the final decision Treeium was referred to me by neighbor in Sherman Oaks we really help each other out to make sure our community and our homes look and live on its best My home was over 70 Years old and only thing I did was change attic insulation once no difference Treeium came  showed me suggestions and I ended up going with an self efficient smart home  my living Costs from my home have dropped a drastic 35 percent in costs I didnt think this was possible but they made it possible on top of that  they went ahead and planted a tree for remodeling my home to an efficient environment friendly homethey really do care about the environment just like it mentioned in the article I must say they deserve 10 stars not 5 thank you once again for educating me and helping my family live a better and more earth friendly life
5,We worked with Shahar Algazy and Maya Orlova on our kitchen bath and wet bar remodel  Treeium is proactive on time within budget and provides high quality work Having a large team and industry network enabled them to keep the project moving forward
5,Treeium is an excellent company that I have been working with but the individual that should be recognized by everyone is Etel Littman because of her fantastic customer service that continues to drive Treeium to success I am thankful for Etels high quality customer service she never lets me down or anyone that I know An example of her excellent service was her knowledge in design and ability to work efficiently with me in providing best pricing and quality material to all customers on time
5,We are working with Etel from Treeium She has been a great project manager for us thus far She has been very approachable available and has helped guide us in our ongoing kitchen remodel
5,My husband and I got bids from 7 contractors and decided to move forward with our kitchen remodel with Treeium A few of the quotes came in at similar prices so what won us over was our project manager Etel Littman From the first meeting until now communication has been clear and straightforward She was one of the only people to educate us on how to do our homework on a contractor  together we went onto the CSLB website to compare all the companies and overall we liked what Treeium has to offer Through the process of picking our materials Etel has also been very flexible and accommodating meeting us at tile stores trying to find us the best pricing and even dropping off samples to our home on a Sunday Demo starts soon and Im looking forward to the kitchen of our dreams I feel our kitchen will be in good hands with this company and project manager
5,"I used Guy Borenstein from Treeium for a huge project last year I had my entire kitchen and living room remodeled and upgraded I was extremely happy with the quality of their work and the caliber of all the workmen that Guy Borenstein has on his team  Their work exceeded all my expectations 
I am in the process of remodeling my back yard and bbq area and Guy Borenstein is back to the drawing board  There is no other contractor I will work with
Cant wait to see the end result"
5,The 60year old sink in our rental property required serious work Because they seemed to be the most sincere about fixing our problem we hired Treeium Inc in Valley Village to do the work Guy Borenstein was the Project Manager and Elizabeth Camarena was the site supervisor Like most projects we anticipated a certain level of anxiety until the job was complete but Guy and Elizabeth made this project virtually stressfree for us The finished work is beautiful and when we do further upgrades we will consider Treeium as our first choice
5,Treeium is an excellent company and Guy Borenstein is an amazing contractor The company truly cares about their clients and tries their best to be respectful and accommodating during what can be a very difficult time I have done many projects with Treeium and Guy Borenstein and I look forward to building the ADU that is our next project I know it will be done with excellent quality given the multiple projects I have already done with Guy and Treeium
5,Being our first remodel my husband and I were a bit anxious about the whole process From the beginning the project manager with Treeium Etel Littman was great She was very informative and thoroughly explained what to expect  Also she provided great ideas from the materials colors and design Etel was super attentive to details and she has been a pleasure to work with We look forward to our new home
5,Ive worked with Treeium on three different projects including two bath remodels and the best thing about them is their desire to accommodate the needs and requests of the customer They also have great post project support  In the last project the project managers Farid Ghaheri and Amir Teimouri were accommodating flexible and patient In addition Jose Castillo who did all the work was very patient and professional Jose does high quality work and has great attention to detail  Treeium is a good choice because of their customer service and post project support
5,Treeium was professional and really cared about our satisfaction through the entire process From my initial contact they were very responsive I started contacting different places to learn about bathroom and kitchen remodeling and decided to give Treeium a call I was super pleased with my initial phone consultation and decided to schedule to have a field estimator out to see the projects and provide a bid The estimator was very friendly and had a ton of knowledge in the processes and different bathroom and kitchen upgrades available After meeting with a couple of establishments it was clear to us that Treeium was the company for our projects The crew and project manager were absolute professionals We are 100 satisfied and recommend Treeium to our family and friends Thank you
5,"I have a small project with Treeium My project manager is Shahar Algazy They really give me a good help to finish my project I owned an apartment since August 2018 I hired a contractor right after I own the place but they took my deposit and did not do anything for 6 months which made me into a really bad situation Then I found Treeium on Yelp Lucky they went in the next day after I contact them and give me a big help My HOA is so hard to communicate It took us a month to start the project Shahar even went to my HOA meeting to explain how our project going to do I have never heard that any contractor will come to the meet especially for a small project Finally we got the approval letter and start the project Since then everything goes very smooth Shahar come almost everyday to see how the work is going I must mention Roy and his buddy They do everything perfectly even surprise the inspector They use all good and expensive things to make sure everything they did is in a perfect shape Then the patching guys and painting guys came in after To be honors the patching guys and painting guys are just alright nothing bad I think I just spoiled However they still help me a lot on those small projects which belong to myself and not on the contract for free After a month working My apartment finally turns into what I was looking for Shahar is a nice project manager As a contractor he gave me a lot of suggestions from the customer side which I believe he can make bigger money without those suggestion To be the truth Shahar becomes my friend instead of just a project manager If you are looking for a contractor Talk to Treeium and ask Shahar as your project manager You wont find any project manager who will pick up your phone almost 247 and tell you what the best option is and what the cheapest option is to achieve your goal Also if possible ask Shahar to bring Roy and his buddy in which will make sure your electric has no problem and shock the inspector because of the nice job 
As a review I should let them know that their painters need to improve they job Nice people as well but can be better Especially after I have Shahar and Roy I feel they should be better to be called Treeium
Thank you Treeium to help me finish my project and give me a lot of help on the small things that I planned to do myself in order to save money"
5,Treeium is an outstanding company and I loved working with my project manager Guy  I live in NY and was doing a bathroom remodel in my San Diego condo long distance  Guys communication was excellent and he handled everything for me  The workmanship was terrific  the bathroom is stunning  And my sister who lives there said his crew was very polite very neat and very punctual   I highly recommend Treeium and would use them again in a heartbeat
5,Treeium is an excellent extremely professional company They worked fast and efficiently and created a beautiful new bathroom for us The quality of the work is outstanding and the entire team of specialists  work together to do an outstanding job We have now hired them to remodel our kitchen a second bathroom as well as other rooms in our home We would like to thank our contractor Lior Lazarovich and his entire team for a job super well done Thank you
5,"Awesome guy  and  Professional Individual 
I wasnt aware about Knowledge and skills Very confident in many areas and topics  Easy and direct conversation within professional manner"
5,"Treeium has just completed our downtothestuds remodel of a 1977 guest bathroom  Our initial contact was with Tomer Turjeman  He was pleasant and informative on the telephone arrived promptly and answered all our questions  We then left town for two months  When we recontacted Tomer he arrived a couple days later and spent several hours helping us clarify how we wanted the remodeled bathroom to look  He offered suggestions gently guided us away from a few bad decisions and offered resources

Work began within the week  We opted to select materials ourselves and were very pleased with the suppliers Tomer recommended  He told us that if we had the materials on hand as needed we managed to do so it would take no more than 6 weeks and that he would try for 4 weeks  It actually took 18 days from start to finish 

Each evening Tomer texted us the plan for the next day  Three Treeium crews did the work  All of them arrived when stated were careful of our possessions were tidy as the day progressed and cleaned up at the end of each day which was generally midafternoon  All 8 guys were pleasant skillful and efficient

This was a relatively small project but Tomer made us feel that we were his best  most important customer  We are very pleased with the quality of the work and with our relationship with Tomer

We found this a very positive experience and have couple more projects in mind with them"
5,I recently had some major work done with Treeium and it came out great We had very expensive sliding doors added to the back of our house after another contractor did a poor job Then the recent rains caused some balcony damage Gina and Greg were on the case a had a team resolve the problem for us My home is in excess of 5000000 and I felt comfortable using Treeium
5,Id like to thank the good people at Treeium especially Gina and Greg and all the people at the Quality Assistance Department that help me out with my leaky roof I had treeium come out two years ago to replace my whole roof 2 years later we had a leak even though were out of warranty for the labor they came out and patch the roof for no charge Gina was kind and courteous to help me with my problem and stayed in contact with me till the issue was resolved And Greg did everything he could to make things right And stayed on top of things till the leak was fixed I would recommend Treeium to anyone who needs any general construction done
5,Amir Teymouri of Treeium is very professional and hard working  He is doing a great job  The work looks great  Very efficient
5,I have had experience with one other 5 star company and all I can say is not all 5 star companies are the same on Home Advisor Treeium is a true 5 star companya class act a familylike company First it started with Liran who wrote in detail exactly what we would expect in remodeling our 1970s kitchen As with some companies we were not pressured Next came Natalie a first class interior designer who did a computer model of our new kitchen in detail She brought samples of cabinet finishes back splashes and paint to go with the countertops we had discussed with Liran During demolition the crew discovered the outside kitchen wall was soaking wet The wall board and insulation was removed and Liran was called When our new shower was turned on the water was running down the wall from a broken drain pipe that had been caused by another 5 star company when they replaced the upstairs shower and plumbing a few weeks before I cant imagine what the damage would have been if we had waited the 3 years to remodel the kitchen as originally planned Liran came right over to assess the situation and got the repairs done ASAP The rest of the remodeling came together with no problems and the end result was exactly what we wanted Unlike the other company who left as soon as the inspector signed the report Treeium paid attention to the finishing details All I had to do was text Liran with what I wanted done and it was taken care of to fixing spots on the ceiling to moving a drawer in one of the cabinets even the tiniest finishing details were taken care of I would not hesitate to recommend Treeium and make our kitchen available for viewing by potential customers
5,"I would like to express our gratitude of selecting Treeium as our contractor for our major remodel to our home in Laguna Beach CaBut more than this we were fortunate to have Farid Ghaheri as our general contractor Farids professionism attention to details knowledge of constructionlocal lawsvendors communicating and just plain getting the job done was superb  Amir was excellent as well Always available to us

Steve  Diane"
5,Weve been working with Ilya Nodel and he is a gem  We are doing an addition to our home and he is professional and friendly  He has been patient and also reassuring during the planning stages  He is always available to answer any questions we might have  Everything he has told us has been accurate we couldnt ask for better communication
5,I hired Treeium to come out and do a bath remodel  I ended up having them do all the flooring as well  Guy Breuer was the Project Manager  I liked that he always responded to my texts and questions promptly  He met with my schedule  Was friendly and cooperative with my needs
5,We are so pleased with our addition progress of a first floor master Treeium and Guy have be outstanding Guy has been an amazing communicator patient knowledgeable and caters to our needs He has been there from the planning to blueprints to permits and now almost done with the build
5,We could not be happier with our bathroom remodel Working with Maor Mike Tal the Project Manager was great He was always responsive and answered every question we had The Treeium construction crew was professional considerate of our time and my family and did high quality work We have already talked to Mike about future projects and highly recommend him and his crew
5,"I started out just getting quotes for refinishing kitchen cabinets then it became a complete kitchen remodel  After interviewing 3 other companies I went with Treeium  I connected with project managers Mike Tal right from the start  When you have strangers coming in and out of your home for 6 weeks you better like them and I did  Every worker who came in was great

  Thank you Mike "
4,"Treeium a good company

We recently had a bathroom remodel done in our 100 year home in Pasadena  We went through a selection process of four potential contractors and although Treeium was not the lowest price we liked their presentation best We were very pleased with our decision  Erez the project manager was excellent responsive easy to work with and he listened to what we wanted Treeiums work teams tiling Juan and plumbing Marcello in particular  were exceptional Also all the work crews were very neat and cleaned the area throughly each day The end result was a bathroom remodel better than we had hoped for and at the price we agreed to"
5,"Wow

If I am only allowed one word to describe our remodeling experience with Treeium it would be Wow 

Disclaimer  We are not the easiest clients to please and we do our due diligence extensively  My wife had prepared a page or 2 full of questions and interviewed 56 highly rankedhighly recommended contractors and ranked them based on points on a spreadsheet  Objectively at the end of this process Treeium came out on top  Subjectively we also chose Treeium as two of the people we know had remodeled recently with Treeium and both recommended this firm

Our project would be a pretty big project  We want to update our kitchen and remove two load bearing walls to make our living roomdining roomkitchen into one big open space  This meant opening   up the roof and put in two supporting beams  Build an island in the kitchen area  Switch the stove from one side of the kitchen to the other Get new appliances and cabinets  Seal off one of two fireplaces  Build tiled deco wall where the chimney were  Completely redo a downstairs bathroom that has been very dilapidated  Change a study room into a bedroom  Wall off part of the family and make it into a storage room   Move the entry door a few feet away to create a bigger laundry room  Change an existing storage room into a study room  Change the flooring on our master bedroom from carpet to tile  Change the hard wood floor to tile for nearly the entire house  Re pipe the old galvanized pipes to copper for water  Re pipe the old gas pipes  Termite treating the house  Painting the exterior of the house and most of the interior  Termite tenting of the whole house  Building new wrought iron side gates and fences  In short 95 of our house is being remodeled  

That being said my review will rate Treeium based on Timing delay Cost Quality and Customer Service

Timing
Right from the get go the project manager Lior came to our house and listened to what we wanted to do  He suggested that we meet with his designer to go over what we want and the designer came out with a design that really did accentuated everything we had wanted  The permitting process followed the architectural and engineering studies and everything went through without a hitch  Within a few weeks after signing the contract we were ready for the demolition process  

At the beginning of this process I had asked our project manager just how long this project would take  He told me that this project should be done in 2 months  I did not believe him when I first heard it because I know delays are usually to be expected in any remodeling project  Our previous remodeling done 10 years earlier with much smaller scope was completed in 4 months  So I was skeptical when I heard that this would be done in 2 months  The project ended up taking 25 months  The extra 2 weeks were actually not Treeiums fault instead it was due the conditions of the house once they opened the walls and some of the upgrades we wanted after the project had started  So I was quite amazed when the project ended up pretty much completed on time  

So wow

Cost
Treeium is not the low cost leader out of the many contractors we had interviewed  Treeium is not the most expensive either  Its quote falls on par with most of the quotes within a few percentage points  At the end we did not pick Treeium because of its price quote but purely based on how well it scored on our own ratings mentioned above and how highly recommended they were by their former clients

Quality of the workmanship
Wow  I dont exactly know much about construction so obviously I cant tell whether whatever Treeium did behind the walls plumbing wiring framing were great in quality  I can however tell that the finished product with the entertainment cabinets the kitchen cabinets the island the flooring painting and many more are very much high quality with definite attention to details The hardwares used are also top notch  

In my previous remodeling projects we had custom ordered cabinets from Home Depot  These cabinets from Treeium are exponentially better with soft closing on all of the doors   

The scope had included installation of recessed ceiling lights for several areas  Treeium did above and beyond that and replaced some of my older recessed lights to LED recessed lights  

In previous projects the contractors were capable in doing exactly what they needed to do  Treeium not only did what was in the scope on many occasions Treeium went above and beyond what were in the scope  And again everything Treeium did was done well

Customer Service

So far as you may tell I am truly impressed with Treeium  But what really earned my wow review is Treeiums approach to customer service  Right after the contracts are signed Lior the project manager starts to provide almost daily updates of where Treeium is in the process and what we need to do to get prepared such as packing and moving out  Once the project got started with the demolition the project manager would keep us apprised of everything thats going on in the house that day and provide us with a progress report and what to expect next  So we were kept in the loop every step of the way  

In addition obviously with a project this size some hiccups are to be expected such as damages caused by the demolitionremodeling  Those are unavoidable  Another reason Treeium and Lior earned the wow from me is how quickly they respond to our concerns and how well they addressed those concerns  At the end of the project we had prepared a punch list of all the items that needed to be fixed due to damages from this remodeling  Within a matter of days they were able to fix everything on the punch list often times to better conditions than they were before this remodeling project  No delays no excuses just get them done

Wow

We have moved back home for 5 days now and every moment I am here I look around and remember the way it was before this project I cant help but be amazed how quickly this whole project come together and how satisfied I am with the final result  

So wow  Kudos to Treeium and Kudos to Lior our project manager and thank you for a surprisingly pleasant experience"
5,"I had been wanting to fix my wooden floor which had been rotting away for the last 7 years due to moisture  So I was googling home improvement companies and had 2 companies to come n look at the rotting floor to see what they would say how they would go about figuring out the cause of the moisture etc None of the sales people impressed me enough so I didnt bother to get an estimate for cost Instead I googled for more companies n saw Treeium Their website n reviews sounded good enough so I had Treeium send me a salesman It turned out they actually dispatch project managers with experience Amir and Farid
They explained to me a thorough work processprocedure they would implement if I were to hire them  which seemed reasonable n professional Also it sounded very convenient for me because they had all different kinds of workersprofessionals who could diagnose n fix my floor 
A long story short I ended up hiring them n had them not only fix my floors but some electrical lines that had been giving us headaches as well It took over 3 weeks yet Im glad I had Amir n Farid take care of my house project They were prompt n quick to understand the work situation n most of all they knew how to be sensitive to even the smallest concerns I had No other companies I had worked with previously on other projects was able to meet such standard Im not an easy person to work withfor 
Also I really appreciated how they came to inspect the work morning n evening daily And I was actually impressed that they brought a portable toilet stand for the workers to use 
Overall I am fully satisfied with Treeium n the 2 project managers Amir and Farid I highly recommend this company"
5,Treeium did top quality work on our master bathroom remodel  Even the smallest detail that we werent satisfied with got resolved  Amir and Farid listened to what we had in mind and offered design suggestionsoptions that made our bathroom turn out beautiful  Tile shower and floor turned out great  We love the new vanity they suggested  A very high quality job
5,Jesse Marquez was very helpful in my initial phone call for estimate appt he seemed very knowledgeable kind and eager to help
5,Took longer than expected 4 months partly due to several inspections that changed the rules several times In the end Erez our Project Manager completed the job as promised Thank you Treeium
5,"Our experience with Avi Shushan has been excellent He kept us informed in every step of the process
Avi is very responsive and knowledgeable 
He is the most extreme personable and he made us feel very easy with everything
We will defiantly recommend him to everyone we know"
5,There are no words to describe the devotion and attention that we have received from Farid Ghaheri the project manager and his crew in the remodeling of our house  Farid is always available and unceasingly polite attentive and willing to offer suggestions that are always well thought out  His crew does superior work and we especially appreciated the work of Robert one of the foremen and Carlos one of the workers  The work was done promptly and on budget  There were no surprises and everything was up front  If you need any work done hire this company and ask for Farid 
5,Farid Ghaheri is our project manager and I couldnt be more satisfied He is a no pressure very easy personality He and his crew are very respectful of my home my dog and my family They are there when he says they will be and finish projects on time He is patient with me when I make changes He is totaly unflappable I have been very happy with the workmanship of the individual componants that make up my new master bath
5,Ive hired Treeium in the past and this is my 2nd 5star review for them I granted the 5 stars chiefly because of our Project Manager Avihen Levanon who efficiently coordinated the difficult task of a complete remodel of my 120yearold kitchen The entire kitchen except for the framework was demolished from the ceiling to the floor including an outside structure attached to the house which had covered up 2 of the original kitchen windows The kitchen required a lot of electrical upgrading and I appreciate that Treeium adheres to the strict building codes and my kitchen is in full compliance with the city I live in Another plus for Treeium are the different choices and fine quality of the cabinets countertops and flooring I was given to choose from My kitchen was built to my wishes I love it and what a delight having the windows restored Also it was completed in the time frame stated
5,"Update  We could not be happier with our new kitchen and the experience working with Treeium  Everyone at Treeium was extremely professional every step of the way  Those working on site and those in the office  Great craftsmanship excellent communication punctuality attention to detail  commitment to our satisfaction  We were picky and asked them to tend to small details we felt werent exactly right and they came right away and said they were committed to making us happy  We have worked with other companies during remodels and the experience has NOT always been positive like this  We highly recommend  Thank you Treeium


We are in the middle of a kitchen  bathroom remodel with Treeium right now and so far we couldnt be happier  

Our Project Manager Guy Borenstein made us feel like we are all part of the same passionate team on this remodel from the time we first met up until now  GHe is responsive makes himself available when we have questions or concerns  Hes been willing to take the time to walk us through all the steps of our project even if hes already explained it previously and he checks in to make sure were happy each step of the way  

The first plans we had for our kitchen turned out to be out of our budget not just with Treeium but with every company we got a bid from  Guy was able to work with us to suggest ways to cut down the budget and we arrived at a new plan that we are still extremely happy with and with a price we can afford  

We were told by friends family and even by Guy that going into a remodel can feel like your entire home has been turned into a dirty construction site but we have been very surprised and impressed to find that Treeium is very clean and professional throughout the entire process so far  They have used floor protection and sectioned off areas of our home from floor to ceiling while they are working which has kept nearly all of the dust out of the other rooms then what has surprised us the most is that when they leave in the afternoon they remove all plastic and floor protection so we feel completely at home and clean until the next morning when they lay down all the floor protection and section off areas with plastic again  We feel it really shows that theyre going the extra mile so we dont feel like were living in a construction zone  

All the actual work completed so far has been extremely high quality on time and on budget Everyone working in our home are polite and professional  Everyone has been willing to explain to us exactly what they are doing why how long it will take etc  

When the crew demod our old kitchen we found some issues in the walls that needed addressing  not treeiums fault  Treeium was able to rework the schedule to accommodate the new steps required to address those issues  

So far weve only had a single pice of wood that was cracked in the process of the remodel  They immediately offered to replace it  


So far 5 star rating for sure"
1,This remodel was the WORST experience ever  We have a very large bathroom and we were quoted 50K and told that it would take 8 weeks but it took over 8 mths  At the beginning of this project we felt so much pressure to buy a long list of things they needed so that the project wasnt delayed  How were we suppose to do that when all we had was a layout and no measurements Some of the delay with this project was due to the city inspector but ultimately their contractors were fixing errors or redoing things that werent done right  The first thing we were told is that a portion of a load bearing wall would need to be moved  They sent me the change order and said that it would cost 7000  The first thing I asked is what is the 7000 for  I was told not to worry that Id receive a detailed receipt  What they sent me was vague and didnt detail anything  I never shouldve signed that change order without the detailed breakdown in my hands first  So they used Simpson StrongTie hardware which is great but we told them that my husband and I work for Simpson and that we could provide the hardware that was needed  They claim they were never told this  I complained and was told that Treeium didnt buy any product from Simpson  This might be true if they already had the parts they needed but that doesnt mean that those costs didnt trickle down to us  Another thing that was added to the change order was replacement of the subfloor in the shower  We had already done the demo for the shower and it was clear when they saw the project that the subfloor would need to be replaced so to add this to the change order is ridiculous  They replaced clear block tile with a window in the shower but the window was too big thus half of it was in the shower and half out  They replaced the window but unfortunately the finish didnt match the other large window that they installed over the tub so they had to replace it yet again  We noticed the supply line for the toilet was about 10 away from the toilet so it was an eye sore  I asked them about it and they said That is what the inspector advised us to do and we cant change it   I called the inspector the next day and he said I dont have a change order but I have no problem if you want it moved   One concern before even starting the project was whether the exterior stuccopaint would match where they put in the windows  They told us that they paint the whole wall so theres no worry about a paint match  Well because that wasnt written in the contract they claim that they never told us that  The tub grout started to fail within the first week and we ended up with 6 extra boxes of floor tile  They did credit our bill for the extra floor tile  When I tried to use the tub the first time there was a problem with the water pressure  They ultimately fixed that but when I tried to use the shower the first time there was no cold water so it was scalding hot  Apparently there was a part in the valve that was broken or that they broke  A replacement part was bought and they still couldnt get it to work  The 2nd Project Mgr I was told the first one no longer worked there called me and told me it wasnt working and asked if he could go buy another shower valve similar to the one we bought  I said That is fine but we wont accept a cheap replacement  He assured me it would be good quality  I got home to find that they had to remove two of the tiles from the shower which I knew nothing about but the part they bought was a cheap 100 replacement and what we bought was almost 300 so we were not happy  They installed the plumbing for the vanity before the vanity even arrived which meant that the installation was difficult  According to the contractors doing the work they told us You guys bought the wrong size vanity  No one ever told us what size vanity to buy  The problem was that they put the plumbing in before they even knew what we purchased  They cut sloppy holes in the shelves of the vanity to accommodate the plumbing and have since fixed this by making new shelves but Ive lost most of my space on the bottom shelf  The silicone they put around the toilet came off after about 710 days and they grouted around the tub when that shouldve really been silicone  They ultimately did install silicone around the tub but they also put it in the shower  We never asked for silicone in the shower and it looks sloppy  They also countersunk the tub and that wasnt how it was designed to be installed  We had an existing pocket door that just needed a new latch on it which they installed but now its off track and scratching the paint on both sides  The only thing they are good at is reminding customers that a payment is due I would not recommend Treeium to my worst enemy
5,We found Treeium through Houzz Salesman and Project Manager Avi Shushan was at our house a couple of days later where he helped us put our remodel ideas together This was our first remodel and we were not sure what to expect We had heard that contractors worked sporadically  but the Treeium experience was continuous Avi always gave us a heads up on the schedule  We had pleasant skilled crews working on our home every day for a month Avi also has a helpful designers eye if you are doing your own design work and need a nudge The stamped concrete guys are artists as are the tile and paint guys The results are gorgeous
5,Guy gave us a bid we could live with  The contract was clear and through the whole project was exactly as the contract stated  Payments were easy to make online  Guy was easy to work with and listened  The work was done on time  Antonio cleaned up every night  Could not be happier with my new kitchen  Best construction experience ever
5,"Thank you Lior Lazarovich for a very professional job well done 
  Lior was always available to us too answer all our requests and questions  Great job Lior we wish you the best"
5,Treeium and my project manager Guy Breuer really delivered on my bathroom remodel  They were the 3rd quote I received and I found the fairest of all  The project came in within scope on time actually a little ahead of schedule and on budget  Dont forget to include them in your project plan
5,"We met with Erez to discuss our bathroom remodel project He was very personable knowledgeable and professional After interviewing other companies we decided to go with Treeium and were very glad we did
Erez and his crew did a great job The bathroom looks awesome The work was completed on time and the workmanship was top notch
Would definitely recommend to our family and friends"
5,"Farid is spectacular
He exceeded my expectations
He is professional artistic punctual dependable timely and realistic
He treats small projects with same respect and professionalism as a big project
I know because we started off a tiny project but expanded it and are still so very thrilled
I highly recommend him We are already planning phase 2"
5,Were in the process of doing a room addition to our new house and recently signed with Treeium Farid Ghaheri is managing the project and we cant praise him highly enough From the very first meeting hes been professional articulate and punctual  most of the time hes early very important to us with our tight schedules Farid walked us through the entire process and timeline and was always honest and realistic with his recommendations and estimates Treeium in general has been wonderful to work with for several reasons 1 their userfriendly and transparent online portal 2 set cost 3 versatility with adding to the scope of work 4 their economy of scale with several crews and professionals available to do whatever needs to be done when it needs to be done We discussed budget with Farid very early on and by the time we got to the contract and detailed scope of work the price he gave us was right in the initial range he quoted us One of the best things about how Farid works is that he always has examples of recent or ongoing projects to illustrate his ideas hes a wizard with his iPhone and laptop Farid is extremely responsive to texts emails and calls and always impresses us with how frequently hes available to swing by our home to discuss an idea or to check on someones work Youre in good hands with Treeium and especially with Farid
5,Thank you for the initial information on how you work  The video is also helpful I look forward to getting a proposal
5,So far the kitchen is looking goodDaniel is very positive friendly and personable We would recommend Treeium to others they have a great quality assurance representative Darrell
5,"Spoke with Nina who was very helpful and professional in answering a few of my questions and making me feel that working with Treeium could be a good fit for us 
I look forward to our initial appointment next week to find out more Thank you Nina"
5,Lisa was very pleasant to speak to She was my first exposure to Treeium and gave me enough confidence in the company that I setup the initial appointment
4,Treeium and Itay the Project Manager were very good  They came on time fallowed all of my directions came back promptly if I thought something else needed to be done and completed the project within a decent period of time  I would recommend them for bathroom remodels  The cost was reasonable for the job done
5,We needed to remodel our 2 bedroom condo in Culver City and needed it done quickly because we were paying for two mortgages at the same time Erez Shifferman came and after chatting for a few minutes with my wife and me he immediately understood our ideas and concerns and provided many helpful suggestions on how to save time and money with our project Not only is he knowledgeable about all aspects of remodeling but is also honest and upfront with all the costs Some contractors might give you a low estimate at the beginning and surprise you with extra charges down the road but this is never the case with Erez and Treeium because they are such a reputable and old company and they have an ironclad reputation to defend
5,"Amazing company to work with
The crew is honest reliable and professional

The are prompt and always available if you need them

I highly recommend Treeium"
5,the workmanship is excellent  all of the men were on the job on time finished job in a timely manneras promised  house looks great  so good i have just hired treeium to do another job for me bigger than first  i trust them to care for my home as i do  farid the project manager has integrity  he looks out for me and my home as if it were his own  he arrives for appointments when he says he will  i couldnt be happier with the whole experience i will use them again and again  thank you treeium team
5,"I ordered a 308sqft aluminum patio cover to reduce the sun exposure on my back bedroom Not only does the cover look great but how things progressed was impressive 
1 I was given an up front price that was in line with competitors I chose them due to other good reviews they have had
2 The project was timed and well managed by Erez who coordinated the permit the materials purchase and the installation 
3 The installation passed inspection the first time and was well done Built per plan 

Overall this was was a very pleasant and efficient engagement of an impeccable business I highly recommend Treeium"
5,We just started working with Treeium in the preliminary phase and so far so good They are extremely professional and timely My husband and I just started the process and in the meantime we won a 200 Amazon gift card by completing a survey for them We were so excited Adriana Villasenor and Don Mkhitarian hand delivered the gift card to our home and were super sweet and helpful Its safe to say we are looking forward to working with them and our project manager Don Mkhitarian
5,Sam Deen and his crew did an excellent job in remodeling our master bathroom  Everyone was very courteous on time cleaned the site daily and respected our work days and hours  They made my dream bathroom come true
5,We recently had a bathroom remodel done by Treeium and were very happy with their work and especially with our project manager Farid  Their workers showed up on time worked diligently on the project and cleaned up each day when they were done  Farid was on site every day to make certain the work was progressing and he was also a huge help with the design details and in making sure everything was done to our liking  The job was completed professionally and on time and looks great  We would definitely give 5 stars to Farid and Treeium
5,"Always a scary proposition trusting in a constructionremodeling company but we really lucked out with Treeium Initially contacted by Guy Breuer who was to be the project manager on our master bath remodel He gave us a quote that was far less than 2 other contractors and promised the work would be completed in 4 weeks He lied It was done in just under 3 weeks 
Guy was very helpful in recommending tile and bathroom fixture companies in the area and we found exactly what we were looking for thanks Russ at Modello Tile What I really think made all the difference was the crew that we had for our project Shout out to Miguel Liverado and the rest of Juans crew true craftsmen Clean efficient and showed up every day until completion
Truly an amazing and easy experience I strongly suggest at least making Treeium one of your quotes"
5,Ashley was very professional reviewing my remodeling needs and scheduling a project estimator to meet with me  Selection will be based on proposal
5,The Irvine team headed by Farid are so professional I appreciate all the workers from the demo team to the tile men to the plumbers They are polite personable receptive to questions and input clean up when they are done and very good at what they do You will not regret hiring this team Kara
5,Tomer is remarkably reliable and responsive  He conducted himself and subcontractors in an effiicent and professional manner   We will be using Treeium and Tomer again soon
5,"After interviewing several contractors for a kitchen remodel we awarded the contract to Treeium and I am glad we did

From the onset they were professional clean neat reliable and the end result is an amazing kitchen that we love

Our Project manager was Assaf Labi  He and his team of experts came in measured drew and gave us a quote  From start to finish Assaf coordinated everything  We talked to him on a daily basis  He texted to make sure all was clean when the crew left for the evening

I was amazed that even during the demolition phase there was no dust in adjoining rooms  They had the place sealed tight

The quality of our cabinets is outstanding and the workmanship for installation if perfect Their designer came up with different ideas  We kept making changes until we were happy  She knew her stuff

I highly recommend Treeium for any remodel you want to do  They are a reliable company  With all the nightmares you hear about contractors we did not experience any problems"
5,I first met Guy Borenstein and then he became like a brother figure  He came inspected gave an estimate brought the crew and did the job on time and as per their estimate  I definitely recommend him and Treeium for any renovation or upgrade you need around your house
5,"When I decided to remodelenlarge my bathroom and build new closets I wasnt sure Id find someone who can build exactly what I wanted especially since we had to deal with HOA rules and CCRs 
Erez Schifferman ruled over the job and dealt with all the hiccups that always happen when remodeling and construction is done in a very professional and friendly way Im not sure I wouldve survived this without him being on top of all of it Oh and Im quite surprised that he survived my complaining during the last 3 months"
5,Im so over joyed with the experience we have had with Erez Schifferman  He hasnt represented this company with outstanding professionalism patience and motivation  We had a terrible experience with a different company so we were very nervous about dealing with contractors once again but Erez has made sure that all our questions have been answered and had reassured through the project  Were almost done with our project and are overly pleased
5,We had our front and backyard re landscaped with drought tolerant plants and materials Erez Shifferman was responsive to every request we had to make our yard perfect When there were questions problems  as there are with all construction projects  Erez was available immediately  and addressed every one in a timely and in a more than satisfactory manner I would recommend Erez Shifferman and Treeium for any and all of your home remodel needs
5,We hired Treeium to remodel our master bathroom Guy Borenstein was very easy to work with and followed through with us every step of the way The crews were professional did good work were friendly and always cleaned up after each job Our remodel was done in a timely manner and we are very pleased
5,So far Treeium and our head contractor Guy Borenstein have done an amazing job on our open concept kitchen remodel And we are not easy customers We had load bearing walls removed beams placed within the ceiling concrete footings poured under the house our hardwood floors seamlessly matched to run from the living room into the kitchen drywall on the walls and ceiling is perfectly flat and all has gone smoothly Meanwhile we are still living in the house so they sealed off the rest of the house with zipper entry doorways and the dreaded dust that we were so afraid of has been kept to a minimum They are even sticking to their budget and timeline Ive been warned these days that is not to be expected We should know because we have experienced the worst with other contractors  So I feel the need to shout off the mountain tops how awesome these guys are We cant wait to see the finished product
5,We just had our house remodel completed by Treeium and we couldnt be happier  We started with the kitchen demolition which honestly made my wife cry  But the kitchen that was built in its place is like a dream come true  Our Project Manager Lior Lazarovich took our old tired kitchen and gave us a new house  I cant believe this is the same house we lived in for 7 years  Im truly blown away by the quality of their work  5 Stars all the way  Thanks again Lior Lazarovich and Treeium
5,One of the greatest experiences I has while remodeling my home Great company great customer service and workmanship I was very impressed by the professionalism of my project manager he managed my project which was a gate replacement and a kitchen remodel in a very timely matter Im very happy with my decision and would highly recommend this company to my friends
5,There were some problems and delays  However they promised to complete all punch list items by December 11 2017  It is extremely satisfying to receive clear commitments from Treeium
4,"I dont think any contractor is perfect and deserves 5 stars since there is always room for improvement  But we are very happy with Treeiums work and the results of our project

We completed our house remodel with Treeium in April 2017  It was an extensive project requiring us to move out of the house for 8 months  We added a bathroom shifted the location of our kitchen completely rebuilt an old addition with new vaulted ceilings upgraded all the electrical new HVAC and tankless water heater

We found Treeium on Home Advisor and selected them for these reasons
1  They are a local company which made communicationmeetings very easy
2  We liked the idea that they did not sub out their workers  The same foreman Mika and his crew of 56 guys were here throughout the entire project with additional specialty contractors such as electrical tile layer HVAC installer
3  The salesperson Guy Borenstein was very goodnatured and we thought he would be an easy person to work with  Turned out to be true
4  They could also take care of the engineering plans and we would not have to hire a separate engineerarchitect
5  They state that the customer will not incur additional costs above the initial bid for contractor mistakes or misjudgments  This was absolutely true

While I dont think that any construction projects are perfect and without stress we were generally pleased with Treeium for their work ethic and attention to customer expectation  They were very efficient during the work schedule and we were consistently updated with the progress  Any mistakeserrors which are inevitable were quickly taken care of  We are truly enjoying our newly remodeled home and have referred Treeium to several of our friends interested in remodeling their homes

Our biggest complaints would be the following 1 they were sometimes insensitive to our schedules asking us to immediately run out and purchase items needed for the house 2 the communication between various workerscrew was sometimes lacking 3 more time and attention could have been paid to drywall finishing and 4 the crew could have done a better job maintaining our existing landscape we are still digging concrete pieces and construction debris out of our lawns  Fairly small issues considering the scope of our project

Overall I would recommend Treeium for your house project  Compared to the nightmare stories I have heard about other contractors Treeium is a reliable company and genuinely tries their best for the customer"
5,"FANTASTIC AND FOLLOW UP  I highly recommend Treeium
We used Treeium to renovate our kitchen  I got bids from 6 different companies and Treeium was neither the least nor the most expensive  But Ron was able to show photos of previous work and also seemed the most sincere  We needed to have the kitchen finished in 5 weeks as we wanted it done before we moved into the house  Ron and his team finished the job on time and within the budget  
Theyve come over several times to make the smallest of adjustments for me  As a matter of fact 4 months after the job the kitchen faucet was loose and Ron sent someone to fix it and at no charge
We plan on renovating our baths soon and Ron and Treeium will be the first team we call"
5,We had an entire house remodeled and worked with PG Mr Ron Amondy and Mr Allan Nagar They and their crews were professional punctual and responsible the whole time The quote was also closed to the actual cost at the end We were happy  and satisfied with their service and will highly recommend them to anyone who need a remodel service
5,"Assaf was my project manager He did an outstanding job My kitchen and bathroom were totally gutted and remodeled He is experienced knowledgeable supportive and well organized He kept constant communication with me throughout the construction process which I appreciated Assaf provided me with guidance when it was time to choose appliances sinks flooring countertops etc 

I have a high end kitchen now that functions to meet my needs My bathroom looks elegant What a difference
Yvonne"
5,"We had a master bathroom redone Eli was tremendous as both a person and as a project manager The work was all excellent and the process smooth All details were thoroughly discussed and changes requested along the way were accommodated graciously
All of the workers were pleasant and courteous Definitely a recommendation from us"
5,"Yay Im finally done with my project and I want to extend my sincere gratitude to Erez Shifferman  Treeium Erez you brought trust back to my realm of working with contractors thank you so much for everything youve done for me I interviewed Erez as a part of cautiously trying to commit to executing a general remodel that I was thinking of for a long time and I immediately connected with him I knew right then and there that I would work well with him because you definitely want to feel comfortable and communicate well with the person who is going to be in charge of your once in a life time remodeling project In my opinion this is true to any scale project not necessarily an involved and longer one 
Erez was able to show me his company profile all of their contractors licenses and paperwork This put my mind at ease and I decided to go with Treeium Now when the project is completed  Im happy to say that the quality of the workmanship and attention to detail blow me away I am very pleased with all of the work done Erez was always available by text or phone call and he spent a lot of time helping me make decisions and going over options I never felt rushed or that my needs were not met
The entire process went smoothly despite the fact that my daughter and I lived in the home the entire time I even have two inside dogs and they always made sure to keep their water bowl full and put them outside and clean up when needed Every room was transformed beautifully It looks like a new home Actually the project took longer than expected because I ended up adding more and more to the original scope of work after I saw how smooth worry free and well handled the process has been I figured I might as well get it all done and finish my dream list Communication was key for me throughout the process and Erez masters that very well regardless to what time the clock reads Bottom line I was very well served with nothing but professionalism great quality of workmanship communication  and honesty Thank you again Erez  Treeium for a very well done job I highly recommend Treeium and Erez for your home and all of your contracting needs You wont be disappointed"
5,Treeium demolished our combination bathtubshower in order to install a walkin shower with a sliding door to accommodate my 84yearold father who moved in with us The shower is aesthetically very attractive and works well to meet my Dads needs The workmen were courteous and the project manager Erez was on top of the project and communicated well with us every step of the way
5,Treeium remodeled our kitchen and it came out beautifully We found Treeium through Home Advisor I wanted to remodel the old kitchen we had because I continuously kept getting splinters So we remodeled with Treeium and our kitchen is simply amazing Very impressed with the precision of the cabs  countertops They made sure everything is sealed If Treeium would make a mistake they graciously corrected the concern Very professional hard working company Communication could have been better between labor workers Overall the experience was great Benjamin was the best project manager He kept in touch with us and addressed all of our concerns Very punctual and communication with him was great I definitely will consider working with Benjamin  Treeium again
5,One word   Excellent  The renovation was completed with ease AND ahead of schedule  The cost was relative to the renovation  The project manager Liran Avital was extremely valuable  He was at my disposal at any hour including but not limited to 1130 pm when I could respond to various forms of communication  Mr Avital took very good care of my investment  His foreman Caesar and his crew were extremely tidy diligent meticulous and patient in every aspect of the renovation  If Caesar had a question about the design he asked and fully understood sometimes vague instructions  The designer Natalie did a fabulous job on suggesting the appropriate backsplash cabinetry and appropriate handles  The kitchen cabinets are selfclosing with a spice rack and lazy Susan contained therein  Treeium was an excellent choice
5,Treeium provided us with excellent tasteful kitchen and bathroom remodelIng within our budget  Our condo is now stylish and ready for rental  Prior to contacting Treeium we had gone through the estimation process with two big box companies which we decided not to use because of their outofa can offerings and dishonest estimation practices  From telephone reception to oversight to the finishing touches Treeium was professional expeditious and friendly in their dealings  Project Manager Guy Breuer warmly walked us through the entire process explaining what sorts of things might be discovered that would affect the scope of work and therefore cost  He and his team of excellent contractors not only carried out the work but also made important aesthetic suggestions based on their experience  We are very happy we went with them and would not hesitate to contact Treeium again for any remodeling work
5,My experience with Treeium was great My project manager was Lior Lazarovich and he was great  I will most likely choose Treeium for future renovations I have no complaints for Lior He did an amazing job assisting my needs and addressed all my concerns
4,My name is Ben I had my sons fiancés kitchen remodeled and I have to say everything went ok I had to leave town for a weekend and project manager Lior was amazing at managing their renovation I had left specific instructions to install a delicate vintage style stove to their kitchen as a wedding gift Everything went great And theyre very happy and satisfied with the remodel
5,Treeium and Erez Shifferman our project manager were amazing Weve suffered through way too many hot summers in our own home until we just couldnt take it anymore We met with several companies in the process of trying to wrap our heads around costs and different solutions for our needs Erez stood out from the crowd right from the getgo with professionalism communication honesty and overall good vibe We were very impressed with his expertise knowledge and how he carried himself overall Erez kept in touch with us after our initial meeting and made us feel very comfortable towards the next meeting we lined up with him to go over specifics of the project and get everything going Erez delivered everything he promised and I simply cant believe how smooth our project was handled considering all the elements of the project which included removal of a giant 50ft tall tree reinsulating our attic including 2 attic exhaust fans repainting our entire house installing brand new AC units in all the bedrooms and the cherry on the icing  3500sf of beautiful energy efficient drought tolerant landscaping that completely transformed our front and back yards from desert like no mans land to beautifully designed yards were now proud of We want to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to Erez were truly blown away by the service and attention we received from him we simply cant imagine the process being any smoother or worries free than what it was Now that the project is completed were happy to contribute our review to the list of reviews Erez is so proud of we now know he works very hard towards making his customers happy and satisfied so the least we can do is share our story with others  if youre reading this review and thinking to work with Treeium do yourself a favor and ask to meet with Erez hes a needle in a haystack
5,We remodeled a second bathroom  Complete gut job changing bathtub to shower removing a soffit  The project manager was Lior who was excellent at communicating with us as the project progressed  We are very happy with the result
5,"Erez Shifferman was our project coordinator We moved out of state while the work was being done Erez was great and very easy to work with remotely  he kept in touch regularly also often sending photos of progress He handled purchasing of items so that we didnt have to worry about that He gave us confidence that Treeium was doing good work while we were many miles away and made it a stressfree experience for us

After the work was done we made a quick trip back to see it inperson We were very satisfied with the overall quality of work by Treeium"
5,"When great work is combined with exceptional service the results is always fun

The project is almost completed A few minor changes need to be done However Treeium did an excellent job Took their time to bring the most out of the work and made adjustments as 

Based on the overall craftsmanship and the quality of each character Gustavo cab installer Roy electrician Jaime the painter and Phillip the tile man need a raise 

It is a pleasant home owner experience Strongly recommend Treeium to do your remodel They stand as a professional contractor because it is critical for increasing the value of your home The RIGHT way

Have a great day

Victor Lesley"
5,The last thing that you want to be told when you move into your new home is that you have mold and that they will need to test isolate rip out and reconstruct the affected area When that reality set in within a week or so after we had moved in we were heartbroken While it hurt we knew that we needed to take care of the issue immediately When we hired Treeium to perform the work we were very impressed by Farids knowledge and experience His explanation of the situation and what steps were needed to remediate were thorough and complete Farid maintained proper communication throughout the entire project and the Treeium staff who performed the work were incredibly professional and skilled We thank Treeium for making our home safe and healthy
5,"I had Treeium remove my old HVAC and replace it with a new one My project manager was Tomer Turjeman He was truly fantastic to work with He was very helpful in helping decide on the best approach for the install and was very diligent in following up with the details On top of that he was a great conversationalist and was very respectful and friendly with my mother who is staying with me for a bit She was at the house during the project and really enjoyed talking with Tomer She commented many times on how great Tomer and the rest of the Treeium team were Tomer is the primary reason for my 5star rating

The work was completed with high quality and the new HVAC works very well This is the first summer at the house where we were able to keep it consistently cool Were very pleased with it My only point of critical feedback is that Treeium is on the higher end pricingwise and I would have liked to see a more transparent breakdown of the job costs  I did not decrease my rating for this however because it was ultimately my decision to move forward and the job came in exactly at the agreed upon cost

Excellent work Tomer and team Were very pleased"
5,"I had the pleasure of dealing with Guy Borenstein in working on a
proposal that fit my budget and he did everything he possibly could to meet that criteria and I was satisfied with the final proposal He is so honest and real and I truly appreciated that Unfortunately for Treeium I decided to sell my condo as is I love trees and I love the fact the Treeium plants a tree at the completion of each renovation Wish I could have been part of that I highly recommend Guy Borenstein in particular at Treeium and their spectacular work as youll see on their website I could not have had a more pleasant experience"
5,After several difficult attempts with other contractors for our kitchen remodel we finally landed on Treeium and the fantastic Project Manager Oshrat She was very attentive honest and responsive She addressed every question or concern I had along the way and completed to job in a timely manner The project was only a partial kitchen remodel new quartz counters marble backsplash new sink and faucet but we were always treated us like a bigticket customer We went into the project with a firm budget and only had one surprise with some electrical work that needed to be done Oshrat was always mindful of our budget and even with the extra expense we still ended up under budget Allen and Marvin did a lot of the work for our project and did a great job I tend to be a perfectionist and notice all the little things Every time I pointed something out they were always quick to fix it Even a few weeks after the project was completed I found a few small things that were not to my liking I texted Oshrat and she was ontop of it and said they would fix anything that was not to my liking I would recommend Treeium in a heartbeat
5,"I have partnered with Treeium to acquire more clients with larger design projects

5,"Treeium was amazing I was referred to them by a close friend that did a bunch of work on her place after a major water leak She loved them and said they are very fast have fair prices and are easy to communicate with

I had a water leak in my tentants unit I explained to them that my tenants wanted to get back in their home ASAP They were constantly doing whatever they could to make things go faster They said my project would be completed in about 8 days or so They finished it in about 5 instead Everything looks great They went the extra mile and helped us find the best matching materials they were easy to communicate with and answered every text and call within minutes That is definitely not the case with most contractors They underpromised and overdelivered on everything Erez The Project Manager was amazing He is very personable went out of his way to help in any way he could After this project I honestly feel like I have a new personal friend I would not hesitate to hire them again"
5,Liran Avital and the Treeium crew completed a full kitchen and bathroom remodel for us and we are thrilled with the results We have had some nightmarish experiences in the past so we were reluctant to take this project After contacting Treeium  and meeting with Liran in person he gave us all the confidence we needed we interviewed 2 other companies before and after we met Liran and let me tell you this no one were even close to the professionalism and the well established reputation Treeium have and the way Liran went through every aspect of the project with us so we decided to move forward with Treeium and so glad we did From the start Liran patiently worked with us to draw up the plans scope of work budget and timeline His expertise and suggestions made all the difference in ensuring we made the most out of the space we have Liran was on site overseeing his crew for flawless execution He lent his expertise in helping me select final touches like drawer pulls kitchen faucets and lighting and bathroom layout and design The crew was very  polite nice and clean throughout the whole time of the remodeling Every day I received emails or phone calls updating me what was happening who was coming and going when payments were due etc I felt completely looped in and reassured at the overall coordination of all the people involved everything Liran had promised he delivered This is a top notch company and Liran was a fantastic project manager and was very easy to work with  The project was completed on time Liran is honest detail oriented and very professional Thank you Liran and the Treeium crew for my new kitchen and bathroom It was a pleasure to work with you We highly recommend Liran Avital  and Treeium crew for smooth peaceful remodeling process and quality work for everyone who is thinking to remodel his house
5,I hired Treeium for my remodeling project and couldnt be happier with my decision I had a wonderful experience with the company and my project manager Guy Borestein He was always available for me throughout the entire process He gave us an excellent customer service Out project turned out great Once again thank you Treeium for a job well done
1,"We worked with Guy who is very personable but the job that needed to be done took well over the time we were told  I understand that there are complications when doing a complex design but the communication was horrible and took well over 6 months   

We were very clear in our expectations and when it came to the build we didnt actually hire Treeium  Their bid was more than 100K over what we were bid by other companies  They tried to work with us and give us discounts but in the end we went with another contractor  

This is where things were very frustrating  We were told the plans would be complete and ready to build  There were issues with the plans that the contractor had to modify simple measurements and walls where there couldnt be  These small issues my contractor was able to work with the inspectors but the biggest issue was the retaining walls below our build  They didnt put them where needed nor tall enough and when we called them back to fix the problem we were billed almost 1000 to fix  We are still fighting them to not pay for this bill  Instead of responding to us and fixing the problem they say we should expect changes    I can see if we changed the plans   but this was a blatant mistake by the engineer and we should NOT be billed because they did the plans wrong in the first place  DISAPPOINTING to say the least  "
5,Up to this point am very happy with the work performedErez was there answering my questions and concernsthank you
5,Ive known Erez Shifferman for years now but Ive never had the need to work with him professionally for any of the construction services he offers When I learned Erez offers energy efficient upgrades as an energy upgrade California contractor and after discussing some ideas I felt very comfortable with letting Erez perform the upgrades to my home Needless to say Erez made the experience flawless and super smooth even when I was out of state for the majority part of the work Erez is one of those people you immediately feel like you can trust as hes a straight shooter professional personable and honest My energy efficient upgrades are making a huge difference to my home and Im very content with the work performed Thank you Erez for making this happen for me and Im happy we could do business together

5,"Excellent job was done by Treeium  their crew After looking around for over 3 months for a good contractor I was finally referred to Treeium Their project manager was friendly knowledgeable professional and most of all honest Absolutely no pressure tactics which made me feel comfortable with him We decided to go with them to remodel our kitchen  do some landscaping in the backyard They installed artificial turf and waterconversant plants and now my backyard looks beautiful My kitchen was really old needed everything updated They gave me new cabinets countertops tile and lighting It literally looks like a new house and my friends are always astonished when they come over

5,I was refereed to Treeium by a friend of mine because he had heard the horror stories Ive had with other contractors in the past He told me they were professional reliable and high qualityand wow he was right Best remodeling experience Ive ever had We did a complete new roof for our home and it came out beautiful All the workers were very friendly and I was constantly kept updated as the project was progressing I strongly recommend Treeium and will for sure be using them again
4,After waiting approximately 12 to 13 years to make a decision to semiremodel our 1947 kitchen we found ourselves hunting for the right company to perform high quality work for us in a timely fashion We interviewed approximately 6 to 7 companies and we decided to award the contract Treeuim to do the work  Our project manager is Guy Bornstein and I cant say enough about his enthusiasm and professionalism He represents his company well and while we are in week two of our remodel so far most everything is going well and I cant wait to update our friends  family when everything is finished
5,Guy Borenstein is the guy you want leading your project I cant say enough about him and his crew An absolute professional Everything was done within the time frame he gave us and was done with the highest standards My new kitchen looks amazing His crew was very nice polite and worked so hard to get the job done Guy was always in contact with updates on the remodel and there at anytime to answer any questions I had His ideas really made a difference in the way the kitchen came together His knowledge and vision made working with him so easy The kitchen is now the place where we spend all our time Couldnt be happier We plan on doing more work to the house later and I wouldnt call anyone else
5,Treeium Inc was hired to replace my problematic flat roof and the job was very well done We passed both inspections first strike and overall were very satisfied So much can be said about a roof job other than it looks good but definitely plenty can be said about the project manager behind the scene who made it all happen Erez Shifferman Ive been around for a while to know that Erez is a rarity in the construction industry His integrity communication skills and attention to details are something to take pride in and his company should know about it Erez brings to the table everything he promises and it is obvious he cares about what he does how he does it and who he does it for Im not sure how many project managers Treeium employes but if half of them are carved from the same material Erez is carved it is crystal clear to me how Treeium was able to be featured in magazines such Inc 500 and Forbes Its all about the individuals behind the scene All the power to you guys
5,I was looking to have my windows and slider door replaced I interviewed a few different companies and then met with Treeiums representatives Rose Chang and Neev Kugel They were very professional from start to finish My biggest challenge was finances and Rose and Neev were able to assist me by setting me up with the HERO program They were extremely honest and explained everything to me before we proceeded forward with our agreement Throughout the whole process they kept me updated regarding everything that was happening and about to happen They were onsite to supervise and keep the project on schedule I was so pleased with the service that I decided to have them do my exterior paint of the house It was overall a wonderful experience and I would strongly recommend Rose and Neev and the Treeium team for anyone considering with a quality company Thank you Rose and Neev
5,"We hired Treeium for partial renovation of our house which included remodeling of the bathrooms replacement carpet with hardwood floor and porcelain tiles painting walls ceiling windows inside and outside doors and some cabinets and replacement and installation of new fans lights switches circuits plumbing and airconditioner duct covers One of the challenges was that we did not move our furniture and boxed staff out of the house and the team kept moving all those around and disassembled and reassembled furniture as it was necessary We even managed to stay at home for the first twothree weeks of the renovation In agreement with Treeium we chose the option to select and buy vanities airjet bath tub faucets and such materials as floor wood and tiles by ourselves Shower glassdoors LED lights and miscellaneous parts and materials were provided by Treeium 
Project manager Lior Lazarovich leaded the team very professionally friendly and flexible He tried to satisfy all our requests He was in touch with us on a daily basis or more often when it was necessary  In his messages he updated us every evening Seeing the high quality of the team work we asked to add to the project some extra work that we initially did not considered  Lior explained all our possibilities and helped make the proper choices  We have never experienced any push from him  Despite of the additional work the project was completed in time The team worked on Saturdays and sometimes on Sundays We also thank Carlos Escrobar for high quality and optimal solutions  Thank you guys very much
Halfyear later we are still very satisfied with the work done by Treeium  All neighbors friends and other visitors to our house who had seen the house before the renovation are usually impressed and comments positively Some told us that we are lucky to find such a company All renovated entities still look nice and work properly The only necessary replacement was a malfunctioned LED light which Treeium quickly replaced without any charges after my single call to Lior  We want to thank Lior again for his fine work and customer oriented attitude and Treeium management for organizing such a good company"
5,We hired Treeium for whole house renovation We just bought this old condo and nothing had been updated at least 15 years Our project manager was MIKE he is very responsible whatever or whenever we needed to talk to him he responded quickly Even a little problem he took care of it immediately And his team theyre all awesome They work hard and make sure everything works and looks great I honestly some of other contractors might do their work cheaper but comes to the quality of work cant beat Treeium Now our condo came back to life and looks like a new one Thanks to MIKE and his team
5,Treeium provided  installed beautiful energy efficient windows and a sliding door in our home and we couldnt be happier over all  Erez Shifferman who worked with us as the manager for the project is an honest professional and extremely easy to work  communicate with The service he gave us was superb and we cant imagine being treated any better I already have a few family members lined up to check out my beautiful new windows and sliding door so we hope to refer more business to Erez and Treeium in the near future
5,"I hired Treeium Inc to take care of my leaky deck and planters after having water damage due to bad original design and construction of the deckplanters The project manager who met with me and later on was responsible for my project was Erez Shifferman As opposed to another company that offered a partial fix to remedy the problem Erez suggested a different approach of redoing the deck entirely to make sure were not just masking the problem but actually taking care of it from the root Although the price point was higher than the other company for the obvious reason that the solutionscope of work suggested by Erez was much more involved I felt that this would optimally be the better approach for my piece of mind Overall and throughout the project Erez kept me involved on a daily basis with pictures and updates and made me feel at ease that I was being taken care of Erez made sure to keep superb fluent communication with me and I can honestly say that my experience with Treeium as a company and Erez as the project manager who ran my project was flawless smooth and stress free It was very noticeable that Erez genuinely went the extra mile for me and you can tell hes just that type of a professional person who would do the same for all of his clients I was really impressed as well with their headquarters office and operation when I came in to sign the paperwork you can definitely tell that theyre a top notch company that takes great pride in their customer service and quality of work No more working with shady companies that operate from PO boxes
I am 100 satisfied with the service and quality of workmanship I was provided with and would definitely recommend Erez  Treeium to whoever I know who might be in need of any construction service Thanks guys"
5,I hired Treeium Inc for my much needed energy efficient upgrades around the house which included a complete replacement of my roof and windows The project manager who worked with me was Erez Shifferman a true professional easy going friendly and caring person whom I knew was going to take care of me and my project from the first time we sat by the table Sure enough I was right My project was ran seamlessly smoothly and with no glitches whatsoever which is a rarity in the construction world I can already tell how much of an impact my new roof and windows are having on the temperature and comfort inside my home Thank you Erez for delivering everything you promised I will be more than happy to refer you to anyone I know who might be able to benefit from your outstanding service
5,Treeium to the rescue  I had the BEST Project Manager Lior Lazarovich  He was patient kind and very quick to respond to my calls  Lior and his crew came in to start My Complete Kitchen Remodel on January 9th  Along with the Kitchen remodel on January 11th Treeium replaced Two Sliding Glass Doors and Three Windows  All these guys were no nonsense take care of business workers  Everything was done fast clean  efficient I was simply amazed at how everything was planned out like clock work Boom Boom Boom  The organization that Lior maintained with his crew and keeping my sanity in check throughout all this activity was BRILLIANT  My finished project was realized on February 8th My dream has come true  I would definitely call Treeium again for another project without hesitation
5,"We were looking to have a Solar system installed on our home as our electric bills started to escalate drastically over the years We interviewed a few companies to have this project done including Treeium Treeium sent out their Solar Specialist Mr Neev Kugel to assess our needs and discuss the effects and benefits of going Solar Upon meeting Neev we felt very comfortable with him and immediately noticed that he was far more knowledgeable regarding Solar than any other representative we had met before He explained everything to us he let us know ahead of time that we will need to upgrade our main electrical panel as a part of the Solar installation something that no other representative had mentioned before and he told us exactly what we should expect throughout each stage of this project 
Later on we were even more satisfied and confident in our decision of choosing Treeium and Neev as they found out that we had an open permit with our county for a patio project we took on in the past The permit was never finalized and had we not met Neev on time we would have paid a heavy fee to the county for not dealing with this properly 
Neev assisted us with taking care of this he took care of the Solar and electrical panel installation and made sure to visit the project often to make sure everything was done according to his standards 
It was a really great experience working with Neev and the Treeium team on this project We were definitely impressed by the professionalism and the integrity that both Treeium and Neev held
We recommend Treeium to anyone considering a home remodeling project and we strongly recommend that you ask specifically for Neev should the company allow You wont regret it Thank you Neev and Treeium for all that you have done for us"
5,My overall experience with Treeium and Guy Breuer was fantastic They made me feel at ease with peace of mind though out the duration of the kitchen remodel by letting me know what they were doing or going to do at the end of everyday they were here I felt very comfortable and trust Guy Breuer and his team with my home when I leave the house to go shopping for Christmas gifts The kitchen remodel was completed a little over 3 weeks just in time for my birthday on Christmas I would recommend Treeium and Guy Breuer and his team if youre considering getting a kitchen remodel
5,It was time for us to go through a roof replacement and being something we never plan to do again we were very picky in selecting the contractor who will do the job for us When we met and talked to Erez Shifferman with Treeium he immediately stood out from the crowd with his friendly personality high energy good vibe and real world professionalism Erez is a true asset to his company you could really tell he cares for his customers loves what he does and takes pride in who he does it for Erez explained to us in detail the process of replacing our roof he stood up to his word and provided everything he promised We certainly had an excellent experience with Treeium as a company and Erez as an individual and we will definitely recommend him to anyone we know who might need any construction services A all the way

5,"Kelley here
Guy Borenstein Was my contractor  He was recommended by a family member  I got three estimates in this price range  Guy had the best price  but more he had knowledge and suggestions and facts that the others had not offered  I felt that it would be a more professional job The master bath is gorgeous and well constructed  We gutted it and the team with Maya  Lyle  Moses and Micha and the painter are all experts  They took me shopping and it was a group effort  They were patient with my artistic side Thanks "
5,"As a homeowner I usually dont speak to people who knock on my door and offer services but on that one day a young man Erez Shifferman knocked on my door with a smile and said they were working in my neighborhood which they were He introduced me to their company and what they were doing Overall Erez just made it easy for me to talk to him I was badly in need of a new roof and decided to give it a try After reviewing his companys good history I decided to go with Treeium 

I felt my service was excellent the customer service and attention I received from Erez were really second to none Throughout the project I felt as if I was Erezs only customer and his only running project but I know I was not Im very happy with the service I was given and the new roof I have I already referred Treeium and Erez to a few acquaintances and I will recommend them to anyone who needs work at their home The project was efficiently completed on time and the results are excellent Thank you Erez and Treeium"
5,"Its a rare thing to find a company that offers top quality workmanship excellent speed at getting the work done  and competitive pricing Treeium has delivered on all of the above and more Our project manager Erez Shifferman and his team have worked magic on my 62 yearold ranchstyle home After initially stressing over the thought of hiring and coordinating 5 or 6 individual contractors for a long overdue remodelrenovation we met with Erez  who presented my wife and I with an inclusive energyefficient plan to replace our cedar shingled roof old wood windows and original wood siding with allnew ecofriendly products

Erez was always either available onsite or by cell  and ALWAYS responsive to calls or texts throughout the day or eve a perpetual fear of mine after hearing various accounts of contractorcaused renovationsgonewrong from friends and colleagues to discuss project scheduling and milestones or to address any personal concerns From the demo stage to the final stucco applications Erez would always check in with his team then touch base with me with project progress and updates Throughout the process as Im sure many homeowners are guilty of my wife and I made personal adjustments to our project vision  to which Erez was equally gracious and accommodating Among the many other favorable impressions made by team Treeium was the punctuality and the positive attitude of the crew  and if you happen to live in the SoCal region be sure to request the 3 Georges IMHO these guys bent over backwards to make our home remodel a pleasurable experience

Our project is nearly done the new exterior now looks practically brand new  and I couldnt be happier Personally I found Erezs professionalism to be truly extraordinary He followed through on everything he represented  making sure everything was not just acceptable  but perfectly to my liking In sum I would recommend Treeium to anyone who wants their home to shine"

5,Ive contracted three projects with Treeium with Liran Avital as the project manager  The first and most ambitious was a bathroom renovation  I did my own design for the bathroom which ended up being more work for Liran and his crew than he was originally expecting But even with the increased scope he stuck to his original bid and he got the project done within the time estimate  The project turned out great the bathroom is beautiful  And I was really impressed with everone on his crew  just the right mix of professional and friendly and proud of their craft especially the guys who did our tile work  Im not going to pretend everything was perfect  there were a few minor delays that could have been avoided and on one of the smaller projects a miscommunication about one of the materials used  But weighing everything Liran definitely earned a fivestar review
5,"I interviewed quite a few companies to remodel my bathroom and upgrade my kitchen when Don and Tomir came to give me a quote I was immediately impressed From the beginning of the process I felt confident that I had hired the right team and I felt secure with Robert and his guys being in my home when I wasnt able to be there Don and Tomir were always in contact with me and gave me a schedule so I would always know what was going to happen the next day or in that week 
I am very happy with the quality of the work and I know that if I ever have an issue with any of the work that has been done I can text Don and Tomir and they will take care of me I appreciate the attention and support I have had the whole project Most importantly I love my new bathroom and kitchen"
5,"I am very pleased with Treeium My main contact was Guy Breuer who was very congenial and informative from the beginning Guy originally set me up with Danny who became my architect and worked with me to develop the plans for my addition We added a garage a bathroom an extra room and extended the front room Danny took care of everything with the county and I only had to go to the county office once The plans came out just the way I had foreseen 

The cost was a little more than I wanted to pay but it was well worth it From foundation to roof and everything in between supplies were top grade and so was the workmanship I am very grateful for our foreman Angel he and his crew worked every day some weeks including Sundays to get my project done And to top it all he and Guy kept me informed of their progress and what to expect the following week 

Originally I was told that it would take 3 to 4 months which was accurate since they finished in a little over 3 months and that was with a few delays caused by the rain

I have received nothing but compliments from my neighbors and even random people passing by Thank you Treeium"
5,We were looking an energy efficient remodel that included air conditioning new lighting insulation and window replacement a new electrical panel and were also considering solar We turned to Treeium because we needed a contractor that was eligible to work under Californias PACE program we went with Ygrene for financing and could cover the full scope of services My main points of contact were Neev Kugel and Ofer Dub I found them to be both very responsive to our needs and schedule and pragmatic in their approach The scope grew to include a rewire based on needs dictated by living in an old house though they also recommended to wait for solar before understanding the new energy dynamics postimprovements which insured the investment was going to the most needed items Everything was seamless between Treeium and Ygrene They went the extra mile to make sure we were satisfied with the work Highly recommended
5,I am very pleased with the job Treeium construction and the help of the project manager Liran Avital did on my home  The project included stone flooring carpet all new cabinetry and countertops  My home looks amazing because the meticulous work by this company and the expertise of Liran who made recommendations had the project move along quickly and oversaw work as it was being done
5,From start to finish Treeium has made our visions a reality Equipped with highly trained professionals within the home renovation business they provided great service and products
4,We had a significant remodel on a house we just bought  some would say it was a gut job I dont think a single room remained untouched and we even deliberately moved retaining walls and had to fortify in other areas as a result Treeium came in very competitively priced and provided some legit references ultimately winning the business The work done was solid and Ron Admony  who was our project manager  in particular should be singled out He was on site frequently to supervise the progress and made himself available practically 247 via phone or text In many cases as addenda popped up he would work with us to keep the spend in line Definitely ask for Ron on your project when you call them
5,"I would like to share my story about my experience I had with Treeium

I contacted Treeium to replace my soak in tub with a shower
I have a medical issue with both of my knees and I am having a difficult time entering my tub I am a retired veteran and have been doing physical labor throughout my life which causes my knees to ache 

Guy Borenstein from Treeium came in to give me a bid on the project Guy listened to my needs and advised me on what my opinion were Guys price was more than my budget which I can afford I have not done any construction work for over a decade I just couldnt afford it And was not aware of construction prices in todays market

I told Guy that I cannot afford to do the work at this time
I could sence Guy wanted to help in any way he can and he did smile emoticon

Guy asked if he could step out for a few min to speak to his officeAfter a few min Guy came in and explained to me about a program were Treeium gives back to the Community and there is a possibility that I could qualify to have my bathroom remodel done at no charge and YES FREE


We filled out the application and within a few weeks I found out that Treeum is going to sponsor my poroject and I will be receiving a new bathroom remodel at no charge  I never won anything in my life and cant believe this was happing to meWithin 34 weeks my bathroom was completed and it came out better then I ever dreamed of

I want to thank Treeium and Guy Borenstein for making my life change for better

 Sincerely
 Allan and Terri Hewett"
5,I love my new fireplace tile I found Treeium on Home Advisor and from start to finish the experience was great These guys are the real deal I felt very secure that I was dealing with a legitimate company who has been in OC for many years and who has tons of great reviews I love that they have inhouse contractors for whatever job you need and dont hire subsubtractors to get the work done Both Don Project Manager and Robert Tile Contractor were amazing Don kept in touch throughout the project and Robert went above and beyond to make sure the project was perfect He also kept the workspace clean which was a bonus Overall thrilled with the results and LOVE THIS COMPANY I will definitely call them again for my next project
5,A few months ago my husband and I had Treeium remodel our Master Bathroom Our Project Manager was Neev Kugel and he was absolutely phenomenal to work with We couldnt be happier So recently we decided to do a total remodel on our stairs too so of course we called Neev at Treeium Once again he was excellent to work with Our stairs were done beautifully and as always the customer service and quality of work were all at the highest level Just like our Master Bathroom remodel our Project Manager Neev Kugel was always on top of the project from start to finish We have received so many compliments on our new stairs Thank you Treeium and even more specifically thank you Neev
5,"We are very pleased with our new bathroom Liran Avital was the project manager and he listened well to our description of what we wanted in the remodel Each step of the project was carefully planned and carried out and the finished room meets all our goals and expectations

4,"My name is James Peery I hired Treeium for a bathroom remodel I went on Home Advisors and was given the name of three contractors The only one who called me was Treeium 

I was contacted by project manager Don He showed up on time was very interested in my needs and gave me a quote I found Don to be knowledgeable polite and most of all he was not pushy about me signing with Treeium Don also made it a point to come by the project weekly to check progress

I also dealt with Devon who works in client complaints and quality control I found Devon to be a breath of fresh air who took care of all the issues I wanted addressed Devon even called me on her day off to keep me up to date on the resolution of my issues I wasnt having quality issues as much as I was frustrated with the length of the project and some other minor issues Devon treated all my issues as if they were major and she was always pleasant 

I also dealt with the field quality control manager His name is Dror He was awesome He listened to my concerns took pictures and made sure all the work was done to his standards and mine Dror was great to work with

Overall my remodel turned out great The price didnt change and the work looks awesome I would recommend Treeium for anyone needing construction work done"
3,Very helpful and always great communication The project managers were really wonderful and did their best to try and make sure things were as we wanted
5,Erez Shifferman Sam and their Crew at Treeium showed up on time from day one They are a very professional bunch They took stress off my shoulders when it came to doing mold remediation in my Master Bathroom Even though the job was small they took it VERY seriously because the problem was serious I really thank them all His crew members were clean fast and they very reliable I recommend them 100 Erez was very helpful in explaining the work process Every time I called or texted he answered right away They did an amazing job Sam took it upon himself to make sure that the mold remediation when smooth and clean Great job guys
5,We completed our project on 03152016 Erez Shifferman project manager and his crew did an amazing job on remodeling our master bathroom They converted a walking shower to a roll in shower and lowered one sink to make these wheelchair accessible Erez Shifferman was very professional He keep us informed and he help make this a good experience we would recommend Treeium to others and have them request Erez Shifferman It was a pleasure working with him
5,I just wanted to commend Treeium for an outstanding job My husband and I have worked with a couple of different contractors and this is the best experience we have had by far Our Project Manager Neev was so helpful He was with us every step of the way We never had to wait long for responses to our questions and he was always solution oriented If we had a question he had an answer If we wanted something addressed he made it happen We truly felt like he had our best interest in mind We never felt pressured it was about what was best for us and our project The execution and craftsmanship of our kitchen is beyond our expectations We would highly recommend Treeium and Neev to anyone He made the stressful experience of a kitchen renovation pretty pain free
5,"great general contractor for big jobs thorough bids submitted promptly highly recommended 

their project managers take full ownership of the bidding and supervising process you can tell the employees have high morale and care deeply about their craftsmanship 

for our project they came through with a bid on the bathroom which was fair but the kitchen was not reasonable overall they were 5k over the next lowest bid Still id consider hiring Treeium on future projects they were very honest and not afraid to put things into writing"
4,We had a complete kitchen remodel done changed layout cabinets flooring lighting etc along with extra floor replacement in the hallway and family room After interviewing 3 contractors Treeiums project manager Liran Avital was the only one who really listened to what we wanted as opposed to what is typically done He proposed options and considerations and yes we had to make trade offs but we are so happy with our new kitchen They were very professional about presenting a visual design and juggling things around so we could make better design choices The interior designer Michelle was helpful about promoting design strategies and guiding us in our decision making  Norm the foreman was very on top of the progress and keeping us posted he was always willing to address any of our concerns The work crews  individuals were friendly hard working and clean at the end of every day Treeium was very accommodating about incorporating things which were slightly out of original scope for no extra cost  They approached complications with a positive attitude and changed things to satisfy our requirements    They completed the entire project ahead of schedule  We would hire Treeium again for future remodeling projects
5,I just wanted to say I LOVE the work this company has done Idan Navon was a helpful Production Manager walked me though the complete process The workers on the house did a AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL job on the work done They were ALWAYS on time  trusted my judgement on the tile wood floors  marble counter tops The workers even helped me pack up the house since I had school  work going on  couldnt do it myself Treeium is even helping me finish the payments so I can finish paying for the job done Yes you will pay a little more for the work SO WORTH IT FOR THE WAY YOU ARE TREATED They treat you like family I would recommend then to ANYBODY who needs renovations
5,We did a complete gut and remodel to our master bath  We met with Kobi and Amir and hired them to do the job We received the quality promised at the price promised No hidden costs during or after The finished product is just what we wanted and looks beautiful I would recommend Treeium for and remodel project you have
5,I had such a great experience working with this company I hired them to install a pretty complicated banister since the handyman I haired before had already done a lot of damage that needed fixed The project manager Guy was truly fantastic He walked me through the whole process was always super responsive and made me feel super comfortable with everything The contractor came by upon request after hours to answer some questions and he noticed I was moving in and offered to help out with our move  The crew worked long hours and late to get the job done before the deadline I needed and it looks incredible and feels super sturdy Im so glad I found them and plan to use them to remodel my bathroom next
1,"We were referred to Treeium from an online website  During our initial phone call with them they were very polite friendly and professional  We told them were were looking to do a home addition  We had no plans and no permit  They said they were a full service company which means they can do the plans for us get the permits and build our project  Sounds great  They sent out an email and text to confirm the appointment time

When their estimator arrived it turned into a nightmare  We showed him a rough sketched of what we were looking to do  He didnt both looking at our sketched and told us since we had no plans meaning blue prints and construction documents he cant help us  When I said we were very clear when we made the appointment we do not have plans yet and Treeium would have us come up with one should we decide to move forward  He was not happy with the fact we didnt have a plan then he just threw out a number between 80k to 150k without even looking at what we wanted to do

When I said had I known they needed plans before they gave estimates I would not have had them come out because it was wasting our and his time  His reply Yes you are wasting my time  Those were his exact words  After he said that I sent him on his way  He was only at our house for five minutes  

I called Treeium back and informed them what happened  The lady who answer the phone pulled up our request and she said it clearly stated we had no plans no permits and looking for an estimate  She apologized and offered to send someone else out  I was so upset at this point I told her there is no need

I took the day off from work the appointment was at 10am on a Wednesday to meet with them  I clearly wasted a day of work for a fruitless meeting  Poor service from their estimator very rude and extremely unprofessional"
5,My experience with Treeium and my project manager Ron Admony has been fabulous I was lucky enough to have stubbled upon Ron and Treeium as they were finishing a remodel in my neighborhood and was so impressed with their work I went over to talk with Ron He immediately came over to my house and gave me his recommendations for my remodel projects Not only was I so pleased with his ideas but also that he took time to come over himself as he said he would that I hired Treeium They  have continued to offer amazing customer service and quality work   I have used Treeium for my solar installation remodeling of  bathrooms replacing kitchen counters interior painting acoustic ceiling removal and electrical work throughout my entire house Their staff shows up as scheduled on time and will not leave until the work is completed to your satisfaction  They all aim to please and will work with you to make sure the end result is what you want  My project manager Ron Admony  is amazing and has become a true friend always available for any questions or concerns and makes sure that the Treeium staff knows exactly what I am expecting  I highly recommend Treeium and Ron Admony as your project manager for all your remodel needs they will make any home project painless
5,This is a review if Sam Deen and his crew  Im in the middle of a bathroom remodel I originally contacted Treeium for an estimate to replace a shower in my second bath From the very start I was very impressed with Sam Deen the project manager Not only did he arrive on time he was amicable yet professional I need several repairs to my home so after we walked through the bathroom I asked Sam to provide me with an estimate for the other projects Not only did he provide me with an itemized estimate that covered everything he also provided me with individual itemized estimates Sam and I discussed my budget and agreed to start with remodeling the first bathroom Never have I experienced a contractor who listens and understands  Sam made my best interest his first priority and not how much profit he could make Sam is reliable trustworthy and compassionate  He understands the concerns financial constraints and yes the anxiety inherent to remodeling Sam  guided me through design selecting the tile fixtures vanity etc He is 100 dedicated to his customers satisfaction I have become accustomed too and look forward to Sams morning call and his arriving in the morning along with which ever craftsman that is needed for the day  On the rare occasions he is not present Sam is on the telephone andor sending a text message If I have any questions or need clarification hes a phone call away I believe his leadership and presence has helped to the project on schedule His crew is equally amazing  They are focused and respectful of your home  The work area is kept orderly and all traces of materials or debris is completely removed by the end of the day  Words cannot express how satisfied I am so far  I am confident  the finished project will be exactly what I expect  If youre looking for a general contractor I highly recommend you call Treeium and  ask for Sam Deen  You want be disappointed  Ill update this review when the project has been completed
5,"I have decided to hire Treeium to do my Kitchen Remodel and I couldnt be happier About a month ago I met who would later become our project manager Mr Neev Kugel and our experience of working with him has been nothing short of great His professionalism experience and attention to details is what made us decide to move forward with him to begin with but boy were we in luck Neev kept us uptodated at all times throughout our project He made sure all of his workers came on time and completed their job in a timely and professional manner He went over and beyond to make sure we were happy at any stage of our project and even included a few extra line items that were not even included in our original agreement I was hesitant about who I was going to hire to do our project but I am so happy we eventually decided to pick Treeium and Im delighted to have had the chance to work with our project manager Neev

Thank you Treeium for giving us the Kitchen of our dreams and thank you Neev for everything"
5,Our new kitchen is almost finished and weve been very impressed with the work of Kobi Farkash and his Treeium team since Day 1 Theyre organized clean communicative and keep to their planned schedule The quality of the cabinets is excellent The granite finishing work is fantastic The onsite work quality has been very good and the workers seem to be proud of their work and like what theyre doing Kobi overcommunicates  he texts every evening or morning to remind us whats happening the next day If weve brought up something to him his onsite worker knows almost immediately Kobi has an answer for everything He is a great problemsolver too  when something didnt quite look right he came up with several solutions to choose from We would highly recommend Kobi as your Project Leader
4,My bath remodel experience with Treeium was positive  The crews at all stages of the remodel showed up on time each morning  There were minor issues that came up but project manager Guy Barnea addressed the issues quickly  I liked how I was able to order the vanity and tile with the contractor discount  I received everything I asked for and the result is a bathroom I enjoy
5,"My name is Pamela Van Horn and Ive met Ron Poliker after Ive signed a contract with another company Ron have heard that I signed the contract yet came back after 5 hours to make sure I was not been taken advantage of He came at 8 pm and reviewed the contract with me and pointed out that there are errors over sites and over pricing I contacted the other company and canceled the checks and Ron made sure they will not harass me any more He gave me a much better price and much broader service the crew was fast and professional Ron came in every day and listened to my needs He had a manage fly in from the head quarters in LA to look after the project Ron is my guardian Angel 
Thank you very much Ron Poliker
Treeium is amazing"
5,We planned to have our kitchen remodel in late of 2014 with limited budget and had three estimated quotes  We almost made up our decision with the 2nd contractor and went to his showroom to see and choose the cabinets door with color  the counter top our decision already decided before we have the meeting with Ron Admony from Treeium   Ron Admony Project Manager from Treeium was the last one that contacted us for the third quotation and had an appointment which we thought we only gave two hours for his presentation as a social manner but we ended up to pick Ron from Treeium EVEN with highest price of the three quotations  We are very happy that we picked Ron as our Project Manager he was consistent to provide his support and helping us to finish the project ahead of the deadline  As the rule of thumb everything was not smooth and easy as we were looking for during our remodeling kitchen there were few obstacles that impacted the progress and may delay the schedule but Ron Admony was always available either by phone or by coming to contact us regarding of any issues that we encountered when the project started until finished  He responded to our questions or concerns any time that we had in couple hours or personally came to help us to resolve the issues  He also provided his inputs to help our decision on color counter top andor anything that will help our remodeling kitchen looks prettier  His goal is always to make sure his customer satisfaction and happy  Its really a learning lesson to remodel the kitchen and were glad that we picked Treeium with Ron Admony as our project manager to work on our project  The final reward was our beautiful kitchen and our family really enjoyed  Thanks Ron Admony for great job well done and were sure to contact you for our next project  Treeium could be the contractor if you need to pick for any home improvement projects and special Ron Admony will be your Project Manger
5,"Even if you know what you are doing any kind of home improvement is potentially very scary  There are so many things that can go wrong or unexpected problems that can arise  So it has been my experience to hire a contractor that is a professional  knows what he is doing  
I am very comfortable  confident in recommending Guy Barnea  Treeium for your home improvement project
I dont write a lot of reviews and most are when something goes wrong 
But in this case I recognize how important to find a qualified personcompany to do contracting workand want to share with everyone my very positive experience
His prices are very competitivenot the cheapestbut the cheapest price normally gets you the cheapest workwhich usually makes it ultimately not the cheapest And why would you not want the best quality work possible
Guys attention to detail only made me extremely comfortable  confident about my expectations Everyone from his laborers to supervisors accomplished everything I had asked for and Guys output only made the hurdles minimal and made me a very satisfied customer  
I think the best thing I can sayis if and when I have another remodeling projectI now need to make one phone callwhich makes this process even better
Great Work Guy  TreeiumI couldnt be happier "
5,"I had my master bathroom done and they did a great job They are professional and on time with the schedule They even worked extra hours 
to complete the project I highly recommended this company"
4,Great job Treeium Good customer service Guy Borenstein  Sal Quality workmanship Your guys were willing to go the extra mile to make our experience less stressful They clean up at the end of the day put furniture back if they had to move them The project was done 1 week later than scheduled otherwise you would have gotten 5 stars
5,We decided to remodel our outdated kitchen and found Treeium on a home improvement website  After making an appointment Guy Breuerthe project managercame to discuss our needs and gave us an estimate  The project entailed a full gut of the kitchen which went very smoothly with a minimal amount of dirt and dust  Rene the foreman and his crew did a very good job of being on time and finishing the project in a reasonable 312 weeks  All through the renovation Guy was available to help with the choosing of finishes and design choices  Though any renovation is stressful the crew from Treeium made the experience a little less so  We would definitely recommend Treeium
3,I am in the middle of the project  Guy Borenstein has been my contact and very helpful and cooperative in the planning process
5,They replaced the my 24 year old roof that was leaking With the materials they  use and the cost I am set for next 30 years
5,They not only got my kitchen done by Christmas Kobi and his team were amazing I will definitely use them again and strongly recommend Treeium
5,We just recently completed our first bathroom remodel  We had received multiple job estimates but chose Treeium because of the excellent presentation by Kobi who would be the assigned project manager  He listened to our needs and wishes and gave us clear and concise planning projections  They met all of the goals and we are so pleased with the outcome  In fact we were so pleased that we had them do a complete house rewire and interior paint job  The work crews were all extremely professional and took great efforts to accommodate advise and complete the work within the promised timelines  The different disciplines were knowledgable with their respective field of expertse  Kobi visited the site often and ensured excellent communication between the crews  In one instance there was a minor glitch with an electrical outlet  Within one hour of our call the PM had an electician out to check it out  All around outstanding service  Would use this company again
5,Treeium is the BEST  We worked with Meir Barzilai and right from the beginning he was extremely professional always on time and courteous  Our project was completed on time and within our budget  We will always use Treeium for any future projects  Work with Meiryou wont be disappointed
1,I have been very dissatisfied and frustrated so far with my experience with Treeium Work started and there were immediately issues after demolition and it took two days to get someone to come out and take a look Communication has been very poor and they havent communicated a project plan I continually have to ask whenif someone is going to come out instead of being kept in the loop I keep taking time off from work and no one shows up
5,I LOVE Trrium  I built a brand new 3000 Sq Foot Luxury Home in Malibu and they installation of Tilesmarblegranite was flawless  Not a single complaint  Meir Barzilai and his team are professional trustworthy and courteous  The job was completed on time and within our budget  Meir was at our home daily to oversee and make sure the job was proceeding to his quality and standards  Extremely handson and very focused team with tons of experience i would highly recommend to anybody
5,"We recently had our new Laguna Woods home renovated by Treeium  After an initial rocky start with a person no longer with the company owner Moty Ginsburg had Ron Admony take over as our Project Manager and he has been excellent to work with diligent in keeping our project on track and has been completely honest with us in all our dealings 
 
The project is completed and we are very happy with the results   We had Treeium add a walkin shower in one bathroom and make the second into an onsuite master bath  In addition they created a laundry closet and opened up the kitchen to allow for a large refrigerator with custom cabinets  To accomplish this they needed to demolish walls borrow into the slab for new drainage create two new walkin showers and a new master closet  They installed a beautiful glass bowl vanity and custom linen closet in the master bathroom with glass tiles in the shower and along the back of the vanity  With Ron at the helm and a very able crew including Luis Arturo Juan and Alex they were able to get the project to a stage where we could move in on time and then they completed the last stages of the project without delay  We have received many compliments on how the project turned out and everyone who sees it agrees that Treeium did a great job  I am attaching photos so you can see the results however they do not do it justice  

We highly recommend Ron Admony and Treeium to do your next project  Not only will they handle your project with professionalism they understand how important this is to you and treat you and your property with respect"

5,"Guy came ready to make our family feel like we dont need any further consultations 
He was
Friendly Called ahead to let us know he was on his way
Great communicator IMPORTANT Listens to every idea and executes it
EnthusiasticReally excited to get the job
ProfessionalCame with his Badge around his neck w ID and License
Artistic Visualized something we would have never considered

So I had researched many different companies to get an estimate on the remodeling process at my mothers home Going through of course Houzz HGTV magazines remodeling guides internet and local ads Guy made us look no further 

My family got larger within the year with the birth of our 1 year old son and paying 1650 for a leased home without utilities car payments insurances and daily expenses We decided to make some changes To minimize our costs We plan to remodel the home to make it two private family areas
My Mother owns a home in a prime location in Atwater Village and it currently has 7 bedrooms 4 restrooms 2 kitchens 1 laundry area 2 large living rooms and dining rooms and a large front yard and back yard Not to mention also the garage  

I had numerous consultations about building UP and making it it a two story home 
Until Guy Once he looked at the place he was so inspired that he actually got me excited after being disappointed with high quotes and bad communication of what we are trying to achieve
He said the house has a large enough in square footage and that we do NOT need to build up Mind you building up you are looking at more time Money and hard to get permits Almost a 230000000 job which I still have all the past contractors calling and harassing me He said that the house is large enough to accommodate two different families with their own private area entrance etc 
He said that it was just not designed right It looks like a maze All we really had to do is rearrange all aspects of the house with a good floor plan knock down walls and since pluming is underground  with crawl space that would be the fastest easiest and inexpensive solution HE MADE MY DAY

Out of so many consultations NOBODY gave me that option I knew then he wasnt there to just get a job and take my money 
Anyways he came through a few days later with his virtual 3D designer and she measured the whole house and told me that she will design a likable livable layout and email it to me with the draft including my furniture All I had to do is send her photos of my current furniture to incorporate them in the visual display How awesome I can edit and change everything to our liking I am just so excited on the actual construction which I can not review about since we are not there yet 
So far So good But I will definitely update my thoughts throughout the process"
5,"My review is way overdue it was around this time last year  that I hired Kobi who is one of the greatest project managers Ive ever dealt with I had a fantastic experience with the entire team of Treeium Today Im visiting their office to review my electricity bill with them to install solar panels on my house  Their office is just beautiful the staff is just amazing and super friendly It was very nice to actually put a face behind the voice I would personally like to thank Elizabeth for helping me finance my project at great rates which I can afforded 

My first project was a kitchen remodel that Kobi he met all of my expectations and more He made my dream kitchen a reality  The cleanup crew was fantastic I never had to worry about picking up after the contractors when they were finished for the day 

I have recommended Treeium and Kobi to my friend which hired them as well and is super happy with her project as well Im looking forward to installing my solar panels on my house"
5,"I was looking for a company to do my master and main bathroom renovations but wanted to start out with a smaller project first  stairwell ceiling refinishing and painting  to see how well the company managed the project  I was initially interested in Treeium because I liked the idea that their company was doing their part to be a little more green  

From the very first meeting with my project manager through to the end of the project I felt I had all the information about what they could do with my project and how they would go about meeting my ideas

When we ran into an unexpected structural problem that required additional work before we could move on my project manager was able to quickly adjust the contract and all the work was still entirely completed on schedule

Having used a number of different contractors for other big projects in my home I appreciated most that they took care of the little things to make the whole project look complete  They removed some fixtures to work through the whole space instead of taking the short cut of just working around the fixtures They caulked the gaps left from previous work so that it would blend in perfectly with their work  And they did some extra finishing on a couple of the walls so that the painting would look even more precise

I was very pleased with the work Treeium did and the ease of working with them and am planning my bathroom renovations with them now"
5,We selected Horizon Construction  Remodeling for our 1954 raised floor homes main bathroom We had new electric plumbing and more to support a modern bidet toilet deep soak tub tile work custom cabinet as well as faucets and fixtures in an older and smaller style home David planed and scheduled the work on time and to costs which passed all city inspections Any questions discrepancies and requests as our bathroom walls and floors were opened items installed or final finish and refinements were promptly addressed to satisfaction Enna Eskin also followed through on all administrative matters and various communications as the project progressed A special thanks to the electricians and tile workers that were very professional educational skilled and made value added recommendations for our decisionmaking Thanks Horizon Construction 
5,"This is our second remodel with Horizon construction  remodeling
We remodeled another bathroom last year with them
David our project manager was really good and helpful as always 

If we have anything else to remodel we will definitely call them "
5,Horizon construction  remodeling did a fabulous job on my bathroom The work was above excellent Workers were timely thoughtful  and professional I would recommend  Horizon to anyone
5,"I recently remodeled my house and was sorely disappointed  I was a bit gun shy to try again but changed my mind after being stuck ay home during the covid lockdown 


I decided to find a new contractor and was lucky enough to find Mark Besnos the owner of Horizon Construction and Remodeling


Mark was able to make my vision a  reality which was no small task  He worked with my designer Misti Riedel and I and had the patience of a saint  This time around it was an enjoyable experience  


I wake up every morning and walk out into the main living area with a big smile on my face  Before Mark remodeled my place was so drab  

I truly love my house and thank everyone for helping me"
5,"We selected Horizon Construction  remodeling in Fullerton because of their high rated reviews and we felt very comfortable with David Eskin the project manager we thought he will be a good match since we will need to communicate with him on daily basis for the entire length of our remodel He helped us design our new kitchen and bathroom and select materials while keeping up to code
we wanted to achieve clean and simple look more space on our counters along with timeless design 
The results exceeded our expectations We love it"
5,"This my experience with Horizon Construction and Remodeling
and why I recommend them
This is the second time that I have hired a contractor The first time was a bathroom remodel and it was a disaster so I was very apprehensive about hiring another contractor  We needed to remodel our kitchen so I had no choice I did my due diligence and research and called three companies to interview All three I had no prior knowledge of or experience with Out of the three bids there was a high a medium and a low
After talking to them one more time I went with the medium bid company That company is called Horizon Construction and Remodeling It turns out I made the right choice My experience with this company is the complete opposite from my first experience with a contractor 
My Project Manager was Mark who did an outstanding job of keeping the project moving quickly efficiently His crews showed up on time were professional and did quality work from plumbing to electrical to framing to painting to cabinets all were done to my satisfaction If something was not done to my satisfaction which was rare I just let Mark know about it and he would send someone to either redo or touchup the work Mark would visit the job site frequently
I feel Mark is honest and has his customers best interest at heart There were a couple of times when he could have charged me extra money for items that came up during the project but he did not 
Like any project we had to make some changes along the way and Mark is very willing to work with you to make sure that you get what you want Mark will listen to your ideas plus he has many ideas himself He helped us a lot with our kitchen design
They started my project Oct 11 2001 My wife and I were hoping to have the project done by Christmas They had it done in 7 weeks in time for Thanksgiving
The inside staff is led be Enna They make sure everything is ordered on time They even arrange for inspections They are very polite and efficient and responsive
We are doing our doors and windows next and we going to have Horizon Construction and Design do the work
I recommend Horizon Construction and Design I give them a strong 10

5,We recently just finished a remodel of two bathrooms using Horizon for the project They were easy to work with and worked hard to accommodate a house with four people working from home Working with their design team installers and trades people the entire project came together without issue They even helped us by doing some things out of order to ease the burden of a family of four using just one working bathroom  But the real payoff was in the end product For that a picture is worth a 1000 words We are so pleased with our new bathrooms Thank you to the team at Horizon
5,Such a pleasure to work with Mark and the entire staff at Horizon Construction Not only did they remodel our entire house filled with furniture during a pandemic but we did the whole process from out of town Mark and his staff kept us constantly up to date via Zoom phone calls and loads of texts and emails And the best part is the house turned out better than expected They made sure the work was done exactly the way we planned and to our expectations which included guaranteeing anything that went wrong Mark was a big help in the design process which included helpful advise on where we should spend money and where we could cut corners He also had little things done along the way some that he didnt charge us for but that were necessary to make the house look more finished Lastly they took great care in making sure the furniture and home decor were protected and covered during the whole process and whatever was moved was put back where they found it  We are so grateful for the hard work service and patience that went into making our house look beautifully updated
5,So happy to have gone with Horizon Construction for our major kitchen and 2 bath remodel project From the first meeting with Mark the owner I felt that he was trustworthy knowledgeable and fair He and the Horizon Construction crews did not disappoint Communication with Mark Enna and the office staff were admirable Marks design expertise was very helpful He met all of our wants  needs Our kitchen was taken from a poorly designed eyesore to a beautiful space We had major structural work removal of load bearing beams and steel moment frame installing three steel beams at the ceiling to create an open floor plan We completely changed the footprint of the kitchen Custom cabinets turned out beautifully The materials purchased through Horizon Design were of high quality and sourced in a timely manner Workers were friendly arrived on time and cleaned up at the end of each day We were so pleased with the kitchen that we added on two bath remodels which were completed along with the kitchen Thank you Horizon for delivering a quality space which we are happy to invite our friends  family to We will enjoy the beautiful kitchen  bathrooms for many years to come
5,"Horizon construction  Remodeling remodeledupdated both my master and the main bathrooms which were in their original mid60s construction state  David Eskin and his team of tradesmen helped bring my vision to fruition  As with any project once the walls were opened up some revisions were required based upon their expertise and experience Horizon was able to provide a few suggestions and a few tweaks to address these revisions  I couldnt be happier with the results Both bathrooms are much more functional and beautiful
Horizon also did some minor improvements in my laundry area  again improving the functionality and looks
Note Remodeling costs did not cover much of the material costs  I had already selected andor purchased some of the building materials I did research and purchase much of the remaining materials tub vanities tiles Horizon does have its own showroom and could have provided these at an additional cost  However because I already had a firm idea as to what I wanted I handled the ordering of these myself"
5,"Our kitchen was remodeled by Mark Besnos and Enna at Horizon Construction and Remodeling We chose them after seeing all the great reviews on the Houzz app When we walked into their showroom we were warmly greeted by Diana who made us feel very comfortable  Their product display made it easy for us to put our ideas together Marks crew did a wonderful job  Kudos to his crew they really worked hard Joel Chavez was a standout carpenterjack of all trades doing much of the major work and tying together any imperfections and any loose ends that arose with a great attitude expertise and skill Hes quite an asset to Horizon  Antonio Garcia who did our fabulous backsplash and Tom Tzur was the electrician  Mark ensured that each phase of the project was done correctly and completed on time about 8 weeks We gutted and replaced our 80s kitchen 10 by 10 including the small dining area We kept the same layout but switched the positions of the sink stove and refrigerator  Enna helped with all the communication and paperwork and scheduling of the inspections payments etc  Thanks to Mark Enna and their crew we have a beautiful modern kitchen with two toned white and blue cabinets  
Lessons Learned
1Stick to your budget and have extra funds for unforeseen things because for sure there will always be something that will come up  Understand what is and is not included in your contract  Dont just assume that everything is included
2Be flexible with your time There is a general outline of what jobs will be done in order mostly during the weekdays but things may change with short notice  
3Check that your materialscolors are in stock before you sign your contract Due to the Covid and political environment some materials may take longer to get or not at all  Some newer colors may cost more
4Look at your cabinet colors in every light  We first looked at an espressocolored cabinet that looked like black in shade and looked light cherry colored under the full sun 
5Know what crown molding you want for the top of your cabinetshaving pictures will help
6Ask Mark if you are not sure of any detail or work that has to be done Do not wing itelse any fixes may cost you extra 
7For lighting such as chandeliers measure everything Use you tube to learn to measure your lighting fixtures
8Certain changes such as electrical structural will require city permits and inspections  Your citys inspectors availability will cause delays up to one week 
9Choose your grout color for the backsplashapparently theres a ton of them we were looking at different shades of grey because white is too hard to clean 
10Choose your door and doorknobs ahead of time Check to make sure it works including deadbolt after its been installed
11Choose your baseboard style and size
12Choose your light dimmers switches"
5,"After shopping several companies we chose Horizon Construction and Remodeling for our home improvement project which was to enlarge and update our kitchen and main bathroom  In addition we converted all of our flooring to vinyl
We are extremely happy with the service responsiveness dependability and the results Horizon provided  David Eskin was our project manager  David became a consultant and friend during the process  He proved to be patient and honest when we encountered an issue with the granite installation for our kitchen  We upgraded our material to a beautiful and unique Brazilian granite for our kitchen counter  Our initial granite slab cracked 3 feet across the width of the counter 2 days after installation  David and his crew reviewed the issue and without hesitation or argument removed the cracked granite and replaced it with a new slab at their cost  Although this experience was extremely stressful for all the integrity displayed by David and Horizon was stellar and unique in the construction industry  Contractors are easy to find but an honest and dependable one is rare in our opinion  On this experience alone we would recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling without reservation  They made it right
All construction is stressful and we lived in our house during the remodel  This project was our first in this home but our fourth major reconstruction in our 45 years of marriage  Horizon was by far the best remodel experience"
5,We were referred to Horizon Construction and Remodeling from my sisters coworker at Houzz for a full kitchen remodel Our consultation went wonderfully and we felt very comfortable with David He did a great job explaining their company and the process for our kitchen remodel He was able to take all of our ideas for the kitchen and make them a reality He was honest and helpful throughout the whole process and we did not have to stress about all the things you hear other people having to go through during a remodel He was quick to respond to any emails calls or texts The only thing I wish we would have received without asking for was a weekly schedule on what was happening each day and who we would be expecting at the house and what time so we could plan ahead as full time working parents Overall we were very happy with every contractor who worked on the kitchen We do not have one complaint about any of the people that came into our house throughout the remodel We would highly recommend Horizon to our families and friends for any future remodeling and would us them again in the future We feel that we now have our dream kitchen thanks to the team at Horizon Construction and Remodeling
5,We had a fairly large relatively unused laundry room and a guest bedroom without an attached guest bathroom  After hunting for a contractor I met Michael who was really friendly had a clear cut understanding of what I was looking to do without much back and forth and gave me a break down quote for each aspect of the project in a fast and timely fashion We converted our downstairs bedroom into a mini master suite with an attached bathroom French doors where a window once was and sound proofing of the walls to prevent noise from our flat screen in the family room that shares a wall We then made a smaller laundry nook Albeit a few scheduling communication errors everything was done with care and what I really liked was how Michael would come and look at things and notice stuff that I didnt even see and get them fixed and or corrected on his routine walk throughs Additionally the workers that would come to the house never made me feel uncomfortable or worried
5,"We recently remodeled our Master bathroom and chose Horizon Construction  Remodeling in Fullerton to do the job  Overall we had a great experience We were given a fair price for our remodel and the quality of work was excellent  Everyone we worked with was polite courteous and professional  Any minor issues that came up were addressed promptly and correctly  Our bathroom looks a million times better is a lot more functional  Bravo to David our General Contractor and his crew  We would definitely recommend Horizon Construction  Remodeling to anyone and we plan to use them again for our next remodeling project

5,When you realize you need work done by a contractor a lot of apprehension may go through your mind  But those fears and doubts will be washed away if you choose to work with Horizon Construction  Remodeling in Fullerton CA 92832   We dealt mostly with David and from our first meeting we had a good feeling about working with him and Horizon   David really listened to our ideas and gave us a few of his own which we never would have thought about   While we wanted to do a few small projects as well painting all rooms in our house with new flooring lighting and baseboards our big decision was to remodel our kitchen    This was a complete gut down to the bare bones of the room then build it back up  Throughout the entire process David made frequent visits to check on progress answer questions and if something needed to be looked into he was on it right away  His team always came as scheduled and we were always looped in every step of the way   Davids timeline for completion was right on target as well   It helps that we too were always ready with whatever we needed to provide such as ordering and delivery of our new kitchen appliances picking lighting fixtures and paint colors and coming to the show room to pick out our flooring cabinetry countertops and back splash  And by the way their showroom has a large array of options to choose from  We even had a few lastminute thoughts of having the facing of our fireplace redone and adding some extra lighting in the home to which David accommodated easily  Even with a few snags due to Covid 19 whereas the countertop and backsplash we picked which had been on order for months was suddenly unavailable his team was on it and helped us pick back up options to which we found we loved more than our original choices   In the office we also worked at times with Maria and Enna both of whom were pleasant knowledgeable and helpful to us    Davids team was courteous and respectful and followed safety protocols like wearing masks   Since we worked from home it was easy to practice distancing since we were all in different rooms  And if the workers needed to speak to us everyone wore masks and stood apart out of courtesy    We were overwhelmed with how beautiful the kitchen turned out and were just as pleased with how refreshed and updated our whole interior looks now   We would highly recommend working with the team at Horizon because this experience helped us rest those apprehensions I spoke of in the beginning   And we achieved what we wanted in that now when you walk in our kitchen you just say WOW  Thank you
4,We had our completely remodeled removed a loadbearing wall to open up the kitchen to the den We also did a full remodel on our small master bathroom to create a big master bath with a small walkin closet which we did not have before Also our laundry room was moved to the hallway along with some change orders along the way We are very happy with the end result and we are enjoying our new home
5,"Excellent results What was once a dirty moldy ugly bathroom now looks like a spa bathroom in a Vegas hotel Im still amazed at the transformation even now that its been operational for a while 

David was very responsive to texts and always followed up to be sure things were going well and even when I wanted a big heavy mirrored medicine cabinet against his recommendation he graciously had the backsplash tiles adjusted so the back wall could be rewired then hung the mirror and now it looks great At least I think it does

I wanted a particular finish on the cabinets but he advised to go much darker which was counterget itintuitive to me but he was absolutely right and the dark cabinets contrast perfectly with the earthtones and creams throughout the rest of the bathroom Im glad for his recommendation as it maintains the warm design while providing an elegant touch 

I can be a difficult client but David was gracious throughout and his subcontractors all did a great job and were very pleasant I also appreciate that while it wasnt the biggest project just a smallish bathroom he gave it his all and treated it like a project of any size I was actually rejected by a couple of contractors because the project wasnt big enough but David and Horizon gave it their all I cant be happier with the end result  the transformation is nothing short of remarkable"
5,David Eskin with Horizon Construction and Remodeling did a great job coordinating the remodel All the trades did an excellent job Any issues were responded to and fixed immediately We are very happy with the finished product and will use them again in the future
5,"We are happy to see the remodeling is completed  I am satisfied with the materials chosen and the suggestions made throughout the process  Alicia and Mark Besnos collaborated in choosing the design materials  We look forward to many years of our new bathrooms   
Thank you Horizon Construction  Remodeling for the remodels

Brian and Alicia Dolan"
5,"I had an excellent experience with David from Horizon Construction on an exterior project recently completely and would recommend them highly for any project internal or external

David was extremely professional throughout the entire process  From the initial call and consultation we tossed ideas back and forth his vision was exactly what I was looking for  He promptly sent images of ideas and websites for me to review and even though we didnt exactly meet at times he was flexible to accept my idea and in the end we came up with something I am very proud of    To be honestthere where issues but not with him   He came through and directed his team to fix not only things I found but even things that did not fit his image of perfectionhe never flinched his quality was excellent and did not let his team fall behind   Again I am extremely happy with the service vision and final product and would recommend them anytime you have a project you want perfection"
5,"Having chosen Horizon Construction  Remodeling for our project was the best decision we could have made  The Project Manager Eitan Beznos made sure that we were completely satisfied 

every step of the way making sure that all of our concerns were addressed  He was very pleasant and easy to communicate with  The completed job looks amazing we could not be 

more satisfied and we get many compliments from strangers that walk or drive by  A big kudos to all those involved in the project and we will most definitely recommend Horizon to 

our friends neighbors and family

5,"The upstairs bath had been partially remodeled prior to purchasing my condo 5 years ago It had an updated vanity and lavatory but the tub and shower combination were the original fiberglass buildergrade enclosure and definitely showed its age of 30 plus years I wanted this bathroom to look as good as the rest of my home with a new tub new tile and new flooring
Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc expertly gave me exactly the bath I desired Horizons showroom had ample samples of tiles and I was easily able to select the bathshower wall tile and flooring that unified my vision I did not have to wait long for the job to commence and all work was done as quickly as I could have hoped The only delays were due to unavoidable waiting for inspections and a holiday that delayed one inspection For those tasks that did not require an inspection to proceed the trade contractor would show up the following morning I was able to have my walls retextured and painted a new overhead light added above the bathshower replace the medicine cabinet and a new exhaust fan and all fixtures installed for the completed beautifully finished bathroom
My project manager David Eskin coordinated each trade and supplies wonderfully All of the contractors selected for my project were very professional and I appreciate how quickly and well each performed their trade work I am delighted with workmanship and the end results"
4,"We had a kitchen and powder room remodel Aug Oct 2020 We love the final product It is pretty much exactly what We envisioned The project finished in a timely manner and his guys did a phenomenal job especially tile Fernando and cabinets sorry I dont remember everyones name Mark was knowledgeable and answered our questions promptly He was good at showing up frequently and reviewing all the work 

My only suggestion for improvement would be giving a more accurate estimate and notifying the owners of the cost of any changes prior to the work being done The project ended up quite a bit more than anticipated However we are happy with the result and would recommend Horizon to others"
5,We had our kitchen entirely redone by Horizon Construction  Remodeling Horizon replaced our cabinets sink inserted a backsplash rewired our receptacles to meet current code and repainted the walls They also installed recessed lighting under the cabinets which really brings out the ambiance of the kitchen overall It was a complex operation and they projectmanaged it flawlessly They took a lot of time to truly understand what we wanted and then provided examples and expertise to help guide us to our final decisions We could not recommend them more for anyone looking to remodel their kitchen
5,"On behalf of my husband and myself we highly recommend Horizon Construction for your home projects This recommendation letter is long overdue We hired Horizon Construction Inc in the summer of 2019 to gut and remodel a master bedroom bath and install a sliding glass door Michael the construction manager was very transparent with us about the timeline and the steps and costs Everything was done exactly as he said

To begin with the contract manager Michael was an utmost professional We told him what we wanted and he gave us a reasonable estimate that closely matched our own estimated costs As recommended before committing to hiring a contractor we requested 2 other estimates one came in ridiculously higher than Horizon and one quite a bit lower than Horizon but we went with Horizon because of Michaels evident knowledge and on spot recommendations The meeting with the other contractors didnt leave my husband or I with the same confidence in amount of knowledge of process and esthetic know how In the long run Michaels trained eye for function and aesthetic helped us come up with a design that we are extremely happy with

Their entire crew was extremely knowledgeable and efficient We were extremely pleased with their attention to detail and craftsmanship"
5,"We did our master bath remodeling this year and we chose Horizon construction for the second time Mark the owner as usual came up with the perfect design for our relatively small space The design let us include a big shower closed bathroom area and lots of closets Something I did not think we could accomplished at first
The construction went fast considering the City closure for Covid19 They did a fantastic job and kept everything clean during the construction
We now have a very beautiful Master Bath we enjoy every day I recommend Horizon Construction for any remodeling you need They are very good at what they do"
5,Professional work done by professional workers in a professional way We highly recommend Horizon for any home improvement or repair that you might do Last year Horizon repaired the stucco wood trim and painted our house The paint started to peel on part of the trim and they promptly repaired it at no charge We are also happy with the patio cover they did for us last year   Steve an Toni G
5,"Our wrought iron fence was on its last leg already rotted through  We wanted a short block wall topped by a vinyl fence I found Horizon Construction on a couple of the help websites and called them Eitan Beznos came out discussed the job and provided an estimate We came to an agreement and they started the next week The block wall went fast they finished the 2 H x 60 L wall in one day It is on top of a steep 60 tall hill  The job was completed in a timely manner  All along Eitan kept me aware of progress and status  He came out to inspect the job At the end Eitan and the company ownermanager came out and inspected the job to make sure we were satisfied  We could not have been anymore satisfied with the work the timeliness and the cleanup efforts Horizon finished the job on the originally forecast completion date  I would recommend Horizon and Eitan Beznos for any construction or remodeling efforts you might have

5,We got bids from 5 different contractors for the construction we needed in our backyard We were converting our garage into an additional dwelling unit ADU which has very specific requirements in most cities David Eskin came out from Horizon they were the last bid we received All the bids came in just about the same ballpark but we chose Horizon because David seemed very upfront and personable at our first meeting He took the time to address our questions and concerns all of them even if we didnt particularly want to hear the answers We trusted him We live in a historical home so there were many rules we needed to follow and styles we needed to match exactly David his crew and Horizon did that perfectly We ran into some problems because our house is old They couldnt have been foreseen because nobody knew what was under our garage Those problems were frustrating and added expense to our project but David and Enna at the office helped us through those as well The interior turned out so much better than we imagined it would Its just beautiful We would recommend Horizon to anyone needing to get any work done in or around their home Awesome company
5,"Eitan Beznos of Horizon Construction did a major Remodeling on my kitchen bathrooms bedrooms and garage This included
New patio slab
Removal of wall and load bearing 4x4s
Kitchen island
Fireplace
New roof
New ceiling
Complete rewire of house and garage 
Power panel upgrade and electric car charger in garage
Paint interior and exterior

Eitan was the project manager He was easy to work with and there was good communication with Eitan and the office staff The process was clearly written down and all questions were answered

I did not know exactly what I wanted and Eitan made useful suggestions He designed the layouts and helped me select materials for the floor ceiling kitchen counters and bathrooms

Eitan pulled permits and all of the inspections were passed
There were often several teams of workers in the house at the same time Eitan coordinated the work to insure that the progress was efficient and that different groups did not get into each others way

When problems came up Eitan dealt with them Termite damage was discovered and had to be addressed before a bathroom could be completed
Building codes required that work had to stop when old flooring was removed by a hazmat company

While I thought that the quotes were high what I got were clear goals quality of work management of workers problem resolving and the overall progress of the project

I was very satisfied with the end result The open floor plan between kitchen and family room and the removal of cupboards in the hallway makes the house look very expansive The transformation was stunning

I would recommend Eitan for home remodeling

5,If youre shopping contractors and want to avoid a nightmare read this Licensed contractors are not all the same Horizon Construction  Remodeling gets 5 stars This company delivered what was promised Im not affiliated with Horizon in any capacity Im a customer who hired them to remodel my bathroom after calling 5 other contractors who either didnt show up or quoted ridiculous bids Mark who owns the company with his wife Enna gave me a quote that was right about middle range He paid attention to my vision and when I asked  his opinion he had great ideas but was never forceful He was also right up front about everythingnothing hidden After I decided to sign the contract I was still somewhat skeptical Bathrooms and kitchens are multiphase projects and things can go south quickly Id already heard all the nightmares about hiring the wrong contractor By day 2 I noticed that Mark also my project manager stayed on top of every detail so I stopped stressing All the crews he sent for each phase were skilled knowledgable and cleaned up afterwards I got the impression this company only uses competent crews who produce quality workmanship No problems communicating either Mark was always available Another thing hes organized and kept the project moving forward The staff appeared to be organized as well Im thrilled with the appearance and function of my new bathroomits gorgeous It turned out much better than I had expected  If I have another remodel project in the future I wont hesitate to hire them again Thank you so much Mark Enna Grace Anna Maria and staff
4,We had a great experience with David Eskin on the remodel of our kitchen and floors in 2019 Work was completed on time and his workers were outstanding  Four months after completion there was a problem with the grout cracking along the kitchen counter and David promptly sent his tile guy out to redo the cracking grout  Now four months later the problem occurred again David promptly responded again and this time they used a flexible material that matched the grout perfectly  In my experience Horizon Construction stands by their work and has responded quickly to my concerns even after the project was completed
5,I hired Mark Besnos and Enna of Horizon Construction and Remodeling in the spring of 2019 to do a complete kitchen remodel which included removing a load bearing wall and removing a gas fireplace  The actual construction began with the demolition in midJuly and the job was completed the last week of October I had a great experience overall despite the usual stresses of a home remodeling project and living in the house during construction Mark listened to my ideas and concerns and he helped me bring the beach cottage home of my dreams to fruition He was very knowledgeable and gave me great advice on every aspect of the project Mark and Enna invited me to their showroom in Fullerton and showed me a wide variety of materials flooring tile Quartz cabinetry etc to choose from  I appreciated Marks attention to detail thorough explanation of our contract extensive resources and consistent open communication Mark was the project manager for my remodel and he was onsite regularly to oversee his crew I always felt as though my project was Mark and Ennas top priority Any time I had a question or concern Mark andor Enna promptly took my call or immediately called me back Mark was committed to keeping the project on schedule as much as possible even when unforeseen delays occurred due to materials being held up He always had a plan B to keep things moving All of his crew members were very reliable courteous and dedicated Many of his crew members even came to my house on weekends I am extremely happy with my new improved expansive kitchen living and dining room I absolutely love it A huge Thank You to Mark Enna the incredible office staff Genesis and Vanessa and to all of the skilled craftsmen at Horizon for creating a beautiful home for my family
5,"Horizon construction and Remodeling did a major kitchen remodel for us including removal of walls fireplace and reconstruct a large portion of our ceiling  They literally transformed our kitchen  
After checking out many others we decided to choose Horizon Construction and Remodeling because of all the great reviews  After meeting the staff our project manager David Eskin and reading all the positive reviews we knew we made the right decision  The staff is wonderful  Very caring respectful and honest  Our kitchen turned out  beautiful  We are very happy with the outcome

Demolition was right on schedule and the crew was excellent very fast and left the job neat at the end of the day We did however encounter a set back which caused a long pause after demolition  This lengthened the job quite a bit and added additional expense and inconvenience we feel could have been avoided with a more through inspection predemo 
All the staff at Horizon are great to work with  David our project manager is terrific  He is easy to work with and very helpful  He provided suggestions that were very helpful and added to the beauty of our job  There were times he could have lost his patience because of my indecisiveness but never once did  Hes a true gentleman
Caesar our cabinet maker is a master at his trade  We love his work and are so pleased with our cabinets
Something notable that you may not find in many other constructions companies  With Horizon once the project ends they treat you with the same kindness as the day you signed the contract  

This company shines in Customer satisfaction"

5,Our goal was to remodel the kitchen guest bathroom and flooring of our home This is the very first time my wife and I have ever took on a major remodel project It was important to have a contractor that was honest  responsive and did quality work within our budget Since my wife and I work and are extremely busy with our kids it was also important that we have project manager that would communicate with us and closely monitor the people working on our home regarding quality We met with Eitan project manager for Horizon Construction  and he took the time to understand that these qualities were important to us He was also very honest about the project and did not overpromise just to earn our business Eitan and his company made sure we knew they wanted to do whats best for us and immediately we felt confident Horizon was fit for the job His crews were very professional and would answer our questions and always cleaned up when they left for the day Of course there were some hiccups during the project such as the fridge not fitting in the space and some kitchen cabinets needing to be moved around and adjusted In the end the things we requested got fixed and Eitan made sure we were happy I would recommend Horizon to those that see the value of a project manager Overall the quality was good for our budget and I would rate Horizon a 47 out of 5
5,I has Horizon Construction  Remodeling out to do a bid to remodel a guest and master bathroom because of their high rating on Angies list  An appointment was made and David Eskin showed up right on time  He gave me a detailed bid right on the spot in writing  Horizon did each bathroom separately so I could always have a usable shower  I had already picked out most finishes before I got bids  However after the backsplash I had picked out was installed I hated it  David was great and said they would redo it no problem with whatever alternative tile I picked  There were some issues throughout the process that came up but I really appreciated that David and his subcontractors always came up with a solution  The final products are beautiful  Now I have 2 spalike bathrooms with modern finishes that Im thrilled to show off
5,"We contracted Horizon Remodeling to remodel our fireplace and paint our kitchen family room living room and hallway  Eitan Beznos managed the project and was extremely conscientious making sure all work was done correctly and completed as promised  He met with us frequently to check progress and make sure work was done to our satisfaction  When we asked for additional electrical work he arranged for an excellent electrician named Tomer who did a fantastic job for us
We would recommend Horizon Remodeling  Work was well done and finished earlier than promised"
5,"Horizon completed a 450 square foot addition on our house that included moving an exterior wall and reworking the roof line to add a bathroom and expand three bedrooms  This project took place from July 2019 to November 2019  Our primary criteria for selecting a construction company was familiarity with working with our city timeliness and quality of work  performed

We are very happy with the final product of this project  The finished work provided by Horizon Construction is beautiful and works well within our high end home The craftsmen used for the detail work were top notch and the projects that needed to match existing finishes in the house look nearly flawless in their integration  We did not have any problems with permitting the plans or with passing the inspections with the city so there were no hold ups time wise because of inspection issues

When any hiccups did occur as they occur in any remodel or home project Horizon was very quick to correct them to the best of their ability or propose solutions that would result in the same high end product we were looking for  The customer service provided was quite good

David is a great project manager and was very attentive He made sure any and all concerns were addressed promptly and that questions were answered in a very timely manner  He was great about working with me in regards to our timeline and making the process of living through the project as painless as possible

In short I am quite happy that we chose Horizon Construction for our addition project and would absolutely recommend them"
5,"I decided to do a complete bathroom remodel and after meeting with several contractors I decided on Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc I am very happy with my overall experience My bathrooms look absolutely beautiful Horizon gutted both bathrooms and replaced everything with new white porcelain tile sparkling mosaic panels and backsplash sturdy glass doors chrome trims and all new fixtures They painted both bathrooms light grey with white trims and replaced the laminate floors with light grey toned tile I love the results and I am glad I decided to do business with Horizon

I also had a great experience with Horizons customer service They provide excellent service Everyone I spoke with demolition crew plumber office staff contractor owner was professional competent and courteous Initially I was in constant contact with contractor David Eskin He was punctual knowledgeable and professional In the second half of the project I was in constant contact with Enna She was professional knowledgeable and very attentive to my requests Whenever I had a question or concern I could text her and she would respond within minutes That was important to me and I appreciated the expediency Based on my customer experience with Enna I can say she cares a lot about the reputation of the company and delivering great customer satisfaction The project is now complete and thanks to Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc I have two beautiful bathrooms"
5,My wife and I have added a master bathroom and walk in closet as well as adding a new linen closet and floors throughout the house with Horizon Construction We are so happy with the outcome and how our project manager answered any questions we had along the way We feel confident that if any issues pop up in the future that we can call and they will send someone out to correct We have referred Horizon to our friends and will recommend them in the future as we are so happy with the outcome of our house
5,I contacted Houzz to search for a contractor to remodel our two small bathrooms  I did not know where to start  They put me in touch with Horizon and within a couple of days I was meeting with Eitan Beznos their bathroom specialist What impressed me most about Eitan was his friendliness and his desire to look after my every remodeling need He was up front with the cost and the time it would take to complete both bathrooms He recommended the best place to shop for tile and bathroom fixtures He even took me shopping to look for vanities and helped me choose the size and design I was looking for  Once the work was started the project crew became extended family coming and going as needed I was contacted almost daily by Eitan or Genesis Millan from the office to make sure I knew what was the plan for the day  There were inspections at each stage of the project  and we still came in under the original time frame given  I am so pleased with the  professionalism of the everyone who was a part of the remodel the quality of the workmanship and the beauty of both bathrooms
5,"We are very pleased with the way our fireplace wall looks 
Each phase of the project was done by workers who were skilled and experienced 
They did their job quickly and always made sure the room was kept clean
The project was unique and changes the appearance of the whole room 
We would recommend David Eskin our project manager and Horizon Construction  Remodeling Inc to anyone thinking of Remodeling any room in their house"
5,"My wife Kathy and I back in late July contacted three contractors to provide us an estimate to remodel our bathrooms toilet and shower area  Eitan Beznos provided us what we felt was the estimate and help  For this remodel we were under somewhat of a time constraint to try and complete the project by 93  
Eitans crew started demolition as promised on the day as promised  Eitan had Ron and George come in for the rough framing electrical and plumbing which was completed within the first week along with the Hot Mopping  Ron and George and the hot mop person did an incredible job completing on schedule or even ahead of schedule
The main impact to the remodel was from the city inspection crew  While we were delayed a week before we could tile the shower and the floor Eitan and Ron had their tiling crew work the Labor Day Weekend to try and catch up which again we were held up for city inspection Further delaying completion  George came in to perform the finish work even coming in late in the day I am sure after putting in a full day on another job  The custom shower doors that have been installed are beautiful 
We have had numerous construction jobs performed over the years pool installation patio install room additions etc and Eitan was always available either by phone or coming by to check and everyone who worked on the remodel was friendly professional always cleaned up and tried to help minimalize the impact of dust smell and noise as much as possible
I will definitely look to Horizon for any further work"
5,"I met with David Eskin from Horizon Construction he was very friendly and professional  We discussed the projected and my expectations  Within a few days David had the estimate ready and we met for a second time  When we met to review the proposal David went through everything in detail  

A few days later I called David and told him that I would like Horizon to be the contractor for my project  We then agreed on a starting date  I told David I would be out of the country during the beginning phases of the project  He assured me that wouldnt be a problem and would keep me posted throughout the process  

I really enjoyed going to their showroom to pick out the materials for the project I felt like a kid in a candy store  David was there through that process as well and offered suggestions if asked  

Everything went smoothly for the most part throughout the process  Some issues came up regarding the electrical panel this was no fault of Davids and he was quick to resolve the issues  David was always quick to respond to my text messages or emails to address any questions or concerns I might have had  

For the most part the project came out better than anticipated  Everyone who was involved with this project was always kind courteous and eager to assist  

Thank you Horizon

5,"We were very happy with the work done by Horizon
Construction on our remodeling project We love our 1954
suburban home but the two bathrooms were in serious need
of updating Horizon started work and we immediately knew
we were in good hands The workmanship on the floor and
shower tile was superb In our master bath we had custom tiles
installed in the shampoo shelf that made our shower really
shine The workers in charge of painting vanity installation
and plumbing were very friendly and professional We felt
very comfortable having them in our house They answered
questions and communicated their progress to us The overall
job was done in a timely manner and we were always informed
of any delays
David the project manager kept us updated throughout the
entire process and helped us to realize our vision of a
southwestern style guest bathroom He took care of all the
paperwork with our citys permit process We were given
notice of any delays and he responded to texts immediately
On one occasion while we were shopping for vanities at a local
warehouse he texted with us for over half an hour to make
sure we got the right one Halfway through the project we
decided to repipe our entire house and David made that
happen His plumbing crew had the repipe done in two days
We feel confident recommending Horizon for your remodeling
needs They respected our house and it showed in their work
We cant wait to show off our new bathrooms to friends and
family"
5,"We wanted to remodel for a long time  Had interviewed several contractors We didnt know anyone here  When we met David from Horizon we felt safe He understood our vision and helped us clarify it We liked that Horizon is 1 stop destination with a showroom this is truly helpful in this process We chose David Eskin with Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc to and it turned beautiful We Loved All horizon workers  We had few communication glitches but those were resolved right away David did a great job keeping his cool and listening to all our questions and concerns and was on top of it right away ready to explain and resolve 
My only feedback will be in this area  to try and explain the clients more so less questions will arise 
Overall we are very satified with our new kitchen and 2 new bathrooms and recommend Horizon construction and remodeling in Fullerton CA 
to others "
5,"I contracted Horizon to do a remodel of a portion of the house that converted an old bedroom and masterbathroom into a modern master with a large bedroom and guest bathroom The initial budget was doubled what was targeted due to many unexpected expenses some due to my request others due to lack of foresight in planning

The workmanship was of good quality generally but there were areas where attention to detail was not taken 

The customer service has been the best part of working with Horizon When problems arose with plumbing down the line the company was responsive and helped fix the issue and even help with one that was due to the fixtures They also did not charge for small minor requests swapping faucet on an unrelated portion of the house

Overall I would say that the experience is positive"
5,"Horizon Construction recently completed a fireplace remodel in my home  This was our first attempt at any major work here  They were very professional and did a great job  There were times when they had to work around my schedule and times when workers remained until evening to finish a project  
I appreciate the prompt responses I received from Mike and the office staff when I had questions He made good suggestions and had explanations about the process  As in another review the cost was significant for a onewall redo but Im very happy with the result  
Theres a small adjustment needed in the recessed lighting but Im confident this will be finished soon  Overall I think they were professional and easy to work with"
5,"While searching for a quartz counter top to coordinate with my existing beige flooring I discovered Horizon  They had what I wanted and secured a backsplash with a mosaic to complete the color scheme Mark is a hands on contractorowner   He oversees every step of the job and there is little down time in the process  The workers willingly try to accommodate customer requests  If an installation is not satisfactory it is corrected  Horizon does an excellent job for the price charged 

Arlene Hoskins"
4,"After poor experiences with previous contractors we came into our next home repair project with reservations and a long checklist of characteristics we wanted in our next contractors including responsiveness professionalism expertise and followthrough  Horizon was one of the half dozen businesses we solicited

If cost was the only factor Horizon would not have been selected  While the company provided discounts its estimate was triple the lowest bid and thousands more than another contractor we were considering

We met Rey and Omri and we were impressed with the way they addressed our concerns and exuded pride in the companys reputation for high customer service and satisfaction

We got what we paid for
 Jobs were completed as scheduled or there was sufficient communication and transparency during the few times complications arose
 Horizon was responsive both in its communication and followthrough with requests
 Workmanship and attention to detail was excellent
 The company handled minor incidental items without charging us extra
 Half a year later we contacted the business about a warranty issue   The company was prompt in its response and the problem was fixed within a few days

It is evident Horizon values maintaining positive relations with its customers  If price is not the sole determinant we recommend the company and will continue to keep it at the top of our list for future remodeling projects"
5,I bought a house last year and worked with David to remodel the kitchen master bathroom and guest bathroom David was professional and had great design ideas He designed the layouts and helped me selecting the materials for the kitchen and the bathrooms The transformation was amazing The open floor plan between the kitchen and the family room makes the house looks incredible expansive The projects were finished on time and passed all the inspections The final results were exactly as my vision of my house should be
4,As is common with many construction projects we experienced several issues and it took longer than originally planned However David and Mark addressed and corrected all issues even ripping out and starting over on several items when necessary Despite the issues and timing delays Horizon did come in on budget and we absolutely love the new bathrooms and bedroom floor
5,Horizon construction built a bathroom for me in my detached recreational space The room was transformed from a simple and basic recreational room into a livable and enjoyable space that is perfect for single travels or couples looking to stay in a comfy and welcoming space while visiting our lovely state of California David and his construction team finished the job in just over a month on budget and on time I would recommend Horizon construction to others looking room additions or things similar to what we had done to our home
5,"I found Horizon Construction on the Houzz app after several attempts to connect with a few other contractors I sent an email on a Sunday and got a response the following Monday The great communication with Horizon continued through my entire project of a complete remodel of my kitchen guest bathroom and walk in closet They also installed all new windows and tile flooring My project manager was David and he was the best made himself available to me for all of my many questions and decisions even while he was on vacation Working with Enna and the others at the office were perfect as well I couldnt be more pleased with the outcome of my remodel 

Best Regards
Debbie Karmelich"
5,Thank you Horizon for all your help making our guestadditional bathroom for my mother who recently moved in with us a place she loves  David was very kind and understanding of what we wanted and the crews that came to work were very professional  We look forward to having additional work done in our house by Horizon so all of our rooms can be just as beautiful
5,"Horizon did a terrific job on a complete makeover of our master bathroom including the shower jacuzzi flooring countertops sinks and cabinetry and the replacement of all kitchen cabinetry drawers and sink  This was a big project for us  so it was important to select a contractor who was reliable had all the right skill sets and was committed to quality  Horizon delivered on all fronts with flying colors

We found Horizon through Angies List  After reading comments on Angies List and on many other web sites such as BBB and Yelp we decided to get estimates from Horizon and three other service providers   After our initial interview with each prospective provider we concluded that Horizon provided the most comprehensive services at pricing that was very competitive    

Our project involved a variety of skillsets including woodworking plumbing electrical tile installation fabrication and cutting of countertop surfaces and finishing and painting  Rather than hiring a jackofall trades Horizon delivered highly skilled craftsmen in each field who completely embraced Horizons expectations for quality

Our Horizon project manager David was instrumental to the success of our project  David did a great job coordinating and supervising the work of each of the craftsmen  David was very responsive and easy to reach when questions arose  David was on site regularly to inspect progress and assure that the craftsmen met Horizons high expectations for quality  On occasions when David noted items requiring special attention the craftsmen were eager to respond  David was also very responsive and attentive to all observations we shared as the project progressed  It was clear that the craftsmen all shared Horizons deep commitment to quality  The craftsmen were also very courteous and productive throughout the duration of our project  

We are very pleased with the endproduct and the process Horizon followed from start to finish including design suggestions and assistance with surface material selections  Thank you very much to all of the Horizon project team including the backoffice team for a job well done 

We wholeheartedly recommend using Horizon and will most certainly use Horizon for any projects we undertake in the future"
5,Originally written about 35 months after job completion  I must admit that we were highly cautious with our next bathroom remodel hire Reason being was a previous contractor abandoned our master bathroom remodel after attempts to have them address valid concerns That other contractors license was eventually suspended after multiple consumer complaints were filed Thankfully working with Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc on addressing a previous contractors mess ups and then completing a redo of another bathroom in our home was a much better experience The new remodel job that was Horizons from start to finish was completed in a timely manner With our older house there were issues uncovered after the demo process that were not too much of a surprise The issue extended our timeline and did add somewhat minor costs to the job When questions or concerns were raised Mike Roppo our project leader was responsive to address issues and provide explanations before the job moved forward I must state that some of the worksite conditions at the end of a couple jobs were not ideal For example white residue was left on our hedges and some of our walkway from workers mixing materials  possibly grout Also workers left cigarette butts in our newly installed small rocks landscaping that couldnt just get swept out easily Workers did clean up nicely for all interior jobs Finally after completion of both bathrooms two more events occurred First Horizon came out and made repairs that surfaced like settling cracks in the grout for example This was part of their contract but it was done in a timely fashion Second Horizon was helpful with our complaint to the contractor license board by providing a statement of the condition of the bathroom remodel that was abandoned Overall we would include Horizon on our list of contractors to work with again
5,"Sounds corny but it is true  When you deal with Horizon Construction  remodeling you are treated like family 
Its my last major project and I have been putting it off for many years Life happened and it is never the right time to remodel But we are glad we finally did it
 They are very patient people and never made me feel indecisive despite the fact that I am I doubt there are many firms in the entire country that are genial and comfortable and just plain nice Also they explain everything in as much or as little detail as you want and all those details are laid out in an organized and thorough fashion Everyone there is super professional They are a treasure
Love my new house 
Thank you Horizon Construction and remodeling"
5,We were impressed with everyone we interacted with at Horizon especially our contact person named Mike  They finished the project before estimated time and there were no extra charges for anything  We would recommend this company to our family and friends
5,Frequently a home renovation is not for the faintofheart There are countless general contractors to choose from some firstrate and some unscrupulous and which one to hire is often the biggest unknown factor in a successful execution of transforming an idea into fruition In my case I could not be happier Mark Besnos his wife Enna and all the team at Horizon were absolutely the best Having done many a previous renovation on properties over the years I can truthfully say that Marks diligence and demand for perfection overseeing my project is something Ive seldom witnessed before He is more than a simple hammer and nails contractor Mark is a symbiosis of one part architectural engineer with the aesthetic eye of an interior designer With his immense help we were able to harmoniously blend the various colors of granite travertine tile cabinetry and backsplash updating a tired midcentury ranch home kitchen into a Tuscan showplace
1,Horizon Construction  Remodeling in 2018 lied about getting City inspections done damaged my home and covered up the damage and left dangerous conditions throughout my home leaving myself and my family at risk For example just some of the things Inspectors found sharp roof shingles unattached on my roof which could have fallen and cut us they left exposed electrical wiring in the attic  potential fire danger extremely hot pipes not insulated which could have burnt us and more The City is making me remove construction Horizon did because they lied about getting approval DO NOT HIRE THEM They are a dangerous company They also gave a portion of the remodel to another general contractor not as a subcontractor without my approval  Horizon Construction Mark Besnos did not supervise this other contractor whos license has been suspended and is being prosecuted by the California Attorney Generals Office All of this can be confirmed  This was a big project and Horizon Construction  Remodeling took my money and have left my entire family devastated by the amount of damage they did to our home
5,"We just completed our remodel of two bathrooms with Horizon Construction We are very happy with the final product The work was completed on a timely basis with great communication regarding scheduling problem solving and attention to any issues that came up We did have a few issues that needed some attention but they were completed to our satisfaction I was very nervous when we first started the project because I am very detail oriented and was afraid the work  might not meet our expectations but it most certainly does 

David was our project manager and always responded back to any issues that came up on a very timely basis always available via phone or email even on weekends The office staff was equally responsive and that made this project so much easier to deal with 

We did have a little delay due to the rainy weather over the last couple of months but other than that someone was here working pretty much every day since our project started the first week of January  

 Very happy with our choice of Horizon and highly recommend them for your remodeling needs"
5,"We chose Horizon Construction  Remodeling for our project    They are a family owned business that provides outstanding customer service  Our project was a kitchen and living room remodel  Our home was built in the early 50s with the center piece of the home being an indoor barbque taking up most of one wall of a very small kitchen and a massive fireplace in the living room  After weeks of delays and concerns from the city an engineer and architect from Horizon were brought in to help finalize plans  The final decision was to remove the massive brick structure  The kitchen and living room were gutted fireplace and barbeque demolished and a new wall was constructed   We especially liked that everything we needed was on display at their showroom and the staff was extremely patient and helpful as we make our choices  Throughout the remodel our project manager David and the office staff kept us informed as to what was happening and who was coming to work the next day  Each day the crew working cleaned up and did not leave a mess  David Enna Genesis and the office staff were always very professional and constantly checking as to how we were doing since we stayed in the home throughout the remodel  We are extremely pleased with the job done for us by Horizon Construction Remodeling and we highly recommend them
Rick and Sandy Lewis"
5,The team at Horizon Construction  Remodeling has given us the master suite of our dreams My wife and I love our midcentury house but the master bathroom left a lot to be desired Our project manager Mike helped us maximize the space by borrowing from a largely unused kitchenette area and was able to include every single one of the custom cabinets appliances and fixtures we set our hearts on Now we have a luxurious spacious bathroom and a lovely bar area with plenty of storage that will be excellent for entertaining guests Although there are always some complications in a remodel this large the whole process went very smoothly and Horizon took care of us at every step  we were always left feeling our home was in the best hands Thank you so much for helping us fall in love with our house all over again
5,From the very first phone call I made to Horizon I felt valued as a client The office staff was always kind and helpful Our project manager David was easy to work with and was always responsive to any questions or concerns He stopped by frequently to check the progress throughout the project and kept us informed of the next phase and work scheduling All the tradesmen involved were professional respectful of our home great to talk with and did an excellent job Any remodeling project can be stressful but I believe that the service we received from Horizon made the process as smooth as possible  We love our beautiful new kitchen and bathroom I would highly recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling for any home project and would certainly use them again
5,Mark Besnos and his crew at Horizon Construction and Remodeling did an awesome job on all of my remodel projects in my home I especially like that if there is something that you dont quite like they will fix it for you right away I recommend them because I love how everything turned out and I will use them again for my next project
5,Horizon Construction did an awesome job on our Kitchen Remodel  We put off remodeling for so many years but upon reading all the good reviews on this company we finally decided it was time  The outcome was exactly how I envisioned it  David our project manager as well as everyone in the office were always available to help us with any little or big question or concern  We were always told what to expect at each stage and all the contractors were very professional and always kept the work area clean each evening  All deadlines where met as scheduled and no surprise costs were incurred   Thank You Horizon Construction and Remodeling
5,"I interviewed multiple contractors to complete a full bathroom remodel for 3 bathrooms  I ultimately chose Horizon because I knew they would be the right fit for the project I was undertaking  They are a small family owned business that has the customers satisfaction in the forefront of their minds   We agreed that we would complete the project in two phases  We completed a hall and master bathroom remodel first with the third bathroom to take place after the first of the year  
Both Horizon and their subcontractors are available to answer questions and assist with any decision making you may need or ideas to make your project have an outcome that you are 100 satisfied with  The workmanship timeliness and cleanliness of each subcontractor was impeccable  I would highly recommend Horizon for your next remodel"
4,"I started this bathroom remodel with a different contractor  but it didnt go well So I hired Horizon Construction  Remodeling and my bathroom is absolutely stunning I will recommend them to friends and family David my project manager was great he always assured me that all will be taken care for me and I actually could sleep good at night And I did  Im very happy  
Any questions that come out were addressed in a very timely manner 
Which made me feel very comfortable 
Now the project is complete it looks absolutely wonderful beyond my expectations 
My family and I really love it"
5,I interviewed three contractors and chose Mark Besnos and Horizon for an extensive interior remodel of my home  master bedroom and bath guest bathroom kitchen  The project included removing a soffit ceiling in about half the house installing a new support beam to eliminate a post wainscoting in the living and dining room hardwood flooring in the renovated areas except the bathrooms two new windows and a new fireplace mantel  Mark wasnt the least expensive but based on his experience and our discussion I felt he would be hands on and would provide guidance during the course of the project  Mark has excellent taste  He was patient and worked with me and my cousin who was consulting with me very well  He was earnest in trying to accommodate his visits to my work schedule  A project of this magnitude is bound to encounter some challenges and Mark was good at explaining them and presenting options while giving me time to reflect  The various trades who worked on my home were top notch and when there were some issues Mark immediately took steps to correct fix redo what needed to be done An example is the flooring  There was a haze on the floor and Mark contacted the manufacturer and called in and paid at his expense a professional to inspect the floor and make recommendations  Mark and his team were always on top of things communicating often via email my preference and also texts  The end result has exceeded my expectations  I am thrilled with my new open concept home  The kitchen is amazing the fireplace is a focal point and I absolutely love my master bathroom   We had some fun with the guest bathroom as well  Now I need artwork  Bottom line    if someone leaves me a house in his or her will and I have to remodel it Im calling Mark and Horizon
5,We love Horizon We wanted to do an exterior remodel and contacted them They were there every step of the way and always available when we had questions They were on time and kept to their schedule They constantly kept us updated on the project Mark is greathe listened to what we were thinking and helped make it reality  We really liked that Mark lets you know if there are any problems and helps come up with solutions They take care of their customers  Enna was also amazing and was always available to answer questions We will use them again for our next project
5,Horizon did a wonderful job with our kitchen They were clear communicators all along the way and went the extra mile to accommodate our requests We love our new kitchen
5,"My wife and I made the decision to completely remodel our 55 year old kitchen which included removing a couple of walls to open it up to the dining room and living room After deeply vetting numerous contractors and securing proposals we selected Horizon Construction in Fullerton CA Mark Besnos company owner was by far the most detail oriented and considerate home improvement contractor weve ever worked with Throughout all phases of the project Horizon provided extraordinary workmanship in a very timely manner Of course with any major project there are a few challenges Horizon Construction remedied every issue with effective contingency plans for any problem they encountered  Here is an excellent example of superior service We selected and ordered quartz counter tops from MSI of Orange CA  When the quartz counter tops arrived and were installed they had a number of finishing defects which Horizon tried to repair Unfortunately the defects were irreparable and MSI would not stand behind their product and workmanship Mark and Horizon Construction however alleviated our aggravation by selflessly offering us a partial financial reimbursement even though the counter top finishing was not Horizons responsibility 
From beginning to completion Horizon Construction exhibited professionalism pride of workmanship and a commitment to excellence If you are seeking the finest company to successfully bring your remodeling dreams to reality Horizon Construction is unquestionably the one"
5,"We were referred to Horizon Construction from a neighbor that had recently hired them for a bathroom  kitchen remodel  Although Horizons was quote was higher than previous quotes we went with them based on the quality of workmanship we saw in my neighbors home plus their great online reviews 
The first couple of weeks went well We were told the job would take 45 weeks to complete The first round of workers and inspector were on schedule Around week three things slowed down  The tile guy only worked between 35 hours a day We ran into a couple problems with paint that resulted in doovers  Some of the mistakes made by the painters were somewhat novice However our project manager was quick to respond and correct the issues The job was completed at the end of week five
At the end our experience with Horizon Construction was a great one The office staff and project manager were pleasant and attentive to our concerns  We are happy with the work done in our bathroom and would consider using them again in the future  I highly recommend Horizon Construction to anyone looking to do a remodelconstruction in their home"
5,It went great Enna David and the entire Horizon Group were a pleasure to work with Expectations clearly communicated and met Trades arrived when scheduled on time and prepared The few problems that came up were quickly resolved to our satisfaction We are planning further work next year and will use Horizon Construction and Remodel again We have full confidence that we will be treated as fairly and professionally as we were on this project
5,We contracted with Horizon Construction and Remodeling to remodel all three of our bathrooms  Mark Enna and the administrative staff were fully involved throughout the project providing updates schedule reminders and addressing all of our concerns along the way  While we were upgrading the two upstairs bathrooms we had a family of 5 sharing a downstairs shower  Mark was good about keeping the project moving forward and getting us use of the upstairs bathrooms as soon as possible  During the demo work we uncovered bathtub rust  Mark covered the options and was able to work in the schedule a replacement with a project quick change order  We also decided midflight of the remodel that the existing cabinets were not going to work  Mark once again was able to provide options for us to address within our timeframe and budget  As during any remodel big or small issues and challenges will arise  Mark and the whole Horizon team went out of their way to make sure my wife and I were extremely pleased with the process and end results  We very much appreciated the communication periodic onsite morning meetings and the breakdown of payments spread throughout the 4 month project that allowed us a little more control of the finances  Overall we appreciated the honesty upfront discussions and their dedication to details to make our bathrooms beautiful  We would not hesitate to contract with them again  Thank you Mark Enna and the whole Horizon Construction and Remodel team
5,"I have been wanting to remodel my kitchen for several years and the opportunity finally presented itself
Horizon was recommended to me by my neighbor so I decided to include them in the process of choosing a contractor
All of the contractors provided about the same cost to do the remodel but my final decision went to Horizon 
I choose Horizon to do the job because first impressions do matter and Horizon impressed me with their professional manner and responsiveness 
When the job started I was again pleased with the scheduling and notifications I received from Enna and Genesis Like most people I am a busy person and I like to be informed and prepared Being kept in the loop about the activity at my home was very helpful and appreciated




During the remodel process my home and garage were cleaned up and neat when I arrived home always a welcome sight The kitchen was completed before the scheduled end date which was a great surprise But most of all the kitchen is gorgeous The workmanship is beautiful and the I couldnt be happier with the result I would definitely recommend Horizon to anyone wanting or needing to start a construction project"
5,"We want to thank Horizon Construction  Remodeling Inc 
Especially Enna  David for our BEAUTIFUL  makeover kitchen
They were really helpful in helping us select our cabinets counter tops and backsplash and the color combination for our kitchen
David was great 
He was here and checked each phase of the work and made sure all work was done satisfactory
the workers were great in their preparation and cleaning up before leaving
Thank you again Horizon we are very pleased with the work done"
5,You can feel comfortable hiring Horizon Construction and Remodeling for your next house project  I had to do lots of repair and maintenance on my Queen Anne Victorian home and Project Manager Mike and the folks at Horizon came through with flying colors   I replaced the roof cleaned and reinsulated the attic added new floors upstairs upgraded some electrical repaired plater ceilings and painted the exterior with a three color Painted Lady look for the house  All the subcontractors were polite fine craftsmen and always on time Mike was great communicating  with me at all times  This situation has not always been true for contractors Ive interviewed to work on my house  Usually they come to the house say they will give me an estimate and never call back  Horizon and their team did  high quality work on a difficult older home
5,"Horizon Construction and Remodeling recently remodeled my kitchen and I highly recommend their work  They completed my project on time and on budget

Our project manager Mike was a positive force from beginning to end  Anytime I texted him he answered back right away every time  He was always on top of things and very sensitive to any concerns I might have

The staff at Horizon was also great  They kept me informed every step along the way as to what was going to be done next  Each day after work was completed the workers left the area extremely clean  They never left a mess at any time which I appreciated

It was a remarkably stress free remodel and the results were exactly as I had envisioned  I will definitely use them again for any project in the future"
5,"I chose Horizon to do a complete kitchen remodel add an additional 100 square feet and create a 9 pass through between the kitchen and family room  This entailed major construction  engineering demo footings support beams framing insulation electrical plumbing paint floor tile cabinets countertops and installing appliances  
 
Mark Besnos the owner was the project manager and Enna and Genesis back office provided education and guidance throughout the entire project  The approximate timeline given was three months it was finished in two months  Mark worked with me in building the kitchen in stages to ensure I was able to stay within my budget 
 
Mark made suggestions along the way which I appreciated  I agreed with some and others I didnt  For instance during construction he prompted me to think about raising the ceiling  Im very thankful I agreed with his recommendation  it worked out well  There was never any pressure to do anything I didnt want to do 
 
Communication is always the key to success  I was always aware of the next steps  Whenever I had questions Mark or Enna promptly answered  They even answered questions and concerns while they were on vacation  they are dedicated to their profession There were some small concerns or issues along the way  they were addressed and resolved in a timely manner which was greatly appreciated
 
This has been an educational and rewarding experience  A lot has to do with the relationship established with the client  The Besnos family Mark and Enna from the beginning have been friendly patient honest and trustworthy
 
I now have a beautiful dream kitchen to enjoy with family  Thank you Mark and Enna"
5,The Horizon team did an OUTSTANDING job at my home We had a bathroom remodel which they basically completely redesigned and it looks absolutely amazing So happy with the outcome and service
4,We searched on all popular web sites to look for a recommended contractor  Horizon beat out other companies and we met with Mark the owner  I explained to Mark what we were wanting and looking for  Horizon was very timely and on task  They always kept me in the loop of what I needed to do and what they were going to work on  When I changed some of the design or wanted tile to be redone Mark came right over and addressed the issues  I liked how all of the workers cleaned up after themselves as well All of Horizens employees were professional and friendly Our kitchen looks great and functions so much better  Our kids want to cook too  Thank you Horizon
5,Our dream to remodel our kitchen began a couple of years ago   We interviewed contractors but none worked out or followed up with us   We began to again search in the summer of 2017 and met with Mark of Horizon Construction as well as with other contractors  We were especially impressed when we visited the Horizon  office to see cabinets and other materials  Also we were very impressed by Ena and the staff   Mark had great ideas and helped us design a new kitchen for us Work began in mid November due to our schedule  and progressed well with workers showing up on time almost every day  Work included demolition replacing all cabinets with granite tops and tile backsplash creating an island with a sink which involved moving plumbing widening of the doorway between the kitchen and dinning room enclosure of a preexisting sliding door  new floors in the hallways kitchen and dining rooms and creating a new gas line and venting exhaust for the new range and other electrical upgrades   The work progressed smoothly despite a few bumps in the road  Mark made certain all work was done to his high expectations   Ena and the office staff were always available to answer our questions  Inspections went smooth and quickly   The job was completed on schedule and to our satisfaction   We highly recommend Horizon Construction and will not hesitate to call on them again for future projects
5,The complete remodel of one of our bathrooms was just completed by Horizon Construction last week The bathroom is gorgeous I could not be happier The project manager David was constantly on top of the scheduling and progression of the work He visited almost every day to make sure everything was going to plan and always asked if we had any questions or problems Any issues that came up were immediately addressed Compared to many contractors I have dealt with the communication was wonderful  The quality of the work was top notch and the various tradespeople plumbers electricians painters tilesetters etc were all very pleasant and helpful They were always on time per the schedule or if there was a delay we received a timely email and reschedule time The job was completed on time per the original promise date The clean up at the end of the job was professionally done I would highly recommend Horizon Construction for any remodeling job

5,Great service and professional workers The company contractor and team were prompted on time answered all the questions I had and performed the remodeling project in proficiency Definitely recommended
5,"We met Horizon Construction  Remodeling Representative after meeting 2 other contractors and we must say we liked Horizon a lot
The project manager was very knowledgeable and personable
He listen to us and made good suggestions and was always available for us
we honestly couldnt do this project without him
It took longer than we planned because the remodel was done around the holiday season but it was worth it The END product is beautiful 
We receive many compliments from family  friends
We appreciate the hard work  all workers were very dedicated and talented
We will spread the GOOD WORD ABOUT HORIZON"
5,We love the new bathroom The old bathroom was cramped damp and colored pink the house was build in 1957 The only venting was the window My father requires a full time caregiver and there was barely enough room in the bathroom for one grown man let alone two Mark came up with an excellent floor plan and matched his ideas with our hopes and wishes The bathroom was completely gutted The plumbing for the shower with shower head and hand shower was added and the plumbing for the toilet and the vanity sink was moved Three areas of lighting were addedover the vanity over the toilet and in the shower A combination venting fanlight was installed An additional electrical outlet was installed The bathroom window was replaced Floor to ceiling tile was installed for the shower as was a channel drain the shower is 8 feet wide The project was finished not only on time but 12 days early The entry into the bathroom and the new shower can now accommodate a person in a wheelchair Not only is it functional its beautiful in its modern palette of neutral grays tans and creams All work was professionally done and supervised by Mark After the project was completed Mark and Enna called to follow up When there was an issue with the shower not draining I made one call and Marks workers were out the next morning to fix it This was my first remodel project and on a whole it much better than I had hoped it could be We are very satisfied and will be hiring Horizon for future projects
5,We chose Horizon to refresh the exterior of our home based upon the good ratings in Angies List and Houzz  They were very prompt in setting a time to meet with us  Leo listened very well to what we wanted to have done and then he walked us through how they would go about getting the job done  He detailed for us the many steps they would go through to prepare for the work that would need to be done for removing old facade adding new stucco painting adding stone veneer and replacing patio fence  He explained some of the extra steps they do that others skip which are important for a longlasting result  Leo laid out for us the expected start time and timeline for completion  Based upon some other estimates that I had received Horizons cost estimate was very reasonable  Their backoffice staff was also very helpful to us in selecting the materials to be used on the job and working with us on scheduling  Once the job got started it progressed according to plan and all city inspections were completed timely without need for any change to the work they had done  The job was completed to our satisfaction on time and on budget they even did a few extra addons without charging us anything extra  Job well done thankyou
5,"Thank you

Horizon did a great job with my room addition with bathroom and patio  Now I have a great guest room for when my friends and family come to visit 

I now start my day on my new patio enjoying my coffee in the shade  Mike the project manager was wonderful to work with   He was helpful in helping me designing both the interior and exterior layout  He had a lot of great suggestions and was very knowledgeable

I will not hesitate to call upon them for any additional work in the future"
5,"Mark and Enna were fantastic  Mark has an excellent understanding of construction and the realities of renovating a home  His recommendations reflect his extensive experience and his artistic flare  We found that by listening to him his ideas proved to be a better fit than our original ideas  We are so very glad that we took his advice especially regarding our kitchen remodel  Horizon has an entire showroom of materials and other construction examples at their Fullerton location  This made the selection of materials extremely convenient  We also found that their material options were of very good quality  We love the backsplash that we picked out in our kitchen

When we first met Mark he was 5 minutes early to our appointment  Everyone we dealt with after the initial meeting was either early or exactly on time  We never had to wait for anyone  When a repair was needed or a concern arose Enna resolved the matter very quickly sometimes within the hour  They were very up front about what was being done and they stayed on budget  We moved out of our house for 2 months and they had us back in exactly on schedule  No surprises  Our home was very outdated and needed some serious attention and that is exactly what we got  We would hire Horizon Construction and Remodeling again without question"
5,In October 2018 I met with Mike Project Manager from Horizon Construction to do a basic kitchen  wet bar remodel  He was very easy to work with and explained the process very clearly Horizon replaced all my cabinets installed new granite counter tops backsplash sinks and faucets and painted the room This was to be completed in 4 weeks but ended up taking a little over 5 weeks as there were issues with some cabinets backsplash and minor electrical problems Every concern or even complaint I voiced was immediately addressed and corrected They all are focused on providing excellent customer service and making sure their clients are satisfied Enna owner contacted me recently to ask if there was anything else I needed and this was a month after completion Cost of the project was within the budget I had allowed and felt their costs are reasonable and competitive Even with the extra week to complete the project the result is a beautiful new kitchen island and wet bar I may be remodeling another room and would hire Horizon Construction again as their concern for customer satisfaction stands out
5,"Work was done in a timely fashion and the quality was excellent Each stage of the project was 
managed well all workers were punctual and did a good job of cleaning up after work was done Work 
was completed ahead of schedule and we were very happy with the final results"
4,"Project Repipe whole house and install tankless water heater replace ducts and install new ACFurnace unit remodel two bathrooms

After speaking to three general construction companies we decided to hire Horizon Construction for our projects Their prices were reasonable as compared to the other companies and we appreciated the detailed written scope of the project that they provided to us Mark Enna and their office staff were very pleasant to work with they also have a very nice showroom

Overall we are happy with how our projects turned out Enna is great with communications She always replied to our messages promptly to address our issues and concerns We did have various issues with the workmanship and cleanliness of some of the trades that came to do the work which made us felt that the project manager was not always attentive to what was being done at our house We had to clean up a lot of the messes that were left every night when came home Horizon could definitely benefit as a company if they improve their ability to oversee a project more closely to ensure that things are being done properly by their subcontractors But in general Mark and Enna do care about the satisfaction of their customers They are committed to making things right They always made sure that we were happy with the end result We never felt like Enna or Mark would just ignore us or our concerns For this reason alone we would recommend their company to others"
5,"We loved the fact Horizon had a nice showroom where we could find everything we liked It made all decision process much easier for us 
Mark Besnos did excellent job he planned everything very well The communication was great and easy Enna Eskin was helpful at office and over emails We love our new kitchen it is just like we imagined even better  This is now a perfect summer house for our big family 
Thank you Horizon "
5,"Well I wish I had something fun and exciting like a room addition or kitchen remodel to talk about but our project was just a boring complicated extensive repairrenovation For more than a decade every time we had a major storm we got flooding in our family room and every time we thought we had fixed the problem when the next storm came the water reappeared We talked to several contractors and they all had pretty much the same opinion Since we couldnt figure our the source or sources of the leaking the only way to fix it for sure would be to completely remove and replace the stucco and paper from the rear of the house and replace all the windows This would also involve detaching and disassembling a large wood patio cover and then putting it back together One contractor didnt even want to take the job

We chose Horizon due to a high recommendation from my brother who had used them for a kitchen remodel The estimate and bid process was quick and smooth and communication and scheduling with Enna and the office was great throughout Mark was quick to address the problems which were many due to the fact that as it turned out our leaks were coming from more than one source

The quality of the work for the most part was excellent In fact the building inspector commented that the workmanship of the wrapping job was the best he had ever seen My only complaint is that the work of the window installers was less than stellar but allinall  the final outcome was good The color and texture of the stucco also perfectly matches the rest of the house

We did a water test and all looks good We wont know for sure until the next big storm but Im confident that well have a dry family room so confident In fact that we just installed new carpet"
5,Mark and team just finished giving our old house a face lift Outstanding job Mark gave us some great advice on how make the house look its best His inputopinions matched our taste Marks attention to details and the quality of the work ensured the outcome was to our satisfaction We would definitely recommend them and use them again on our next project New garage doors are on order
5,"After talking to several contractors we reached out to Horizon Construction for a bid Mark came out to our house to discuss our project After talking a while Mark gave suggestions for changes to the blue prints It took 7 months with our previous contractorarchitect to get the changes made but they were unquestionably worth the wait Once we had approval from the city Mark worked us into their busy schedule right away Mark and his crew worked every day to get our project finished in the timeline they gave us 
Like most projects there were setbacks budget changes and other bumps in the road However Mark and his team worked really hard They did a great job scheduling inspections to keep the job moving All of the budget changes were because of things we wanted or added not because of his incorrect bid When issues arose his office staff was great at contacting us communicating via phone and email and answered questions quickly 
Mark and Enna were a joy to work with they were punctual professional offered good ideas and allowed us to do some of the work ourselves Mark is very particular in the way he expects the work to look he treats his projects likes it is his own place Mark and Enna always worked diligently to be sure we were happy with the products and services they provided Despite skepticism from friends and neighbors Mark was done a few days early 
We would definitely recommend Horizon Construction to any of our family and friends"
1,"The owner is stuck up and rude Says hes the owner and is taking his time to come give us an estimate Says he doesnt do small things and looked like he didnt want to be at our house wasting his precious time The way he talked and acted throughout the process made me feel like our job was too small for him and we were wasting his time When I called to book my appointment for a consultation I was very specific twice about what I needed to be done and asked if our job was too small and the person who setup my appointment said their smallest job was 10k So he should have already know the job details prior to coming But when the owner showed up and realized we were small to him he didnt seemed like he wanted to waste his time on us He quoted me 47k for doing my yard which I had bids from other contractors and the highest bid was 15k I told him that and he replied that he will hire and attorney and open escrow with 10k and said if I can find someone to do the job for 15k he will give me 10k and if not I need to give him 5k What he said was unbelievable I said Im not going to waste your time anymore and he said EXACTLY and left On their website it says we are your friendly contractor and want to make it a delightful experience for our customers  Well our experience wasnt really delightful and the owner wasnt really friendly Maybe if I had a million dollar home for him to remodel and the job was hundred of thousands he wouldve acted and talked differently because he did mention he was working on a 200k pool in Palos Verdes for a 15million home Its fine if you dont work on small jobs but tell your customers ahead of time instead of coming into their home with no common courtesy

Thank you for your reply We did hire someone to do the job But its not the price Im talking about that is wrong with your company Im talking about your owners attitude when he came to my house I think he should at least apologize for that instead of trying to write a response to this review to prove that there was nothing wrong with his attitude and the way he talked to a potential customer I dont appreciate it someone that I asked to come give me an estimate to act like the way he did Thank you for wishing me good luck because I do feel the luckiest part was to not hire your company for the job"
5,We did our research Horizon construction company was great The workmanship was beyond our expectations Our kitchen turned out better then what we thought possible If youre searching for a construction company for any remodel give them a call you will not be disappointed Thanks to Mike our contractor he listened to us and gave us great advise  They even supported us with fixes after the warranty period just awesome
4,"We were looking around to get a kitchen and bathroom remodel We met with several contractors but really liked Mike He was professional knowledgeable and we liked his design ideas and the quote 

We ran into unexpected delays from the beginning and that set our timeline back out the gate asbestos abatement However when the project got moving it took off well 
There were some other bumps in road that caused delays as well most were unexpected 

Overall we give a four star rating  Certain aspects of the process were great and others were lacking 
The office staff was great and tried to be helpful and accommodating We had been lead to believe that we would have a working toilet and work would be done around it since we only have one bathroom We had made arrangements for the first few weeks and as we got closer to thanksgiving week and we were aware that little work would be done it became a problem  Enna made it work and got the flooring laid and the toilet connected before the holiday 

The downfall of the process was either scheduling or communication or something  When we made a change no matter how big or small time was added to the timeline Although technically they finished within the timeline there were days on days on days where little or nothing happened One day someone came for all of fifteen minutes and then nothing for a week  We had all the rooms painted and we have never known painting to take so long The plumber was great The electrician was great the framer was great  They all cleaned up well at the end of the day and the few times it wasnt quite right Mike was on it and had it taken care of 
 
Overall we are happy with the end result and would hire Horizon again"
5,"Horizon Construction was such a lucky find for me I inherited a house from my parents on Balboa Island that was built in 1933 As my parents aged there was a lot of deferred maintenance that needed to be addressed I had several contractors come and give me estimates and advice but no one took the time like Mike of Horizon Construction did to really find out what I wanted to do and give me realistic quotes He was able to preserve the charm and character that the house had while making it safe and clean with modern amenities It was a long 8 months project but in that time the quality and care was always there and my wishes were foremost  I am happy to give the folks at Horizon Construction Two Thumbs Up and would urge anyone wanting a remodel to contact them

Sincerely
Suzanne S"
5,We are happy with the final results of our remodeled kitchen  Eitan our Project Manager was the best to work with  Thank you very much
4,"Project Kitchen update Replaced tile countertops with granite added backsplash lowered the bar to counter height and expanded the peninsula  Installed new sink induction cook top and downdraft 

Comments After talking with other contractors we chose Horizon Construction who did a nice job with our kitchen update The workers and project manager were timely knowledgeable skilled and neat  The granite looks awesome and the details around the windows were perfect The range and the downdraft fit together just right 

They were fast and completed our project ahead of schedule a nice plus It was important to them that we were totally satisfied and when an issue arose they always had a solution  We would use them for future remodeling projects"
5,Nearly 2 years ago Horizon came out and did a major remodel of our downstairs kitchen living room baseboards  flooring fireplace etc It came out beautifully and we were very happy with the results Recently we were contacted by Horizon again checking to see how we felt about the remodel at this point Well we had a few concerns cracked cabinet door uneven drawers and a crack in the wall where the pantry was installed which I shared with Enna and within 2 days she had someone out at our home repairing everything replacing doors etc for NO CHARGE I am impressed by the customer service of this company its willingness to take care of us so long out from the job was never expected but definitely appreciated
5,"Horizon Construction did a complete  master bath  remodel for me  They did a great job and stayed on schedule  Their attention to detail and finish work was perfect  When  there was a minor  problem Horizon handled it without question  I would highly recommend  and will use them for my next 
remodel needs   
David Sunde"
5,"Horizon Construction  Remodeling and Eitan the project manager were awesome
I had several projects done foundation support stucco fascia boards interior and exterior paint and electrical work 
All were done professionally and perfectly 
When unexpected issues arose they were handled quickly  past expectation 
I would definitely use them again"
5,"Enna Mark and team did a great job with our full kitchen remodel We knocked down two walls did a large support beam and gutted the complete kitchen Mark suggested we move the sink and reprofile the window which turned out to be an excellent suggestion Were very happy with the kitchen and can now entertain without being stuck in a very warm and small box separated from our guests

Enna spent a lot of time with us near the end of the project to make sure we were satisfied and that everything was to our liking"
5,The bathroom is beautiful  It was very stressful and I agonized over each decision  Mike project manager and Robert contractor helped with decisions and obtaining materials  Sol was a great worker  Mike assured me that everything was fixable when I was catastrophizing  I had to remind myself of that many times  Im so glad its over  I would recommend them
5,My husband and I are so fortunate to have found Horizon Construction on the Houzz website to help us with our master bathroom remodel  It was extremely important for us to feel that our contractor was listening paying attention to detail and caring about doing a great job  We got all that in spades in working with Eitan Beznos our lead designercontractor who became a trusted friend through every step of the process  He consistenty monitored the progress and was in contact with us almost daily to ensure we were satisfied with each installation element along the way take action to address any problemsissues update us on whatwhen to expect next and offer helpful advice on lingering decisions to be made  He also even helped find the exact tile from a photo I had shown because he knew it would make us happy not having to settle for something else  Our design concept for the bathroom really came to life and it really is a showstopper  We are amazed at how it looks now and are already planning to contract with Horizon again in a few months for our second bathroom remodel
5,Our small old bathroom was starting to have a lot of issues so we decided a remodel was in order We found Horizon Construction online and decided to request an estimate based on the reviews After our first meeting with Mark we felt comfortable with him and were impressed with professionalism and attention to detail Their showroom office had many displays and samples that it made it easier for visual people like me and my wife to envision our design Our bathroom project had a few twists and turns but Mark was very flexible and committed to customer satisfaction Marks workers were easy to work with and the Horizon Construction staff was kind and willing to help with any questions issues or concerns we had All in all we are happy we got the bigger bathroom we wanted I would definitely recommend Horizon Construction for home remodels
5,"We recently had our master bath remodeled by Horizon Construction  This was our first experience with a remodel contractor and we didnt really know what to expect  In our first meeting with Mark he made several suggestions that we decided to go with such as putting in a light above the tub and adding an electrical outlet on the other side of the sink  

We really appreciated the fact that Horizon had their own showroom and could make suggestions on combinations of tile vanities and counter materials  After going to the big box stores and looking at tile and counter top materials and still not knowing what we wanted we found Marks input invaluable 

The workmen all were very good at their jobs  Steps were taken to protect the floors leading to the bathroom under remodel Trash was removed in a timely manner  

There were lots of items we needed to purchase in the first couple of days so that when the walls were rebuilt accommodations could be made for the water supply drains and electrical  Decisions had to be made along the way and we answered them the same day so as to not cause a delay in the schedule  There were a couple of issues that came up and Horizon addressed them as we went along  

We were so happy with the result that we hesitated to use the bathroom for a couple of days after completion we didnt want to mess it up

Bottom line is we wouldnt hesitate to use Horizon Construction again"
5,I decided to have a load bearing wall removed which sounds a lot easier than it is Horizon was the only company I contacted that didnt waffle on giving me an estimate or insist that I must get more done in order to be taken seriously  The office staff was friendly and engaging without being pushy and sales crazy  I found Eitan Beznos our assigned contractor to be friendly  ethical  receptive and always a calming influence in the midst of the project which  as anyone whos had major construction done  knows can be a real upheaval of a familys daytoday life All the workers involved were pleasant and efficient I was impressed also by the respect and friendliness between the workers and  Eitan  Im very big on customer service and to me a homeowner with a quirky mid century home that needs quite a bit of work I feel like Ive found a reputable company that I can trust and partner with to turn my home into the neighborhood jewel that it can be Im looking forward to having Horizon remodel my kitchen later this year
5,"When i decided to redo my kitchen i was very nervous about who to hire and trust to do the work
Im an older widow with NO experience in all of this 
after quite a few interviews well there was no other choice 
It was HORIZON CONSTRUCTION  REMODELING all the way
Michael R was my project manager and really listened to me and was so helpful in all ways
Robert and his crew was great He was always there for me a giant of a guy in all ways
I couldnt be happier They finished in 9 days
AND the price was reasonable 
It turned out beautiful 
I highly recommend HORIZON

5,I had a bathroom and bedroom remodeled by Horizon They were reasonable on the overall cost when compared to other quotes obtained Eitan Beznos did an excellent job overseeing this project He expressed a sense of care and always wanted to make sure I was pleased with the work before moving on Overall the workmanship was excellent and I was always guided to make the best decision possible on material and installation Their workers were courteous and knowledgeable Horizon left both rooms looking immaculate and ready for me to move back in The end result of this project surpassed my expectations with the project completing on time I highly recommend Horizon for any home project
5,"Horizon Construction did a beautiful job on our remodel  Our our family and friends are raving about the difference between before and after  There so many nice touches that Mark incorporated in the remodel such as the backsplash in the kitchen and including different stone  The crew were professional diligent hard working and
cleaned up after themselves every day  Mark was flexible and willing to work on any issue without any complaint  He is a perfectionist which means he demands high quality from his crew  He was present during all stages of construction and willing to address any concerns promptly  I highly recommend him and his team"
5,Our kitchen and downstairs bathroom in our 30 year old home were beginning to look dated and tired plus we knew if we tore all down wed be able to make better use of the space We hired Horizon Construction after having interviewed three contractors We immediately liked Mark Beznos because of his professionalism and seriousness about providing us with the best possible choices regarding layout and design not to mention that his pricing was reasonable His initial proposal was very detail oriented and assisted us in approaching all aspects of the project with a good understanding of what would take place Marks crews from tear down to installation have been on time and easy to work with Theyre efficient and clean up once they have completed their work Our remodel included not only our kitchen and bathroom but all of the flooring baseboards and crown molding in our family room and living room Its been a huge project and we couldnt be more pleased with the result We have a beautiful modernized downstairs thats worthy of a professional photo shoot
5,I Found Horizon Construction  Remodeling on line actually for another job but had to shift on the fly when a garage repair issue became more pressing  Mark came out and reviewed the job with me onsite and followed up with a quote While not the lowest I got a good vibe from Mark and chose Horizon for the repair which entailed removing the entire garage floor and much of the underlying soil The repair looks great and I have received multiple compliments on the completed work The crews showed up on time and were diligent in their work Mark and his team are very quick to respond to inquiries which is a big deal to me I would use them again without hesitation
5,I had Horizon install cabinets in my laundry area along with a new sink and also install a wet bar and media center in my living room  The quality of the work is excellent and Im extremely happy Although my house is small their work gave it character and everyone that visits comments on how great it looks  Emma kept me informed the whole way and Mark helped me design everything I wanted  Thank you
5,"Were writing this review for Horizon Construction  Remolding Inc because we found them to be a timely conscientious and hardworking company that was easy to work with
The owner Mark Besnos and his staff were very attentive to every detail of our bathroom remodel
All of the crew members that worked on our bathroom were extremely hard working always showed up on time and worked long hours to get the job done
We would highly recommend Horizon Construction for your next construction job

5,My wife and I are delighted  with our new kitchen  Horizon did the remodeling in an expeditious and professional  manner  Their workers were courteous and knowledgeable  We would highly recommend Horizon to anyone contemplating a remodeling  project
5,Horizon Construction completed our remodeling project that involved a full kitchen remodel and structural changes We could not be more pleased with the results Mark Enna and office staff were highly professional and good communication was made a priority by all They accommodated all of our change requests  Mark was mindful that my family was living through the remodel and made efforts to keeping the renovation dust limited to a portion of the house  The stress of the remodel was lightened by Mark and Ennas empathy and care  as parents of young children as well Workers sometimes made errors and small damages to areas such as the flooring and walls Yet with each of these problems Mark would correct them without question or added charges  He also took full responsibility for unanticipated problems with the installation of a custom range hood  In his words I will take care of you  In the end we have a beautiful highend kitchen media room and more functional laundry room and garage
4,"Our first home circa 1951 needed a complete remodel It had barely been maintained for decades and needed new everything  plumbing electrical HVAC flooring windows doors etc We also wanted to update the bathroom update and expand the kitchen and remove a loadbearing wall to create an open concept floor plan

We met with several other shops and none of them could even envision the finished product or give us a complete estimate It was a relief when Mike our contractor said at our first meeting Well the good news is that we can do it all And they did We have been pleased with the overall quality of the work performed particularly given everything that needed to be done The kitchen cabinets which Horizon supplied are particularly high quality We also appreciated that Mike worked with us to develop a clear pricing estimate and that other than two unavoidable change orders the pricing for the job did not change or expand Horizon allowed us to supply many of our own materials to accommodate our budget as well The total price was expensive but fair given the short supply of contractors willing and able to do the whole job We did not have much leverage to negotiate

I give Horizon four stars instead of five because we had some communication and timing issues on the job After we signed the contract in May the permit submission process was delayed nearly 6 weeks and while this can be par for the course in some cities we were not told of the cause for the delay or how the delay was going to impact the project timeline Instead we were told and planned on a completion date in early October and were not told until midSeptember that the work was actually going to be completed in early November We had to scramble to extend our temporary lease and find ways to cover the extra costs in our budget

We also had to push several times for deadlines about what materials needed to be selected and supplied and about payments to be made We asked for a project timeline but never received one and so for several materials we had to scramble in a day or two to supply them when Mike asked for them asap Similarly we offered several times to make progress payments waited several weeks and then were asked for large lump sums to cover multiple payments Both situations caused significant stress

The lack of a timeline particularly caused some problems when we were selecting a countertop The pattern we selected was in short supply and it was not ordered in time for installation before we moved in To their credit the owners of Horizon recognized the problem and they absorbed the cost of a different upgraded countertop which we appreciated

And this brings me to my final point  the owners of Horizon care deeply about their reputation After they realized some of the timing issues we had experienced they offered various upgrades to help us get through the rest of the process

The renovation process is never easy and frankly I never want to do it again But overall we thought the Horizon crews did a good job"
5,"We were in need of a major master bathroom remodel and were referred to Horizon Construction by a friend who had been extremely please with their master bath remodel  The owner Mark came out on time and gave us many suggestions based on the space we have and an estimate of the cost  We visited their show room several times to make our selections and were ready to begin  

The workers all arrived on time and Mark supervised the project from start to finish  Mark was meticulous in making sure all work was completed to his and our satisfaction  The result is a beautiful travertine and quartz bathroom that we will enjoy for many years to come  We highly recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling and will use the company for other remodel projects in the future"
5,This was my first remodel project and I certainly picked the right company  A year later I am completely happy with the end result and will use them again  The schedule was kept and only had 2 change orders which were additional requests from me  Enna was always in contact with me  Mark was always available if needed and the trades were all very nice and very professional  Thank you Horizon Construction  you have a happy customer
4,"I hired Horizon to complete a full remodel of my fathers 3 bedroom2 bath 1152 sq ft starter home circa 1974 that had never been updated  Included in the remodel were custom kitchen and bathrooms new windows and flooring throughout new AC and furnace with new ducting removal of acoustic ceiling new door frontfirecloset replacement throughout full interior and exterior painting and updated electrical and plumbing  The cost  95000  This amount excludes the cost of all kitchen appliances vanitycountertops in bathrooms doors light fixtures window coverings kitchen  bathroom finishes backsplash tile cabinet knobs  drawer pulls sinks faucets showerbath fixtures mirrors door handles new garage door and opener closet shelving  brackets as well as required City permits  

The property was unoccupied throughout the remodel  Overall the workmen employed to perform the multitude of tasks involved with this project did a wonderful job  This was borne out when the house sold 4 days after being listed  Every showing resulted in comments like I tried but I couldnt find any problems the details were addressed many remodels miss the mark with the details Id move in right now if I could

As far as the quality of the work goes I would not hesitate to hire Horizon again  What I would struggle with however are the issues I encountered with project management and administrative matters

The project manager I worked with was Mike  Mike was nice showed a desire to please his clients overall accessible to answer questions and provided sound and helpful design advice  Areas where he can improve include writing things down so he wont forget important issues reading textsemails in their entirety to avoid his clients having to answer questions where information has already been provided in an earlier textemail and showing more finesse in dealing with a client whose opinionrecollection of events differs with his  Ultimately though Mikes a good guy and very relatable
The front office staff were very pleasant to deal with and were attentive to issues that arose  If I had a question it was usually answered quite promptly  If I was dissatisfied with something it was also addressed quite promptly  Enna coowner Yafa and Audrey all stand out as being great to work with  An area that would warrant improvement is the attention to details when it comes to payments  Client payments should be tracked closely by administration so a client does not have to use their time to provide detailed payment information

Every construction project will encounter problems and mistakes  The process has many moving parts  The key factors that helped make this a successful project were that Horizon fulfilled their contractual commitments took responsibility when mistakes were made and rectified problems to the satisfaction of their client

Even after the work was done and I provided the final signoff on the project I encountered an issue that was a result of an understandable mistake on Mikes behalf  Enna was so intent on ensuring I was satisfied that she demonstrated her professionalism by rectifying the problem in record time  She stands by the core philosophy of Horizon Construction  Remodeling to honor their commitment to complete client satisfactionI appreciate and respect that"
5,"Horizon Construction performed the remodel of  my small master bathroom  Given the small size I was expecting any contractor to either price it high or give me second class service  Horizon did neither  The price while a bit higher than other bids was justified by the assignment of a project manager who helped with the design met me at the home improvement store to pick out the specific tiles and provided exact measurements  and who provided me with on going supervision of the workers and timely status updates  

The workers showed up on time and took great care to protect the carpet and the rest of the house    The work quality was excellent  I would highly recommend them for the quality of their work

5,"The project a kitchen renovation that involved demolishing the old kitchen building a completely new kitchen in a different location the old dining area opening a wall and building an addition onto the house to add a wet bar

Overall we had a great experience with Horizon  They delivered what they said they would when they said they would for the price they said it would be  The work crews were friendly and professional we were very impressed by their efficiency and the long hours they often worked to complete the project quickly  As this was our first major renovation we did sometimes feel some stress about communication namely knowing when fixtures and decisions were needed from us but things generally went smoothly  We are very pleased with the final product and would certainly work with Horizon again"
5,My wife and I had Horizon remodel two bathrooms at the same time due to a sub floor problem  The job was performed in a professional manner and actually was complete a week early   The project manager was very professional and assisted us at every step  Bottom line I would use this contractor again when the next project arises  Months after we required some minor followup repairs and contacted Horizon  Michael Reppo the project manager responded almost immediately  He came out and inspected and set up the days the crews were to come out and repair  Really appreciated the prompt and helpful AFTER SERVICE care given to my wife and I
5,This is our 2nd project with Horizon  First was an awesome kitchenfamily room remodel  This time they did a bathroom remodel and porcelain tile flooring living dining entry hall bath laundry  Mark owner provided a detailed estimate of cost as well as telling us what our responsibilities were  There were NO surprise costs  Mark hires skilled workers painter electrician tile guy plumber who are always on time and polite no loud talk or radios able to communicate with me I speak only English do meticulous work and clean up daily before they leave  Mark is on site almost every day to oversee the quality of work  Mark and Enna his wife are great to work with and responsive to all my texts and emails  We are going to use Horizon for our next big project inside staircase redo and new front door  Its great to have a company you can trust
5,Enna and staff are all very helpful We had a complete demo and remodel of our Master Bath  It all came out beautifully and could not be happier
5,We knew from our experience that this would be a big project and it would require patienceWe needed to remove a weight bearing wall and reinforce the foundation in three places This included installing two massive beams in the ceiling to support the roof This was a Kitchen REBUILD This old house had the original 1955 yellow tile and linoleum kitchen We told Mike our Project Manager that our Prime Concern was the end result But we wanted him to be as accurate as possible in estimating the start date and the length of projectand to be HONEST about the predicted time frame He said they could start in 24 weeks as they were so busya good sign he predicted it would take 3 months to complete not including holidays They began within 2 and 12 weeks And they completed our BEAUTIFUL NEW KITCHEN in exactly 3 calendar months which included holidays and weekends We are very happy with the end result quality materials and workmanship
5,Horizon did a great job with our master bathroom remodel  We wanted to update the original master bathroom in our home approximately 20 years old and they had great ideas to help us realize our goal of a creating a open and modern space  Their team was very professional focused on the details and executed the plan we developed together  Everyone including the workers project manager and owners did a great job  Thank you Horizon
5,We hired Horizon Construction to demolish our 1950s kitchen and construct a brand new one From the beginning they were up front and professional  We were overwhelmed with all the many choices with design and color  Since Horizon Construction has a showroom Mark and Enna were able to help us create the vision we had for our kitchen  Once the project was underway we were updated daily by Enna as to when the workers would be here  We were grateful for their reliability since we were living in our home during the construction That made this large project much less stressful  The workers were trustworthy courteous and respectful of our property  Throughout the entire project there were only a few issues as there would be with any project of this magnitude Mark and his project manager Tal addressed them immediately  Horizon Construction was a little more expensive than our other bids but you do get what you pay for  Our kitchen turned out fantastic  We love it
2,They came out to bid the job but when they gave me a price they said that if I did not sign up with them THAT NIGHT then the price would go up by close to 10 even if it was the following morning  I explained that I did not do business that way  Weeks later I asked if they would honor their original price and they quoted me a price that was 15 higher than the original price
4,"After years of dreaming about remodeling our kitchen collecting photos from DIY websites and magazines I was finally able to convince my husband that our 1967 house needed some updating to accommodate our huge family and our hope of aging in place A simple kitchen project became a more extensive downstairs remodel with a new full bathroom and universal shower We spent months making detailed drawings and lists incorporating what we wanted it to look like Being lifelong DIYers we entertained the idea of being an ownercontractor but soon realized that the project would involve many structural changes moving sewer lines load bearing walls etc as well as extensive knowledge of our citys building codes In other words it was beyond our capabilities We narrowed our search for a contractor to four based on recommendations from neighbors and reviews on the internet then received estimates and descriptions of the work to be done Admittedly we were shocked when all the estimates were almost double what we were anticipating the work to cost ahh the price of naivete While not the least expensive Mike Roppo representing Horizon Construction and Remodeling was the most thorough knowledgeable and professional of them all  
Demo started midSeptember final inspection was in midFebruary almost 6 weeks longer than first estimated We had some glitches and delays along the way  additional engineering specs an additional support post adding a new sheer wall etc More time more money We were wisely advised to plan on having a 1520 cushion for unforeseen expenses Stuff happens
Electrical plumbing framing drywall flooring tile cabinets painting finish carpentry the crews were great They all worked hard cleaned the job site daily were respectful communicativewe couldnt have asked for more from them Mike was our goto project manager every step of the way His code of quality even exceeded ours We are so grateful to have had him work with us Mark Besnos  owner of Horizon Construction checked in frequently to make sure the work being done met his high standards as well Marks wife Enna and the office staff Anna and Carolyn kept us informed as to the work schedule and who to expect on the job site They were easy to communicate with and always available to address our questions and concerns
Bottom line we love our remodeled home and would recommend Horizon Remodeling and Constructionyes even to our family members"
5,Recently we were looking to completely remodel our 1968 master bathroom and create a comfortable beautiful and functional retreat  After reading many reviews and viewing several sites we contacted Horizon Construction and Remodeling to take on the project  From the first meeting until the final sign off we found the team to be completely professional knowledgeable and trustworthy  During our initial consultation Mark took our vision and made a beautiful and workable plan that incorporated the custom cabinets and highend finishes which were consistent with our preferences  Those plans were transformed into a stunning and comfortable oasis which we enjoy on a daily basis  When we had questions changes or concerns they were addressed immediately and always to our satisfaction  During several inspections our city inspector commented on the outstanding job the team was doing and the rapid pace at which they were completing projects  The office would keep us informed regarding the daily schedule and as to which teams would be here  The workman are all skilled craftsmen which shows in their work  They were respectful courteous and meticulous  Everyday the workspace and surrounding areas were cleaned methodically taking great care to protect our hardwood floors This process was first rate from beginning to end so much so we will be using them in the future to remodel our kitchen  Quality work craftsmanship at the highest level and a professional team Horizon Construction and Remodeling are top notch and I would recommend them to everyone whether your project is small or large  Horizon can do it all  Thank you Horizon for a job well done
1,"I called for appointment after reading reviews
Met with Horizon on January 12 2016 at least an hour will be giving me an estimate
Jan 23 I called office Mgr Anna to ask why I had not heard back from them told he was working on other projects to and she would check with him ask to be called for update 
Feb 20 2016 I went back into my email and found an email from Michael dated Jan 25 saying Anna said I had called it takes long due to my circumstance but said he would have it by Wed with would be 12716 Today is February 20 2016 and I have not heard from or received any word from Horizon"
5,"We came to Horizon with a home that was in poor shape and needed not only remodeling but also major infrastructure repair and updates such as piping wiring AC and heating etc  Horizon was proactive in advising us on design selection and quality of materials forthcoming with responses to our questions and concerns  I am not what youd call an easy customer but Horizon was very responsive in resolving the issues that inevitably come up with any project of this scope  They have also shown that they are willing to follow up on postproject touchups etc they are determined that we be fully satisfied with the project 

We are extremely happy in our new home it IS like new to us and gladly recommend them  The project was very expensive due to the damage and poor maintenance accruing over many years and Horizon was also helpful in assisting us to find financing when our other sources were VERY slow and unhelpful in responding"
4,"Our kitchen was gross A DIY job by the previous owner on the cheap Nasty drawers and cabinets that would shed wood particles all over our plates A poorly placed dishwasher that couldnt open all the way made it completely useless It needed to go 

We researched contractors for over 6 months Interviewed and got bids from 4 Horizon was the most expensive which was a concern for us  but their strong reviews experience and overall professionalism gave us peace of mind that was worth the additional cost 

They worked with our budget to put together a plan that met our needs After signing with them there were some unexpected things that came up A few change orders and our project manager left the company just as we started demo But throughout Mark and Enna were helpful and responsive  

The foreman Effy and his whole crew were great to work with and they made a point to leave the job site neat and tidy at the end of the day

This was our first major remodel and were not the most laid back folks So it was stressful Despite all of our little worries along the way Horizon ultimately came through and gave us the beautiful kitchen that we had been dreaming of"
4,My kitchen project involved completely demolishing my old kitchen and making a brand new one This also involved removing a loadbearing post and widening the opening to my living room When I first spoke with Horizon I had no idea what I wanted to do with the space other than removing the loadbearing post and opening the doorway The first time I met with the Project Manager he showed me pictures of other kitchens measured my existing kitchen and sketched out some ideas of how the space could be redone I appreciated the time he took to help develop how the new space would look As with any construction project there were a couple minor delays and thats to be expected As a result the project took a bit longer to complete than anticipated What resulted was a beautiful functional new kitchen and I am so happy with the outcome While the Project Manager that I had initially worked with left the company midproject the work continued to be carried out as planned I only met Mark one time toward the latter part of the project but was told that he had been at my home regularly throughout the project Enna was my email angel always replying in a timely manner to my questions and concerns The foreman that worked at my house was very helpful and kept in communication with me I love my new kitchen and look forward to many years of enjoyment with family and friends I would use Horizon again for future home improvement projects
5,Hi EnnaMark was here this morning to check out our Bathroom and we are sad we missed him  We wanted to give him a great big thank you and a hug  Please tell him thanks from us  Thanks to you too Enna Caroline Anna Sam and your whole crew  You all have made this experience very pleasant  All of you have been kind considerate and made us feel like we mattered  We appreciate youWe absolutely love our bathroom  Its beautiful and works so much better for us  I have been posting pictures and telling friends and family about the whole experience  I have one lady who may redo her bathrooms and another today that asked for your name to give to her daughter  We will continue to brag about you and our bathroomThank you againMarlene and Dennis Baker
5,This was the fourth project that Horizon Construction has done for us They did a complete remodel of our kitchen both bathrooms and removed popcorn ceilings and repainted two family rooms This project involved removing a chimney that sat perpendicular from the wall in the middle of our family room They did the complete demo in one day sealing off the room with plastic to cut down on dust as much as they could Very impressed They had to patch the roof patch the ceiling and the wall The very creative part was what to do with the floor area where the chimney base had been The tile on the floor surrounding the area was discontinued so we were able to find a similar tile that their amazing tile guy laid at a diagonal and it looks fantastic As I have always stated before Horizon is not perfect let me know if you do find a contractor who does perfect work the very first time But they will always make sure you are completely satisfied with the work before leaving no matter what I respect that and that is why they have come back to do work at our house four times
5,Master Bath Remodel  This is the third time we hired Horizon  We were very happy with their previous work a kitchen remodel and replacing all the crown molding and baseboards throughout the house so we had no hesitation in hiring them again   Mark came over and we talked through our wish list for the bathroom remodel  He offered useful suggestions and came back to us quickly with a detail plan and a price  Mark met with us twice at the tile store to help us make our selections  The whole project then proceeded very smoothly  Enna was quite helpful along the way in keeping us up to date and on top of all the decisions that had to be made  Workers were there every day and they were all wellskilled polite and neat  There were a few issues that came up but Mark and Enna and the workers always heard our concerns and made sure that everything was always completed to our complete satisfaction   The bathroom turned out beautifully with clean lines and gorgeous materials just like we dreamed of
5,"Description Of Work

Member Comments 


The project timeline was extended significantly by the discovery of the need for foundation work and the involvement of the City in that process  Otherwise all the work of the contractor was excellent timely and efficient  Every day the worksite was left clean and the house was livable through entire process  Workers were very skilled and eager to please and did excellent work We had purchased new lighting for the house and they arranged for an electrician to do the installation for us

Omri the project manager was excellent at keeping us apprised of scheduled work times and visits and with suggestions or variations of our ideas to enhance the house further The business owner Mark was on site from time to time including at the foundation specialists initial visit Occasionally additional work was recommended generally for completion of the remodeling or as recommended for long term benefit

Horizons quality of work is excellent they are honest and the price of the work is fair I can not overstate my satisfaction with my relationship with them"
5,"My husband and I started our remodeling journey in February 2015 At first we wanted to just update our kitchen But after a while we decided to expand the project and remove the walls between the kitchen dining room and family room and create one big open space We worked with a construction company for more than 3 months We met with them many times and finally we decided they were not up to the task 
My husband found Horizon from the Angies list and he setup an appointment  When Mark came to our house he explained the process to us They would do the the plans get them approved  by the city and then we could use him for construction or go with another companies He gave us a reasonable price for the drawings He also showed us many pictures from different projects he had worked on Projects in which he had moved or removed walls That was important to me Horizon move very quickly and we had  approved plans in less than 3 weeks Our project was not just upgrading rooms There was serious structural change we needed to do Removing all 3 load bearing walls and adding 2 huge beams across the house It still scares me when I think about it 
The construction project was supposed to take 3 months The crews were in our house almost every day And they worked really hard The job site was kept clean and organized We had a payment chart so we paid each piece after it was done Demolition material footers etc I never forget the day we came home after a 3 day trip and saw the walls completely gone beams up there and for the first time we could see our new space It was very exciting There were no big surprises but a few issues did come up but Mark and his team explained them and we work through them easily Mark responded to all of our concerns and questions and was  always available
The project finished just under 3 months and we are extremely happy with the result and experience Mark and his team are true professionals I also want to add that Enna was very helpful in the entire process keeping us uptodate Horizon made this project look easy But I know it was not They basically took our 1970 old outdated and dark house and brought it to year 2015 making it look bright and open Thank you Horizon Construction"
5,We chose Horizon Construction for  a master bathroom remodel The company was very professional the project manager was extremely organized Workers showed up each day when scheduled and left everything clean at the end of the day The owner always did a final inspection The final product was beautiful We will definitely use them again for the next remodel
5,The project went smoothly from beginning to end  Omri the project manager was very helpful and patient in helping choose the tile and fixtures for the bathroom  Tal and his crew were very good at their jobs whether it be the demo or the plumbing or tiling Enna in the office kept us informed of the schedule which was very helpful  The end result is a beautiful bathroom that we love  Thank you Horizon
5,"Not many people would describe a kitchen renovation as a pleasant experience but my husband and I would 

Ours is a 50s tract home and we wanted to update the small kitchen without it looking out of synch with the rest of the house what we like to call mid century modest AND we wanted to incorporate our vintage white Wedgewood range Were a bit eclectic in our taste and were looking for someone who got our visionkind of mid century without the kitsch or the ultra moderne style with maybe a little Craftsman thrown in for good measure It was a challenge to find that someone in our area

We initially got quotes from two other contractors who were willing to do what we thought we wanted When we met with our third candidate Mark Besnos of Horizon Construction  Remodeling and described our desire to for instance relocate the sink Mark said You dont want to do that At first we were taken aback then saw the wisdom when he explained why moving the sink would be a big mistake He was absolutely right and we hired him on the spot

From Day 1 we were impressed by the steady communication with the office run by his lovely wife Enna letting us know what to expect from day to day and addressing any questions or concerns we might have We were equally impressed by the attention to detail and overall craftsmanship performed by each member of Marks crew every single detail was honed to perfectioncabinetry floor tile backsplash paint installations even cleanup A few changes were accommodated without undue stress or expense 

We did have one unfortunate surprise when the loadbearing wall with the passthrough between the dining area and kitchen turned out to need reinforcement due to the work of the handyman who had owned the house before us He had actually cut the support beams to create the passthrough left them dangling and then just closed up the wall Its a miracle the house didnt fall down during an earthquake So even though the fix meant a little more money than we anticipated it was absolutely necessary and we now have a safer more stable home And the passthrough looks stunning 

I did want to mention that the Caesarstone Concrete countertop is NOT suitable for a family with kids as it shows every handprint and drip I failed to read the caveat on the Caesarstone Care  Maintenance page that clearly states Please understand that Honed Concrete and Motivo finishes will require more daily maintenance than our polished finishes Since there is more exposed surface area with these finishes metal marks fingerprints and other signs of daily living will show on these materials Bottom line Ive become a bit obsessive with a micro fiber towel always at hand

Horizon is a small familyowned business run by and staffed by kind caring and competent professionals each of whom goes the extra mile to provide complete customer satisfaction Even though Mark had to leave the country unexpectedly the job stayed on track during his absence and was finished within the expected timeframe 

Its no wonder Horizon has so many positive reviews and we will definitely be using them again when were ready to tackle our outdated bathrooms"
5,We had no intention of redoing our 58yearold kitchen we had put up with it for so long until Anna from Horizon called one day  I never appreciate sales calls but Anna was so pleasant that I scheduled a consultation with Mark  He was very thorough and helpful  Before we knew it our kitchen was being completely renovated  Everyone at Horizon was very patient with us as we chose materials and I invariably worried about everything  Mark and Enna kept reassuring me that it would all be fine and they would take care of everything  And they did  They redid our kitchen and pantry from top to bottom  They also replaced the floor in the entry and guest bathroom and replaced all the door and floor moldings  Their workers were skilled very polite and respectful and cleaned up after themselves every afternoon before they left  The finished kitchen is gorgeous  Exactly what I wantedsimple clean and warm  It is a perfect kitchen for this house  Any issues large or small that arose were taken care of to our satisfaction Mark Enna and the rest of their office and construction crew were wonderful  Im actually going to miss them  I would not hesitate to recommend them and I will not hesitate to call them for future projects
5,We are very pleased with our new master bathroom It is gorgeous The bathroom was gutted and Horizon replaced the tiled walkin shower and bathroom floor installed a custom vanity and two huge framed mirrors and all new plumbing and electrical fixtures They also scraped textured and painted our master bedroom ceiling Mark was creative in helping us with design ideas and made sure all the details that we envisioned were taken care of to our satisfaction Enna was in the office and guided us through the process answering any questions or concerns we had along the way She was knowledgeable herself or she referred our questions to Mark or Tal our foreman Communication was quick and constanteither by email or phone All the people who worked on our project were courteous competent and kept our home as clean as possible tidying up each day before leaving Our project started on time and finished on time with people working every day We always felt we were in very good hands With anyone else we might have had a nice bathroom but with Horizon we have a BEAUTIFUL bathroom
5,"Services provided Bathroom remodels bathroom addition tongueingroove ceiling builtin cabinetry  around fireplace pergola fencing 
My husband and I are extremely happy with the work performed by Horizon Construction All the builtins and cabinetry work are beautiful The bathrooms are the envy of our friends and neighbors Every team of construction specialists that came into our house took great pride in their work And outside the pergola and new fencing are beautiful as well Indeed our house could be featured as a before and after transformation in a designer magazine With a project of this magnitude there are bound to be surprises behind the walls What was so great about Horizon was that they stepped up to the plate and went above and beyond to resolve every issue Customer service is not just lip service with them they take it to heart Their reputation as a premier remodeler is very important to them Our project manager Omri Nave was professional and extremely responsive as was Enna Eskin in the office 
As a side note I should add that we were originally going with another contractor recommended by friends but after many weeks and still no firm bid from that contractor I searched for a contractor on Angies List  Omri from Horizon came out immediately and met with my husband at the house we had just purchased I was in Arizona at the time Omri worked until very late that night to prepare the detailed bid and my husband signed on the dotted line without hesitation
It is never easy to go through a remodel project of this size especially while you are living in the house But we are so grateful to the Horizon team for their professionalism and dedication to customer satisfaction What few issues came up were resolved quickly and without hassle We would recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling without reservation"
5,"I have never written a review about any company before mainly because I have never worked with a company that delivered what it promised  That ended when we contracted Horizon Construction and Remodeling Not only was the work done beautifully but was finished within the timeline we set and they delivered as promised
I cant say enough about this company  Mark Besnos and his crew are without a doubt the best contractor and professionals we have ever worked with  When we first met with Mark we knew he was the right guy  He works within your budget and has so many great ideas that help with your design decision making   Also behind every successful company there is a very professional office staff  Enna Eskin makes sure that all the paper work is done and expedited on time  Shes great to work with and is there to answer any questions you might have  You feel like family with this company because they take such good care of you  
Mark oversees every aspect of the project himself He arrived everyday before and after his workers finished their work and walked through the project and inspected it  If something didnt meet his approval he would tag it and have them redo it  He is a perfectionist and it shows when the project is done  His crew cleaned up every night after they finished their work and left us with a clean house to live in and that was not an easy task to do  We remodeled out Master Bath put new granite and a backsplash in the kitchen installed wood floors throughout the house and a beautiful new staircase
If you are looking for the Rolls Royce of Contractors dont look any further  Horizon Construction and Remodeling is the company for you want  You wont be disappointed"
4,"When we bought our home we knew we wanted to take on a massive remodelupgrade We interviewed and gathered estimates from four Southern California general contractors all of them coming in with high ratings and reviews from Houzz Yelp Angies List and BBB Horizon did not come in the lowest bidder however their professionalism conduct of business their interaction with their clients and attention to detail was what made them stand out from the others 

Undergoing a project as big as ours a complete remodel of master bath all new windows and doors new flooring throughout the house a complete new stair case opening up a room blowing out wall painting the whole interior changing out hardware adding a pergola and incorporating a 15 bifold door there are going to be bumps and unforeseen turns in the road 

From relocating an outlet for daily convenience to installing a new header beam to comply with city permitting no task was too small for Horizon the scope of our remodeling project Their team of designers and contractors walked us through picking out our materials gave us experienced advice and listened to our dream home vision What we originally though we wanted or thought about forgoing Horizon helped us plan and design around our budget and keep the big picture in perspective At the end of the sixmonth project we were very impressed with how Horizon handed all the different types of issues and challenges that arouse 

This house is our 20 year home where will be raising our children having family gatherings and hosting countless friends We have now lived the home for three months construction free and we are very happy with the quality of service and out come of our remodel done by the team at Horizon Construction and Remodel"
5,I hired Horizon for an excavation and construction project for a second living unit on my property They made the whole process so smooth Omer the project manager and designer was extremely helpful I felt like I was his only priority He made the hardest stage of my project so easy I have actually gained a friend from the process that we went through and him making it so enjoyable There was not a single struggle even in the inevitable unforeseen obstacles He made them dissolve In a way I want to have another project just so I can work with them all over again
5,Working with Mark and Enna from Horizon Construction and Remodeling was a great experience  They were professional punctual precise and communicative  Each day work was performed their workers made sure to leave as little impact or disturbance in the area  The work done is of high quality  they were able to transform our bathroom out of the 1960s into something modern clean and functional  We were in constant communication via textphoneemail  They were very patient when we were picking out our cabinet colors  leaving us samples to ensure that we got the exact color and style we wanted  And of the three contractors we bid the job out to there price was very reasonable  I appreciated the personal touch they add to their service  always making sure that we were satisfied with each step of the process  We will definitely be calling Mark and Enna again when it comes time to get our kitchen out of the 60s
5,The project included ceiling repair and remodeling in entry hall dining room and living room  The process was easy efficient and included myself throughout the steps  Pricing was fair timing was accommodating and I am most pleased with the results  Omer Barel was terrific and made me feel that I was in most capable confident hands  Overall a good experience and I would recommend them to anyone
5,This is the kitchen my wife has been waiting for since we bought our house 16 years ago  She loves the final product  To be honest we were not planning on spending this much on our kitchen remodel however we chose Horizon based on over 100 reviews and our experiences with other contractors in the past  So based on the reviews we knew we were going to spend more money than the average kitchen remodel  Having dealt with several projects over the years I also was aware we were going to go over budget along with having some challenges along the way  We did have a couple of issues that looked like they were going to go sideways but Horizon listened to and took care of those issues to the best of their ability each timeand to good effect  I spent the most time communicating with Ennaalmost always over the phone or by Emailand found her easy to work with  I had read reviews that said some things about Enna being difficult to get along with but I did not find that to be the case  Keep in mind all of the reviews that had those comments in them did not actually have work done by Horizon  Enna was there to help solve a couple of problems by making certain one of her crew got to our house by coming to our house herself or by for example crediting us 741 for the ceiling drywall replacement because I thought we did not need to replace it  There were several Horizon employees that helped the remodeling experience often stressful more tolerable  Horizon arranged to have a PortaPotty outside our house so the workers would not have to use our bathrooms  They also arranged the appointments with the city for the permit inspections  There were some communication problems at times however I soon learned that going straight to Enna was the best way to solve any problems that cropped up  If anyone wonders why I rated Horizon a B for price I have a simple answer  their are not the lowend bidthey are likely closer to the higherend bid  But you get what you pay for  So the B is to give prospective customers a headsup that you ought to plan accordingly  That said we chose an expensive beautiful piece of granite had special spacesaving aspects added to our cabinets glasstile backsplash undercounter lighting travertine tile floor and more  There were no significant surprises except    WE REALLY LOVE OUR NEW KITCHEN  However I would say that was more of an expectation than a surprise
5,Due to a water leak issue I had to remodel my kitchen and part of the family room  After many interviews and careful consideration I selected Horizon Construction and Remodeling who in addition was highly rated by customers on Angies list  It proved to be a very good decision  Mr Ormi Nave was my Project Manager whose expertise guided me through design style and material selections  The cabinet maker electrician plumber painterdrywall tile installer were all excellent at their craft  Upper management also reviewed onsite work excellence and progression  The Horizon team maintained a high level of professionalism and integrity throughout the entire project   I highly recommend Horizon for your next project
5,Our project consisted of a complete kitchen remodel including soffit removal and fireplace facelift along with new flooring and cabinets in the bathroom and laundry room  We also replaced the flooring in the entry way as well as the coat closet and linen cabinet    Horizon Construction was not the least or most expensive quote we gathered  One deciding factor for us was that Mark offered ideas and suggestions during the quoting process  We had a general concept that we were shooting for but this was our first kitchen remodel so we were also looking for expert advice on layout materials and design  Response time to questions and change orders was quick  As with any work in an older home surprises occurred and adjustments were made throughout the project which affected the timeline and cost  Mark walked us through these obstacles as he knew we were detail oriented  We did experience some discrepancies in what was agreed upon with Mark and what was executed by the crew  These mistakes were all quickly fixed at no additional cost to us other than time lost  We had an assigned foreman for some of the trades but ultimately Mark acted as our main point of contact for everything  The crew was professional hardworking and respectful  We were not pleased with the semicustom cabinet installers  Horizons custom cabinet maker who worked on some of our other pieces was much better with a higher quality product   Final cabinet details were fixed and completed in a timely manner by him  Overall we were very pleased with the final results
5,"Kitchen Remodel
Horizon just completed a gut rehab remodel of our kitchen which included removing a wall and we were very pleased with the whole process This was our first remodeling project and we didnt quite know what to expect going into it We worked primarily with Omri who did an absolutely wonderful job keeping everything on track and helping us each step of the way He truly went above and beyond to ensure that our needs were met and that we were happy with the end result The remodel was completed in a timely manner and each of the work crews that came in were courteous professional and cleaned everything up at the end of each day Another plus for us was that Horizon was all inclusive We didnt have to choose a separate place to buyinstall the cabinets from and another for the counters etc They handle everything which makes it so much easier"
5,Horizon Construction did an incredible job on our kitchen from day one  Omri and Mark have been there each step of the way with great ideas and suggestions and then they bring fantastic workers in to make them a reality  From countertops to cabinets to floors and plumbing they have the best of the best working for them  We had a kitchen wall that needed to be removed and needless to say my wife and I were worried about tearing our house apart  Horizon managed the process with precision and now the house looks like it was originally built without that wall I cant say enough good things about this team  they are professional diligent responsible fairly priced and they always do what they say they are going to do  We have had a couple of issues along the way but Horizon demonstrated their commitment to customer service each time something came up  They take responsibility and fix issues as they arise without any questions  I would highly recommend Horizon to friends and family and encourage anyone considering a remodel to use them
5,"Removed bathtub in master suite and constructed a walkin shower added a second water line to accommodate the shower heads constructed a pocket door to separate the bedroom from the dressing room  Electrical included led lights in my home office and other electrical work  installed new faucets in the kitchen and 3 bathrooms and painted

I chose Horizon Construction and Remodeling HCR because of their excellent presentation and fabulous reputation on Angies List This was a wise decision because HCR proved to be an ethical caring and efficient company My original remodeling job was to remove the bathtub in the master suite and install a walkin shower During the remodeling I added additional electrical plumbing changes and repairs to my home The HCR crew held my hands throughout the whole process The office staff called me frequently to check how I was doing and to make sure everything was going okay  The workers in my home were hardworking fast and clean There were a couple of hiccups with the job but I was very impressed with the prompt same day actions taken to correct any problems In addition all inspections were passed on first try The price was reasonable for all of the work done and some things were not even charged I whole heartedly recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling and I will call them again for my next remodeling project

5,Our contractor was Mark Besnos  Mark is definitely who you want doing your remodeling  Mark is fastidious  His attention to detail was unbelievable  As picky as he is I wouldnt want to be his wife  As with any job there were things that needed tweaking  Mark made sure everything was absolutely perfect  We had an issue with the stainless steel tiles for the backsplash  After installing it was obvious that some of the tiles had a different finish brushed finish instead of shiny finish  Mark had the tile company come to the house  He made sure the issue was fixed  His office staff Enna and Anna were terrific  There was never a time when I called that I didnt get a hold of Mark Enna or Anna  The best part everyone who has come to see the kitchen even all the subcontractors complimented us on the kitchen  It should be on the cover of Better Homes  Gardens  Sherry
5,"There are already the wellacknowledged passages associated with life birth marriage divorce graduation the new job Id like to add one moreremodeling

The decision to embark upon the renovation path in most cases involves entering into a relationship with a contractor Selecting one in many respects is only slightly less important than say choosing a spouse or deciding to have children Remodeling your home can be a journey filled with uncertainty havoc and frustration as you work toward the beautiful surroundings you envisioned those many months earlier As the old knight who guarded the room of chalices in a scene from the movie Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade mused Choose wisely 

Fortunately we did when we contracted with Mark of Horizon Construction You want your contractor to be competent trustworthy and reliable Mark was all of these and more 

Mark takes a personal interest in his work He is on the site much of the time ensuring that his workers are doing their best When things go wrong he makes sure they get fixed Like any relationship there will be disagreements or misunderstandings but Mark handled them in a professional and sincere manner The bottom line here is that Mark wants his customers to be happy

I could relate several episodes of Marks commitment to customer satisfaction but the one that meant the most to us was when we had a sewer line back up into the house no fault of Marks Out of panic I called Mark and he came out immediately and with his foreman worked on clearing the line He didnt have to do that He could have told us to call a plumber and gone back to what he was doing

I highly recommend Horizon Construction and Mark as your choice for your remodel project You will have chosen wisely"
4,"My initial experience with Enna when I first called to set up an appointment was very professional and pleasant We set up an appointment to meet with Mark the GC within 2 weeks of the call Mark was professional listened well to what we had in mind augmented these visions with his own excellent design ideas and made us feel very confident at the first meeting that Horizon was likely the best choice for us After meeting with several other GCs over the next few weeks Horizon was in our top 3 finalists and we made the choice to move forward with them based on our feelings of confidence that they really understood what we wanted to do Horizon was not the lowest bidder nor were they the highest
 After confirming with Mark our choice to move forward with Horizon we met with him again to go over in more detail the project scope and timeline and to sign paperwork for the plan development The initial project timeline was identified as 1012 weeks Soon after this meeting he swiftly had plans drawn up for the architectural changes to our kitchen and living room and submitted them for approval Expecting approval to take several weeks Mark suggested we start working on the master bathroom remodel so as not to lose momentum During Master Bath demolition Mark identified some unanticipated framing work after the walls were stripped Although I was not expecting this we compromised on the cost of addressing this work which set the tone for addressing unexpected work going forward Work on the Master Bath went longer than expected based on some changes to scope as well as some permit hangups but the finished product was exactly what we wanted
 Approval of the KitchenLiving Room plans came back quicker than expected in a few days as opposed to weeks and work on the kitchen and living room commenced and ran concurrent with the work on the master bathroom This work involved removing walls between the galley kitchen the den4th bedroom the living room and the dining area with the ultimate design goal being a great room spanning all of these areas Due to removing loadbearing walls support beams had to be installed in the attic and 6 foot deep underpinnings had to be dug and placed in a several areas Although the inside of our house was unrecognizable the work proceeded on schedule for the most part During the project we did make some adjustments to overall scope not changing planned work just adding new work to overall scope eg originally we had no intention of touching the fireplace or any of the bedrooms we made some decisions midstream to have Horizon redo the fireplace
 and floor and paint all of the bedrooms based upon design ideas from Mark Change management on these items and other items was handled well by Enna After the Master Bathroom completed Horizon started on the guest bathroom remodel which involved the following

  Removal of HVAC unit from closet adjacent to the bathroom
  Demolition of walls between HVAC closet bathroom and adjacent coat closet
  Installation of new HVAC unit in the attic

 Utilizing the square footage from the HVAC closet and the coat closet effectively doubled the square footage of the guest bathroom allowing us to convert it into a full bath with double vanity from a ¾ bath This was the last aspect of the project to completeConsidering that we lived in the house through the project with the exception of 3 noncontinuous weeks for vacation we were eager to see the project complete and we are extremely happy with the results Horizon saw the vision we had for transforming the interior of our 55 year old ranch style house into something more modern and beautiful and they executed on it
 The only negative thing I feel compelled to note is that the crew was not considerate about keeping the work site clean Paint brushes were rinsed out in the plants in the front yard razors cuttings from wood discarded pieces of wire food wrappings etc continually littered my front yard and driveway I asked Mark and Enna to address with their crew at least two times however it didnt fix the situation and I ultimately ended up cleaning up after the crew This may seem petty or perhaps I am naïve about a project of this magnitude but it made me feel disrespected as a customer for my concerns about this to go effectively ignored
 Lastly I have to say that Horizon Construction Mark Enna and their whole crew were extremely friendly and nice throughout the entirety of the project Never once did I second guess my choice By the end of the project I still felt comfortable that we had made the best choice Since the completion of the project Horizon has cheerfully addressed any issues that have come up"
5,We hired Mark and his team to come and install Marble flooring in our formal diningliving room They were quick efficient and very clean He was very thorough about what the layout was going to look like making sure to ask if I had any changes to the design It came out looking gorgeous Enna was also very personable and thorough Confirmations for everything was emailed and discussed so there were no surprises or hiccups and misunderstandings Overall they did a great job
5,"We have been working with Horizon Construction for many years now Their projects are beautiful and we are proud to be a part of it They are detail oriented and give close attention to every aspect of their work Enna  Mark have been a pleasure to work with easy going and pleasant

5,"When we first met Mark Besnos owner at our house he asked a lot of questions offered suggestions and was not at all afraid to offer his opinion when he thought we were wrong this can be offputting I suppose except after you work with Mark for a while you will come to appreciate that he really knows what he is doing and you should listen to him  Of the five bids we received for this work Marks was by far the most detailed and the only one that covered all of the details we discussed  Not the cheapest bid by far but when I went back and looked at the holes in the other bids I had no doubt they would have change ordered us to death and I would have ended up spending the same or more likely more

The work started promptly and once started stayed pretty much on schedule throughout  Enna always kept us informed when things were going to be done so there were never any major surprises  There were problems along the way as there always are in remodeling and this is where Horizon really shines in my opinion  Mark always said Dont worry we will take care of it and they always did  Every time  If you have had remodel work done before you know how rare this is  Its the way a business should be run unfortunately many contractors dont seem to get it

We are extremely pleased with the work they did  In particular our master bath which has all new cabinetry onyx counter travertine floors and shower walls frameless glass shower and rainfall shower are spectacular  I remark to my wife when I get out of the shower in the morning that I feel like Im staying at the Ritz Carlton 

Thanks Mark and Enna  You guys are great"
5,We have working with Horizon for many years they give every customer personalized attention and they have an eye for detail work They are experts in the area of remodeling with an eye for fresh ideas in the design field Trusted reliable service It doesnt get any better in customer service
5,"The remodeling included the demolition and reconstruction of 2 bathrooms It included converting the guest bath to a walkin shower with tile and a frameless glass enclosure The job included replacing the vanities countertops installing porcelain tile throughout new bathtub installed in the master bath changes to the plumbing and all new fixtures including sinks exhaust fans and lighting 
We selected Horizon Construction  Remodeling because of the good ratings they received from customers who had work done by them The cost was higher than some other quotes I received but I was concerned about the quality of the workmanship and considered the customer satisfaction ratings Horizon received from their customers As it turned out the work was completed on time within budget and the quality of the work was excellent We are very satisfied with how everything turned out As in any project issues arise but they were quickly resolved with no excuses Mark inspected the work as it progressed and Enna communicated with us every step of the way so there were no surprises They got a building permit from the City of Huntington Beach for the remodeling as we requested and we had no problems passing any phase of the inspection process We would recommend them to our friends"

Member Comments 
This was the second project weve contracted with Horizon first was a kitchen remodel in 2009 Work was completed on schedule within budget and met all our expectations Horizon kept us apprised of the progress by email eg Tomorrow they will install the counter top They stayed on the job until every item on our Punch List had been addressed to our satisfaction Mark and Enna are a very nice couple and are a joy to work with When unforeseen problems arise and they always do Ennas voice over the phone is very calming and reassuring and indeed all problems were resolved Mark walks through the project frequently and will spot items that dont meet his expectations and see that they are corrected without us having to say a word
We will definitely use them again for our next project"
5,Horizon had to take down two walls and put In a beam to create our open layout kitchen It was a huge job and we took three bids But the other two bids wouldnt take out the walls and we didnt want to settle Mark said yes right away and brought an engineer who gave the okay Every change easy passed by us for approval and the work was done very well Issues we had after the remodel were handled Someone visiting said it looked like it was always there but my husband and I know what a huge transformation this kitchen was to our house and our lives Enna was a great lifeline through the whole project which was completed before the estimated time
5,"Complete remodel of kitchen demo of old exterior concrete stone and fireplace Replaced with stack stone Installation of wood flooring 


We went through several contractors 6 to be exact before we found the right one From the moment we called Horizon Construction Enna made use feel very comfortable We explained to Enna what we wanted and what we were looking for She stated that Mark Besnos would be out to see us and see what he can do Mark who is the owner and designer gave us a very beautiful vision of what our kitchen would look like We felt at ease with Mark and fell in love with his ideas We have finally found our contractor We only had signed a contract with Horizon to remodel our kitchen but asked mark what he could also do with the exterior of the house and gave us another beautiful vision He recommended to remove the old concrete stone around the house and by the fireplace and replace it with stack stone The final out come is amazing We also wanted to remove the old carpet and install wood flooring and gave him the job as well and they did an excellent job of installing our wood flooring Our overall experience with the Horizon Construction crew was very good The crew was very polite on time and cleaned up after them selves at the end of the work day Mark and his foreman Elly were there almost everyday to ensure that the projects were getting done as we have specified and would correct any issues we had with some of the installations Given the amount of time we gave Horizon Construction they finished the job as specified and did a beautiful job We have gotten many many compliments on our house and can only thank Mark Enna Elly and the Horizon Construction crew for all there hard work and for making our experience and great one"
5,"Just want to say that we are extremely happy with the kitchen remodel that Horizon Construction completed for us Our home was built in the late 1940s and was really showing its age We wanted to have an open floor plan that incorporated the kitchen dining room and living room We had some ideas and a budget for what we were willing to spend Mark took our ideas and make them come to life He has an eye for design and style and a commitment to quality and detail He and Enna are both committed to making sure their clients are satisfied and happy
We took out a load bearing wall between the old kitchen and living room and now have a wonderful large room This was the second kitchen remodel I have lived through and this one was definitely the best Mark said he would be finished in 9 weeks and he was Their crew worked Monday through Friday and showed up every day  Enna called daily to keep us up to date making sure we had appliances and spec sheets ready for the crew and making sure all our questions were answered 
Mark was at the house every morning to direct the crew and attend to any details He made sure that everything that we couldnt see was done correctly as well as attending to details like overhead lamp and outlet placement and overall design functionality and appearance Mark had the placement of the lamp over our dining table changed several times without our knowing until he was satisfied that it would be in the right place  and it was
The crew was absolutely great They arrived at about the same time every morning went right to work but were always patient and answered any questions we may have had The absolute best thing is that they cleaned up their work area every day without fail They put up plastic so construction dust in the rest of the house was kept to a minimum which I really appreciated
If you are wondering if Horizon is the company for you  our answer is YES Do it you will be very happy with the result We sure are"
5,"We chose Horizon Construction because of Marks vision for our bathrooms in our initial consultation Our bathrooms are rather small and we had a few ideas of what we wanted before Mark came over but he quickly suggested what would and wouldnt work based on his extensive experience and design knowledge Mark is very good at being straightforward with you on what needs to be done for the space you have to renovate Some might consider his straightforwardness slightly abrupt but dont let that put you off  hes very good at what he does and has a passion for his work and the details and he knows the work his crew does is a reflection of himself and his company as he should

We mainly interacted with Enna Horizons business manager and design consultant from that point forward though Mark did visit the project regularly He also made himself available at any time should you want to go over any details with him Ennas responsiveness and regular communication is a big reason we are as happy as we are with how the project turned out Not many contracting companies have someone like Enna to be your customer service rep design consultant project coordinator complaint department etc Enna is very responsive competent nice and professional and made the 2 months of having workers in our home a tolerable and almost pleasant   experience 

Day one Enna and Mark met us at the tile store to sign the contracts and help us pick out flooring countertops and glass borders which was incredibly helpful Work began quickly afterwards and the crew was at our house just about every week day for around 2 months Each crew member was very nice respectful hard working and we trusted them implicitly to work and lock up after themselves while we were at work Coming home from work each day was an exciting event seeing progress was a treat and they always cleaned up after themselves each day 

Mark visited the site regularly and corrected any issues and small details he found and listened to any concerns we had We never felt we were being given the runaround or that our ideas and concerns were insignificant For example they installed a 4 vanity backsplash which didnt connect well to a 6 wood trim piece We pointed it out and they tore out the marble backsplash and redid it to 6 

Now Im not saying there werent frustrations Some language barriers and miscommunication between ourselves management and the crew reared its head from time to time but whenever issues arose they were always fixed to our satisfaction and never impacted the end product I dont believe you can have a multimonth long project without these issues arising and I chalk them up as normal and dont mark them down for this 

One miscommunication example was that we asked them to put insulation in the shower plumbing wall which bordered the bedroom for noise reduction They forgot to do this during the rough plumbing and said if we still wanted it done they would open up the drywall in the bedroom side then patch and paint the bedroom wall which they did end up doing This was a minor issue and we would have been fine if they didnt want to do the work but they went out of their way to make us happy

Other minor issues stemmed from the crew not looking at the fixtures we purchased before finishing the rough plumbing in the first bathroom Their expectation was that we would point out anything other than standard fixtures we had a bar with handheld shower head they assumed fixed shower head Our expectation was that they would check with us before commencing rough plumbing or at least take a look at the fixtures The result ended up not being a big issue  a slightly less than ideal placement for the water outlet valve However we learned a valuable lesson and made sure to go over rough plumbing for the master bath with them beforehand

In the end both baths turned out beautiful more so than I imagined Overall we had a very positive experience and highly recommend Horizon 

A few tips 
Get your fixtures early unless youre ordering from a big box store some items take a few weeks to get in 

Make sure your expectations and visions are communicated Enna writes up a detailed scope of work make sure this is correct though some items are difficult to envision when you initially go over the contract 

Make sure to meet with Mark and show him your fixtures and expected placements before the crew starts rough plumbing It will be much more difficult to change things once this has started"
5,"We had recently purchased a home and wanted to do some extensive remodeling before we moved in That job included
 Installing a new loft in a room that had a vaulted ceiling and tying that new 2nd floor room into the existing stairs and hallway This included new recessed lighting for both the new loft and the nowshorter bottom floor room
 Remodel the kitchen including removal of an old fireplace to open up the kitchen and living room new tile floors reface and refinish all cabinets replace all appliances new backsplash
 Create a new bedroom from an existing open space and reframe the closet walls in the new room and in the adjoining master closet
 New wood floors in the 1st floor of the house and new carpeting in the 2nd floor
 New interior paint throughout
 Refinish the front door
 Miscellaneous installing new lightsfansetc

This project required securing a few city permits which Horizon did without problem

All in I think this was about a 35mo project We did not move in until it was completed

We now love Angies List because thats how we found Horizon Mark Enna and Eli 

Weve had both good contractor experiences and otherwise We had never used Horizon prior to this job Our experience with Horizon has gone very well over these months We wished we had a bigger budget to have them do more work for us because they do great work at good value but eventually we simply had to stop so we could move in

Horizon is geared for client satisfaction on reasonably sized general contractor jobs Heres a few excerpts of our experience
 As we were settling on early design decisions Mark was really helpful Mark has a unique set of skills in design engineering contracting etc He brought great ideas forward that were good value decisions For example we were creating a new bedroom for our son which was on the small side He recognized that and came up with the idea to reconfigure the closet and master bdrm closet that was reasonable got us a bigger room for our son and made use of wasted space so that the master closet is still the same size or slightly larger
 We had many conversations as normal for such a project about materials finishes and etc Mark was really helpful at guiding those discussions to make good value decisions based on what he heard from us Weve had contractors in the past who really know only one style or pricepoint and try to push it constantly but we felt that Mark did a great job of listening to what we wanted and coming up with good creative ideas and compromises based on our objectives
 Mark Enna and Eli were all consistent and reliable If they said they would meet us at the house at a certain time they were there on time and ready Wed be lying if we said they were perfect but they really made every effort to do their best
 Our area has a substantial list of HOA requirements We never once had a single complaint from a neighbor or HOA the entire time despite a lot of work being done They hauled off their own trash so our little trash bin wasnt overwhelmed and generally kept the place picked up Thanks Eli 
 Shortly after we started wHorizon my husband noticed that somebody had backed into the mailbox and asked Mark if he thought one of his guys had done it Mark just looked at it and said Dont worry Ill fix it A couple days later a new mailbox is there that matched the old one all fixed up No debates just happened
 Near the end of the project my husband made a comment about how the drain plumbing was routed A couple days later it was fixed Again no big debate or issue just happened
 After our front door was refinished the exterior had a green tint to it that we had not expected It wasnt terrible and perhaps we were the only ones who would notice Mark asked how we liked it and could tell from our first reaction we didnt really like how it looked But it was not a terrible issue and we formally told Mark and Enna in writing that wed accept it asis and not to worry resandingfinishing it only for a modest cosmetic issue It looked fine and quality was good but we just had an expectation of a more brownish deep wood finish A week or so later they refinished the door anyway and now looks perfect

There are more little stories like that but you get the point We thought that Horizon was highly focused on Customer Satisfaction in the way they ran the project from beginning to end They took care to do good quality work sought client feedback in a constructive way and addressed issues quickly and practically They had to get some city permits in this project which they got without a big problem and they passed all the city inspections without issue

One of the things which makes Horizon unique from others we considered was that there was no middleman handoff from the Sales rep to the person who actually manages the job We worked with Mark Enna and later Eli throughout the entire project We really enjoyed getting to know them and we thought the continuity of the relationship definitely contributed to the efficient outcome

In our experience with Horizon we found them to be professional ethical skilled and hardworking throughout the process We would recommend Horizon to our own family members

Thank You Horizon You are a great team "
5,"Horizon Construction immediately responded to our request for a quote Mark came out to the house listened to our ideas and helped us to plan a remodel that exactly fit what we wanted He also helped with picking out materials that fit our budget
Work started on time once all permits were approved and moved quickly without any work breaks
There were no issues in contacting Horizon and any issues that came up during the project were quickly addressed 
We would highly recommend the Horizon team Mark Enna and Sam to any of our friends
Looking forward to doing business with them again"
5,"Rescued from a nightmare

We had a horrific experience with another contractor which left us with a bathroom that we couldnt use The contractor lost their license and we were left with realizing we were going to have to start all over again

Horizon came in a rescued us from our misery and delivered a beautiful new master bathroom We were able to even get our guest bathroom a partial facelift too and we paid about the same for all of it The work was done on time and their experts workers were very courteous and always left our house in great shape after a hard days work

We will recommend Horizon to all of our friends and family

5,We recently had new wood floors installed in the entire downstairs of our house  The job included demolition of existing tile and carpet  They hauled away the old tile and carpet and did a wonderful job installing my new floors  Horizon also converted my old patio into a new patiosunroof  They added walls around the existing patio and installed windows and a sliding  glass door and doggy door  I had a wonderful experience working with Horizon Construction and Remodeling  Mark Besnos and Enna Eskin were very pleasant to talk to and they responded to every call I made to them  Mark was on the job frequently to be sure things were being done to my satisfaction  His crew was very hard working and did an excellent job  they were on the job daily and always cleaned up prior to leaving  I was amazed at the progress that was made each day  The entire job took approximately 4 weeks and stayed within my budget  I am very pleased with the final product  My floors are beautiful and I love my new patiosunroom  I would very highly recommend them to anyone that had a  job to be done  I definitely plan to use them again in the future
5,"Mark provided the second estimate on my kitchen remodel  After making some recommendations and suggestions we settled on a design and Mark and Enna did their best to work within my budget while still providing quality materials and equipment  

Enna held my hand through picking out my countertops and cabinets and even guided me through the purchase of my appliances   Mark came up with a great design based on my needs and what I had to work with   Along the way there was some stress and misunderstandings but both Mark and Enna worked tirelessly to make me happy and come up with great resolutions    We were in contact every day either by phone or email and Mark even rushed over on a Saturday when I needed my gas turned back on 

I cant say enough about the finished product  It is one of the most beautiful kitchens Ive ever seen and its mine   Thanks Mark and Enna"
5,"Horizon Construction and Remodeling performed a complete remodel of two bathrooms including expansion of exterior walls to increase size of bathrooms
The completed work went beyond expectations Top quality results The workers were punctual courteous and cleaned up after themselves We enthusiastically recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling for anyone seeking to remodel

5,"Horizon Constructions remodeled our guest bathroom turning a tub into a walkin frameless glass door shower replacing the floor the vanity and the toilet  

Having had my kitchen remodeled with a different contractor I was very impressed by the punctuality of Horizon Construction Enna always kept me updated and in the loop of what to expect and when  Also updated us promptly on any issues or problems

Mark had a very keen eye for design and gave us suggestions on the materials for both the floors and the shower and also few other design elements

Also they replaced the glass door when Mark noticed a crack that both me and my husband missed  We really liked the professionalism and the meticulousness that Mark and Enna showed

It has been two months since the job was completed but I encountered a recent problem with the shower door and contacted Enna about it  She assured us when the job was finished that the bathroom was under warranty as well  She is working on getting the issue addressed  I love the follow up and the fact that they stand behind their work

I would definitely recommend this company"
4,We had a bathroom from 1964 completly remodeled The original bathroom was about 10 ft by 412 ft with a tub shower and dividing wall We had the tub removed and one wall torn out and rebuilt to expand the room by 212 ft We had the original window removed and replaced it with a custom size window which was built into the shower walll This required structural wall modifications and outside stucco work We moved all of the plumbing to allow for a large tile shower to be built This required cutting the slab foundation and installing new drain plumbing for the shower toilet and sink New vent pipes were required and had to be installed in the new wall and thru the roof The shower required extensive plumbing to allow for a cieling rain can body sprays and a hand held head We added a fan light which required venting thru the roof The shower was tiled from floor to cieling and the remainder of the room was also tiled about 40 up from the floor A frameless 38 glass door was also installed Two recessed lights were installed in the shower cieling along with vanity lighting
5,"Horizon remodeled 3 averagesized bathrooms and retiled a fireplace The job included Hotmopping and floating cement on showers installing tile on floors shower bath surround and fireplace installing bathtub custom shower door and vanities quartz countertops sinks toilets faucets fans and lighting painting installing baseboards and bath accessories 

When I first met with Mark Besnos it was clear that he had an eye for detail Mark had some great design ideas and helped me pick out tile cabinets Everything was done very professionally Mark drew up a detailed contract and all changes were made with addendums Mark also provided all of the relevant licenses and insurance documents without having to ask In the end Mark made sure every last detail was perfect 

Enna Eskin did an amazing job managing the project She was always super friendly knowledgeable and professional and was great about using email and text to keep in touch while I was at work Enna kept me informed of what was happening throughout and also let me know ahead of time when there were things that I needed to do 

The work crews were friendly and considerate They worked very hard and performed highquality work They did a good job of protecting my floors and furniture and keeping the mess to a minimum 

I love my new bathrooms and fireplace Everything turned out beautifully and was done on time and within budget"
4,"Early in 2012 we took three contractors bids for a master bath remodel for our home In addition to a price we could afford Horizon Construction gave us some good design ideas and a feeling that they would take good care of us They werent the cheapest bid but we wanted to work with someone who got all the costs out there up front without adding on later We felt thats how they made their bid so we selected them for our job 

The project would remove the small glass shower enclosure and basically unused bathtub that were there from the original home construction and also upgrade the vanity with a nicer piece and put a granite top on it The old toilet would be replaced The linoleum floor would be replaced with tile which would match nicely the tile of the new shower enclosure Since we dont use the bathtub we opted to have more open space beside a larger shower enclosure and no bathtub Horizon would also install the toilet sinks and plumbing fixtures that we furnished for the job mount new mirrors over the vanity install new lighting and paint the walls

My wife and I didnt have firm ideas on the decor so the consultation from Horizon was very helpful We did a session at the building materials showroom together Once we settled on the color scheme and materials and the fixtures that we needed to furnish to them for installation the demolition work began and was finished very quickly and cleanly Horizon did almost all of the work during the daytime when my wife and I were both at work They took good care of our house and securely locked it up at the end of their day when they left

The floor and shower tile work was perfect and the custom glass nothing fancy just clear but its just what we wanted was installed on time and still looks great Partway along Horizon suggested we consider a unique tile backsplash around the vanity using the same accent tiles that are in the floor and the shower They gave us a special price and although we hadnt wanted to add to our budget we took their offer Its a really pretty blue aqua glass tile that is the key element to the whole decoration scheme The look we got is a bit unique and breaks from the cookiecutter conservative approach of the original homebuilder Very nice and more than worth the money If we ever sell the home well point out the very custom look of the vanity

Horizon got the building inspections and everything got approved straight off Once the painting was done there were just a few finishing touches to get but Horizon finished ahead of the project schedule which is nice if your master bathroom opens onto your master bedroom and youre actually trying to live there as we were My son was so glad that we didnt have to share his bathroom any longer But the bottleneck was worth it when work was complete

Incidentally for the new toilet which we picked up at Costco remember tight budget we bought the AMDM IntelliSeat an electronic toilet seat if you dont know what it is just Google itonce you have it you cant go back to replace the standard seat Although Horizon didnt seem to have experience with that product they installed it perfectly and we love it

About six months after the project was completed and wed paid our final check to Horizon the motionsensing light switch theyd installed in the bathroom began malfunctioning It got to be too annoying so I gave Horizon a call to see if theyd fix it for us They reminded me that they made a full warranty on all their work and scheduled someone to come out and work on the switch Their man came to our house and replaced the faulty switch with a new one which now works perfectly

We love our bathroom and are so satisfied with Horizons work They are friendly professionals who follow up deal with issues and problems when they occur finish ahead of schedule and back up their work"
5,"This project included total demo and reconstruction of 3 bathrooms It included converting the master bath from a Roman tub to a walkin shower with travertine to the top of all walls which had cathedral ceilings and a triangular window and replacing toilets vanities sinks and all fixtures In the guest bath the tub was replaced with a new tub and travertine on the walls The sink vanity and toilet were also replaced adding an enclosure using 38 inch sliding doors In the downstairs shower old ceramic tile was removed and replaced with travertine The toilet vanity and sink were also replaced The floors in all bathrooms were removed and replaced with travertine
 
In late September 2012 after getting an estimate from another company for our planned remodel of 2 bathrooms a large master bath and a smaller downstairs bath we made an appointment with Horizon Construction and Remodeling for an estimate We had previously read reviews here on Angies List
Mark arrived at the designated time discussed with us our plans then took measurements of the bathrooms He also made suggestions regarding the project He suggested that we meet with him at MSI to look at a variety of materials so he could more accurately provide an estimate
After deciding to have Horizon do the project we made an appointment with Mark to go over the contract scope of work and the payment schedule It was determined that work could begin on October 3 but since demolition could only begin midday We decided that early morning the following day would be best
The demolition crew arrived as scheduled and the project was started Demolition of the 2 bathrooms was completed in 2 days and work began on the remodel construction Each segment of the project went smoothly In the meantime we went with Mark to select a marble slab for the countertops We also met with the cabinet maker regarding the custom vanities and color of the stain
Work progressed smoothly and ahead of schedule Along the way we made several changes Enna was very helpful in accomplishing those changes and doing the paperwork involved She is an invaluable asset to the company
When the original project was well on its way to completion we decided to go ahead and do the third bathroom since we had enough marble left from the slab to do the countertop Also the vanity in the upstairs guest bath was the same size as the downstairs bath which made the custom construction easier and more efficient
Mark was here on a regular basis to check on progress answer questions and listen to our concerns In some cases he had noticed things that needed correction before we even brought them up
Any remodel project and especially one of this magnitude is stressful I know of several cases where projects lasted much longer than anticipated but that was not the case here The projected completion date was January 10 2013 however work was completed December 15 2012 which made our Holiday Season more enjoyable than it might have otherwise been The master bath which was converted from a Roman tub to a walkin shower is amazing and the other two bathrooms are elegant as well
Horizon Construction and Remodeling is dependable and you can expect them to do what they agreed to do The quality of their work is good and everyone we encountered was responsible for their part of the job My only admonition to you is that you make sure the scope of work that you sign off on includes all the things you discussed and thought would be there
If you have a project in mind call Horizon Remodeling and Construction and give them an opportunity to discuss it with you before you make a final decision We are pleased with how our bathrooms came out and would not hesitate to call Horizon for another project"

5,It was a pleasure working with Mark and Enna and all of their crew members Mark and Enna went out of their way to find just the right fixtures and French doors that  I envisioned for my new master bedroom I am especially happy with the double doors that were hung on my new closet I was very pleased with how much attention was given to the finest details and how quickly they were able to complete the construction
5,We enjoyed working with Mark and Enna to remodel and update our master bathroom Mark was especially helpful during the planning phase when he listened patiently to our endless questions and provided useful information and suggestions that helped us reach decisions about project materials and stylistic choices After work began Mark and Enna continued to be very responsive to us regarding scheduling aspects of the work and finalizing decisions about the details Throughout the process they stressed that the goal was to create a master bathroom that we would really enjoy even if that meant occasionally changing our minds about details or adding new work at times This was our first major renovation project and we feel that Mark Enna and their team did a great job guiding us through it and creating a great new room to enhance our home

5,Dont look anywhere else To say that my job didnt go exactly according to plan would be an understatement and Mario and his entire team were pros from start to finish Our job was a demo of our old guest house and rebuilding designing and installing a beautiful new guest house under the watchful eye of Mario and the team The consistent communication from Mario was also a huge plus as the home is a complete remodel and Im rarely on site Finally remember that you get what you pay for there may be cheaper contractors out there but there arent any better  take that to heart
5,I cant thank SOD Home group enough They were organized from the onset Their presentation was better than anyone else that my family and I looked requested bids from They were great through every step of the process From demolition to installingbuilding everything to having it all completed I enjoyed the process of it all Awesome
5,"Oren from SOD Home Group  led our house renovation project over a period of five weeks  Oren and his team were responsive professional and accommodating of our requirements  from the initial estimate meeting up to the finish of the project We even added items to the original scope along the way and they were still able to complete on time and on budget  
As the project came to an end we had to do a detailed quality check ourselves but once we pointed out any outstanding finishes they finished the job to perfection We would definitely work with Oren and team again for any future renovation needs"
5,This started out as a project to make my mother in laws home ADA compliant and we ended up updating the entire home It seemed logical after discussions with Mario and so we moved forward The project was completed very quickly due to our timeline and the results are phenomenal Working with contractor Mario was a pleasure He is honest and hardworking and is a complete contrast to my previous experiences Will use them for all my future projects
5,"After interviewing several companies for the room addition project we hired SOD Home Group We were very impressed with the vision professionalism and ideas from our sales representative Mario  We valued all the detailed and selfexplanatory estimates and budget including the schedule that was presented to us before we signed the contract When the remodeling project started we were updated daily via emails and additional visits by Mario The people who worked at the house on the project were respectful of our house and they always cleaned at the end of each day They also guided us with all the interior design with the selection of light fixtures floor tiles and paint colorstyle choices At the end of the remodeling project it addressed any detail that we needed additional attention on

5,It was a pleasure working with Oren and his crew we would definitely call them again They were in touch with us almost everyday letting us know what was going on and if we had any questions All of the crews that came were professional flexible and thorough any issues were promptly taken care of without fuss We ended up spending more than we had anticipated mainly because of Orens enthusiasm and the designs they prepared for us were outstanding it was hard to say no The finished work is beautiful we are very happy
5,as a woman I appreciate how respectful Oren was when providing me with an estimate going over the contract and discussing the end results Although I knew nothing about room addition he did not make me feel dumb regardless of how many questions I had or explanations I required He was thorough and transparent He complied with my requests and made sure I was 100 comfortable with moving forward I was impressed how quick and efficiently the team worked After 10 bids and lots of reference checking they were among the best in pricing customer service and job completion
5,SOD Home Group completed a major remodel and home addition project for us  We interviewed a few other contractors but SOD stood out because of their fair pricing confidence and professionalism  We interviewed two other home owners who had used SOD in the past and they had great things to say about Oren and his group  They transformed our ageing 1600 sqft home into an amazing 2900 sq ft that is absolutely breathtaking  Since this was our dream home being built we were very involved in selecting materials for the project and the SOD team was very accommodating They also worked well with other contractors like HVAC fire sprinkler and sidewalk   They executed the job to perfection while coordinating with the city for inspections They did a great job with everything from the laying of the new foundation framing electrical plumbing  The best part was that they did an excellent job of finishing including flooring painting etc  They were very responsive to fixing minor touchups even after we had moved in  I would whole heartedly recommend SOD
5,SOD Home Group folks worked on our bedroom remodel The work was done on time and the quality was great
5,I wanted to do a tech update and remodel to my home in Saratoga The home was outdated for my style The SOD Home Group team could handle everything I had a designer that I wanted to use but they didnt pan out and SOD Home Group hooked me up with another designer who did an amazing job They worked together well so my experience was very easy Oren kept me up to date as far as they progress His experience as a General Contractor made me feel at ease He really knows what hes doing We opened the space up and did a lot of updates including the pool which needed to be updated and repaired The result is exactly what I wanted and I didnt have to stay out of my home longer than estimated which I was nervous about Everything turned out great Worth every penny
5,We were considering remodeling our entire house for several years now and we just never had the money to When we could finally afford it we were so spooked about hiring a contractor Every story we heard was so terrifying Everyone we knew remodeled got ripped off the contractor did a horrible job and had to redo the project or simply took their money and never showed up We went on a couple of different routes to deeply search and find the right contractor for our project After meeting a couple of them we signed a contract with SOD Home Group They had great appearance online and when we asked if they can take us to a few of their completed and ongoing projects Oren did not hesitate Oren immediately agreed We remodeled our kitchen bathrooms living room dining room backyard front yard and added a new laundry room Orens crew was so respectful clean and always on time Living in your home through construction can be a little bothersome and disturbing Not to mention that you have no privacy but SOD Home Group crew gave us as much privacy as possible and also disturbed me as little as possible since we work from home since this COVID started The quality and craftsmanship they provided is just superb If you are looking for an honest and trustworthy contractor definitely call SOD home Group Oren and the team made what we thought would be a horrible experience into a marvelous easygoing well certainly be contacting them down the road for all my remodeling projects
5,I took 5 estimates for our remodeling project that included the garage kitchen 2 bathrooms SOD Home Group was by far the fairest bid and the most knowledgeable contractor Oren was my project manager Unlike one of the other contractors who completely disregarded my ideas Oren listened to my ideas and helped me realize them The project ran into some delays as Oren worked to clear through permitting challenges Thank goodness that Oren was so diligent in resolving those challenges Oren and I were in constant contact from the beginning of the year until midJuly when the job was completed and I mean constant communication daily The consistent communication was also very appreciated At the end of the day I felt I could trust Oren and that is a truly rare thing If you need help with any remodeling project give these guys a call  they are good
5,The best way I can explain my experience with this company is that everything was done marvelously One thing Oren promised us from day one is that we will get custom work Thats exactly what we received  custom remodeling in all matters of the project Oren helped us hire a custom cabinet maker They did custom kitchen cabinets linen closets and our bathroom vanities Next we needed custom doors and windows since our house was so old and we had to fit all sizes so once again Oren helped us hire a custom door and window maker Since we have a large space and the flooring runs through pretty much both top and bottom level and we didnt want to rip out the old woods we had to hire someone to make us new custom flooring to match the old one that they had put in close to 90 years ago We also ended up redoing all of our electric lines plumbing lines drain lines and gas lines Oren helped us hire a plaster specialist who could duplicate the plaster texture that they had done many years ago He also could help us find the company to duplicate the old plaster base and ceiling molding Because this was such an old house and large house we had to get the right contractor to do custom remodeling work Oren could find us all the local specialists who work in older homes and can duplicate the quality and craftsmanship of what they had used earlier on We had a lot of woodwork which needed to be customized not just installation but also custom making the actual moldings from scratch One of the best things about Oren was that he had the answers to a lot of our questions But what I like most about him is that he didnt get scared of a challenge and in fact pursuited headon If there was something that he didnt know he wouldnt just say well thats not my problem He would help us find the right person or company to do that Im truly grateful that we could find Oren and his company to help us renovate this property The house looks marvelous but the best thing about it is that you cant tell that it was done now it still looks like it was built 100 years ago What Oren could do for us was that he gave us great ideas to keep the old charm of the house but still update the house where we have a smart home and smart thermostat and the ability to control a lot of different aspects from our phones or tablets I truly believe that we spent a premium on this renovation But it was definitely worth it because the house looks marvelous and the property values since we have done the renovation have gone through the roof Oren was definitely the most expensive contractor that we had interviewed but he was also the most understanding and the most caring Also another great thing about him was that he was always accessible to us Whether we called him texted him or emailed him he would always get back to us immediately I have heard of horror stories from other clients and contractors Im glad that this was not our experience
5,Ive been through my share of remodels and almost all the experiences took more time more moneyyou know the story And then my mothers condo had water damage which was uninhabitable Despite solid insurance the moment the tests came back positive for mold and sewage we knew this was going to be a complete move out demo and remodel I had 5 bids come back and chose Oren with SOD Hoe Group He and his team are my heroes Open communication direct eye contact honest opinions quick problem solving and most of all they took care of us when COVID hit and the building shut down to all contractors Even though we had weeks left on our schedule to get the job done I could have the Board give us 5 days so that my mother could move back in and they made it happen with no changes to the original renderings Orens communication was impeccable with immediate responses to every question and request The craftsmanship is PERFECTION Thank you Oren
5,We started our complete remodeling project by remodeling the kitchen and bathrooms and because it went much better than we expected we remodeled all the other sections of the house front and back yard pool garage and more Oren helped us to select all the finishing materials and fixtures that we needed for the entire remodeling and his workers worked every day and they completed the project on time Our huge remodeling project went so well that the house got a fresh look and feel Oren and the rest of the team did a very professional job and we are very pleased with the results We recommend them to anyone considering a remodeling project
5,Oren and his team at SOD Home Group were beyond excellent regarding my home remodeling project They were thorough detailed and kept me informed regarding most of the important parts of the remodeling the entire time I am mainly pleased with the fresh look and open space of our house which got a fresh look and wide open space It didnt matter to us but there was a bit of a disconnect between the sales pitch timeline and the actual timeline for the demo and installation I wanted quality and thats what I got
5,SOD Home Group made our long time vision come true Overall we knew what we wanted when we decided to relandscape our front and back yard but going from head to paper to reality doesnt always happen mainly because we wanted too much that at the end would not look good Lucky for us Oren with his exceptional experience and knowledge could make it happen Orens knowledge as an arborist made it easy for us to communicate our ideas while taking advantage of his design expertise He was creative in working with our budget his expert crew was hardworking conscientious and respectful of Covid protocol and Oren continues to follow up to make sure our garden is thriving We could not be happier with our new front yard and are looking forward to having SOD Home Group back for future projects
5,We have been dreaming for a few years about how we will design the kitchen what will it have and how it will serve us We wanted it to be and look no less than perfect We worked closely with Mr Oren on the initial design which after a few corrections and meetings become the final one and he gave us many beautiful ideas and solutions to select from and to have as part of the remodeling At the end we are happy very much with his design work time frame to finish the remodeling job and his super happy personality Oren is a pleasure person to work with He always made sure that our vision of what we want will matches what he can do and now we are in love with the new kitchen Very high skilled company and we recommend to anyone that in case they want any beautiful remodeling job with a truly honest company and excellent customer support they will have to contact this company
5,I highly recommend Oren SOD Home Group He is very knowledgeable answered all my questions and more very professional and responsive He spent over 3 hours showing me all the possibilities that can be done to my kitchen if you know little about all the little details about remodeling your home like I do he will explain it to you in terms that you will completely understand and turns your ideas into this beautiful 3D design Oren also had great ideas and recommendations on how to attain your dream home He knows house histories and why houses were built in a certain way He is unlike any other contractor that will just throw out random price of how much the renovation could cost you without showing you hard proof Im a visual learner so when Oren made this amazing 3D design using the exact measurement of my kitchen it blew my mind It even gave me a chance to actually change few things that did not quite look right with kitchen Most importantly he will make sure you will enjoy and have fun designing your home Oren you are the best
5,We are really proud and happy to give this rating and review to SOD Home Group based on our excellent experience with Oren the team of people who worked at our house and the company We really value his professionalism Oren proved us to be very honest quick understanding person and mainly good listener based on the fact that he made it happen with our budget Oren heard our concerns and goals and was very realistic about what to expect for taking on an addition project Oren also provided us with several additional ideas that we didnt know we can implement them at all We decided to hire Oren and his team immediately after we went over his estimate and 3D drawings of the remodeling project Now that they finished our addition remodeling project 6 months after we can write clearly that we highly recommend Oren for any major projects for your home
5,We hired SOD Home Group to handle a large remodel of my home Oren and his crew removed a large loadbearing wall and reworked my old living room and kitchen into an open concept floor plan He also had some great ideas to cleanly route our TVmedia equipment into the new coat closet that he built for us Ultimately all of our concerns and requests were addressed My husband and I panicked when our new hardwood floors were incredibly squeaky and he had his subcontractors come back to fix the problem When our new kitchen cabinets from Home Depot arrived crooked his company expertly solved the issue On top of that Oren was able to complete our project several weeks earlier than we were hoping We are expecting to hire Oren again when we will be ready to execute our next home renovation project
5,We had creative SOD home Group redo all of our home and due to the COVID19 it took longer then we thought it would but the final remodeling work is stunning My husband was very specific about what he wanted and Oren with his professional teams were able to deliver it beyond our expectations Working with Oren was very easy straightforward and they were always professional What made this remodeling safe and well was that Oren made sure that each day the teams will clean as much as they could and that they will wear masks and gloves while working We dont think that we will ever going to use any other contractor after having such a significant experience with them They are definitely our go to
5,Oren and his crew just finished the complete remodeling of our new home The work took several months and during this time they remodeled each space including the kitchen bathrooms bedrooms entry etc Oren started with the 3D design and after we agreed on that phase he came up with execution plan including the prices The work was managed by him daily and according to the schedule that he planned for us They informed us on every step of the work while Oren made sure that the price will remain within the agreed budget We really love the new remodeling and our home got a brand fresh look We highly recommend Oren and each one of his crew for any remodeling project

5,SOD Home Group did a major renovation in our home removing two loadbearing walls holding the second floor remodeling our kitchen the downstairs bathroom family room and the roof a complete remodel Their price was the second highest out of the five estimates we got but I was looking for a contractor to provide a high quality and hassle free remodel I really appreciated the communication via the WhatsApp Oren installed on my phone which made our communication throughout the design stage and the actual project very easy There were a few minor hiccups with the color of the grout and some other final finishing but Oren took care of them to our satisfaction SOD Home Group is definitely for those who want a thorough professional contractor that provides a highquality hassle free remodel
5,We contracted with SOD Home Group to totally update and remodel a large part of our house that basically included the hallway complete Kitchen guest bathroom and 2 additional bathrooms and bedrooms Oren was honest about the work and gave us a very realistic estimate and a time frame of the completion date for the entire work at our house This was an excellent plus because all the other contractors that we brought in to our house were just trying to get the remodeling job signed and would probably up charge us later Oren was very communicative from the first day and a very easy person to reach if we had any question or concern about the work progress or even if we were interesting in a minor change The teams of workers were respectful and efficient mainly since we had to complete the job during this COVID19 timing and to move in with the family during the process While there were some issues that raised during the work Oren could get the remodeling job completed and were thrilled with our new home This was really our first and largest remodeling project so we felt it went as smoothly as possible Our only issue was the tiles we ended up choosing for the floor and shower were not the best quality We wish that had been flagged to us sooner since we spent a small fortune on the remodel but the bathroom looks beautiful and wed highly recommend shopping around for tile
5,We went over many estimates for our complete ADU project we needed to do since we work from home because of COVID The Addition included kitchen and a small bathroom We hesitate on who should we hire for this as we know stories when the remodeling projects not finished or done correctly All the contractors we met were too pushy to make us sign and we didnt want to move forward with anyone because of that We met Oren from SOD Home Group he was very friendly professional and accessible throughout the entire project He really did a fabulous work from the design to the demolition and finally the installation His team came every day and they completed the work on the promised time Oren has done the best remodeling in my house handsdown And we will definitely contact him soon to also renovate our other house Trust friendliness and professionalism are absolutely what you will get when choosing this company
5,SOD Home Group was strongly recommended to me by a coworker who stated that the company was exceptionally reliable and did a quality job At first I thought their price was a bit high but because of the recommendation I chose to hire them to remodel my entire house They were great from start to finish I was worried about bringing a team into the house during COVID but they were great They wore masks they were super respectful and treated my house as a living space and not as a construction zone The crew was extremely courteous and kind One of the major reasons I chose to hire SOD Home Group was because I was assured by Oren the company owner that he will manage my project directly and that he would be involved in all stages of the project Oren stood by his word and made sure to always keep me updated throughout all the stages of my project He made sure I was always aware of the upcoming schedule and verified that I always had all the required materials to keep the project running smoothly and seamlessly The quality of work came out as expected stunning The Kitchen and bathrooms were completely transformed and I feel like I am living in a brand new home I am so impressed with Oren and SOD Home Group This project came out better than I could have ever imagined and I couldnt be happier
5,Oren and the guys at SOD Home Group did a stellar job on our big home remodeling project We added a second story to our Los Angeles home nearly doubling it in size We also moved a kitchen and living room wall and completely gutted our kitchen We basically rebuilt the entire home while doing our best to change the character of our homeWe had tried to start this process several years back running into snags and unethical contractors along the way and are so happy that we landed in the capable hands of this team At every step along the way we felt honestly communicated with and cared for on a personal level Besides this all the subcontractors they worked with were topnotch and considerate of our neighbors Not only did they do a remarkable job and make our house the talk of the neighborhood they went above and beyond to really be sure we were always 100 happy with all the work being done Even with the pandemic hitting right in the middle of our project they finished within our original timeline as promised I would without a doubt recommend them for any project you have large or small Im attaching a few photos to show the scale of our undertaking Enjoy
5,I hired Oren and SOD to do a major construction and remodel project back in 2015 We received a number of bids and went with SOD bc they were most competitive organized and responsive Oren took the time to understand our project and vision for the remodel He said once youre a customer youre always a customer and stayed true to that statement The project progressed according to schedule which is rare for a project of this size My 3rd party architect made some mistakes not SODs fault that resulted in change orders permit delays and additional expenses  which Oren ultimately waived in good faith The project ultimately finished on time and according to budget Were now 5 years later and Oren is still committed to make it right without question as issues arise
5,We hired Oren the contractor for ADU Garage Conversion We went with him and his team on such a large remodeling project because he is the specialist in that area They also gave me very competitive price Oren and his team were a real pleasure to work with Oren and the team that worked at our house were always on time respectful disciplined and responsible The project was finished ahead of the promised schedule and outcome is great Big thanks to Oren very honest and helpful person Highly recommend SOD Home Group

5,"I have hired SOD Builders on major repair and renovation project for my damaged house that got damaged after a fire damage The customer service and attention that I got from this company and mainly from the actual people that worked at my house was outstanding and I would highly recommend them with my eyes closed to anyone that need to any remodel any house that have this type of damage Here is with my own words of why and what they did at my house that caused me to write this review and recommendation about them 
aHonest  ethical From the first time I called them till the moment the final payment was done I noticed that all they care was to make sure to do the work on the best side and not to try and find reasons to earn more and more money During the work itself there were additional problems that were found and most of them were taken care of without even letting me know or to try and charge me for additional money
bBudget  The work was divided to 2 sections section 1 was for the first time they arrived to my house and tried to save as much as possible things And the second time was for the complete work that needed to be done in order to make the house as a living house In both things the amount that was set was fixed and didnt changed and more than that On the second stage the budget that was set didnt raised or included any hidden charges
cOntime They give realistic timeframes and realistic quotes They may not the cheapest or fastest but you can be sure and confident that theyre costs will be reasonable and that they will complete the job without any hesitation or concern when they promise and within budget
dGreat working skills and extremely ethical working people The people at SOD Builders were able to provide me with excellent ideas about the new repairs Because of the damages I have the opportunity to redesign the kitchen mainly and the first floor of the house
eGreat people The company assigned to my house several people that did the actual work and they were managed and supervised by Oren Oren was the most serious person that we dealt from the company and all he cared was to make sure that the work is being done on the most perfect side and without any problem The rest of the people were excellent people"
5,We were satisfied with our previous contractor who remodeled our master bathroom but this time he wasnt available to do it due to some family reasons and we wanted to remodel the rest of the bathrooms including the kitchen so we started to make our research and to find a good contractor Our neighbor hired SOD Builders recently and he showed us his remodeled bathroom and it was amazing so we asked for the phone number of SOD Builders We called them and spoke to Christin who was very nice to us she was able to schedule the meeting with Oren and to start the work within a week and a half after The price was fair and we hired them The remodeling project took 8 weeks which was within a promised time frame They did a very good job and the quality of all the finished products were at highest level and it looks beautiful We truly cant ask for more Very Professional contractor We will recommend and hire their service again  for sure

5,The entire project that included so many item at my house was designed and managed by Gal of SOD builders with a design that was created by input from me and installed by his several professional teams The project contained the full remodeling of the kitchen dining room and living room All new cabinets from diamond cabinets were installed red hardwood floors custom cut marble counter tops back splash new appliances under counter sink and all the rest of the items that required for this remodeling project The entire remodeling work took about 7 weeks from beginning to end and I was able to live in the house during the whole work The construction teams were so professional and reliable and made sure to do everything according to the plan while Gal managing and monitoring the daily and weekly tasks and making sure that they are coming out in perfect condition They also made always sure to clean at the end of each day At the end of the project I must say that the project had a fabulous outcome and is certainly a top quality I dont feel I could have had a better outcome from any other contractor It was just great
5,They were on time and set us up exactly as we requested We have been planning to expand our back yard and living space and now our new fire pit area makes everything flow completely into each other We just love our new back yard
5,SOD builders is an excellence home remodeling company that for sure will works very hard for their clients We have met with Adam on our large scale remodeling project at our new house that we recently purchased In the past we hired him on some remodeling projects and we were very happy with his work while this time is no difference and he was able to bring to life our vision and design He was very committed to our project and we noticed how much he cares for everything His work with his crew was very tight and it worked like a charm No problem or issue was left alone during the work and each part of the work was ended only after he physically checked it and approved it Our large scale remodeling was to remodel the kitchen bedrooms and bathrooms The kitchen needed to be redesigned and Adam came up with some great ideas that left the house in an open space design that each section of it was separate from the other one while in the meantime there was no large walls that showed the separation The work was completed after 2 months of a day by day work and each day we had at least 6 people working together at the house each one on a different section We are very happy with the complete results of the work and we want to thank them all here in this review Thank you Adam and everyone who was involved in our house remodeling
5,Allen at SOD builders done wonders at my home I needed several projects to be done and I just could not decide where to start I wanted to upgrade the kitchen and bathrooms and to upgrade the living room area So I asked around all my friends  family for any referral and one of my friends referred Allen to me Because it was a big remodeling that involved a lot of money I searched and checked about him and his company before hiring him and paid my hardearned money On my first meeting with Allen I was the one that did most of the talking and he just listened and took his notes about my taste goals and more Allen helped me to prioritize what to start first which was a huge help to organize my thoughts and to understand that it is better to start with something but to do it on the best side So after that meeting I decided to remodel the living room bathroom and kitchen area Allen planned and helped me with all the stages of this work and he even went with me personally to select materials The only minus thing that happened was that the finishing date did not end on the scheduled date which is ok and normal for this size of remodeling The quality of work craftsmanship and perfection in the design  completion on top of the service that I got was remarkable I always got answers to my questions and comments All the involved workers and subcontractors came on time each day and never caused any problem Allen had always found the time to pass by and check their work and progress There were some problems during the work but Allen and all the workers were there to address it right away and solve it I know I could not achieve that results of my work with any other Company So thank you Allen for the wonderful job  until the next remodeling
5,Oren and his skilled team of professionals made our dream remodeling of kitchen living room and laundry room From our first appointment with Oren continued to the demolition stage all the way to the completion of the work the whole team and involved people of SOD builders were expert honest highly motivated people and well organized Any issue that was raised along the way was addressed correctly and handled in a professional manner and we were always informed of the progress deliveries and installations of our project We must state that our remodeling project was also priced right and our price didnt change during the remodeling This was something very important for us and we are happy that it stayed that way We felt like we were in great hands and we will definitely call on them again for any future projects
5,I have not had the pleasure of hiring Ehud at SOD builders for upgrading my landscape plantings build a new fire pit with seating area replace all the existing backyard floor with new stamp concrete one Adding an awning system that will be useful during summer time and mainly to add a nice BBQ spot I was very happy with SOD builders and I was a somehow concerned how this whole work will come out After the first few days of the actual work I knew that the work will be done on the best side and Ehud will deliver exactly what I wanted My backyard is now done and it has never looked so beautiful than it is right now Ehud did a wonderful job and his planning and understanding what I want was fully worth it More than that Ehud spent almost a week with us to find the right materials for this work and this part was the worst part BUT at the end I appreciated all the time and affords that he put into this part of the work Ehud was really on top of everything and he did so much just to see how Im pleased and happy with the work and progress All the people that did the actual work were easygoing resourceful and skilled and were willing to spend the extra time by making sure that perfection will be the right definition for the work they do and they always found the time to talk with me about issues or problems that happened The cost for this awesome project was very reasonable I do recommend anyone to hire and use SOD builders
5,During the years and each time we moved to a new house we have hired many contractors and we did had satisfied results with most of them so we knew what to look for when we need to hire a good contractor when we need one SOD builders was one of the contractors that we hired in the past and we were very happy with them and they were top notch with excellent results As soon as we hired them this time the remodeling project passed all of our expectations We hired them to remodel our backyard and kitchen including the replacement and installation of 5 windows that 1 of them required them to expand the wall in order to create a new balcony sliding door Before the work started Allen and the office staff ordered all the materials and they started the work like a week before they all arrived to the house The first thing that started the work was the demolition of the existing spaces framing plumbing electrical new cabinets upper and lower lighting fixtures stamp concrete on the back yard part tile drywall new paint and the installation of all the appliances They worked fast professionally and flawlessly Every day we noticed a change in the progress and the workers came on time and they stayed until they finished the daily tasks We never had any complaint or problem with anyone that was involved at the remodeling project The new kitchen was completed on time within the budget and in a professional manner We love the new kitchen and the stamp concrete in the back yard
5,When we hired SOD builders to remodel the kitchen at our house we were told by the people who referred us to them that they would stay on schedule and for sure on budget Since we had 1 bad experience with our previous contractor we were hesitating to believe it Adam and his subcontractors were without any doubt the most skilled honest trusty and reliable people we have ever met They were polite and respectful to the fact that we were living in the house during the work and they made sure we were ok with everything The remodeling spaces were neatly cleaned at the end of every day and left as little dust as possible in the rest of the house Everything they did was approved by us prior on a daily basis to be sure we were all on the same page All and any issue that came up during the work were addressed right away in a professional way Adam and his contractors are truly the best in terms of workmanship reliability and honesty
5,We had our bathrooms remodeled by SOD builders just recently Our master bathroom was the most major turnaround from all the other bathrooms that we did Our supervisor Adam among his team of people with his subcontractors were professional and productive Adam worked hand by hand with us to reach an amazing results His ideas and participation along with our spoken requirements ended in a really overwhelming results Adam was able to generate for us a before  after designs so we can fell the transformation of how it will be after the work is complete The work was performed while we were living at the house and their work was not interfering our day to day things They worked clean and they made sure to protect all the spaces to prevent any type of damages The work was done in a continuous manner with Adam regularly checking all phases of the job as it advanced Punctuality was a main feature with him We would have no doubts in referring him to anyone looking for an honest and reliable contractor
5,From the first consultation meeting that we had with Adam all the way to the final walk thru of the remodeling project that was done by him and his crew Adam was a great person to work with The work that he did for us A complete kitchen remodeling bathrooms remodeling laundry room upgrade and the 2 car garage was done in fairly time and with high standards of quality Every one of the crew members made sure that their part in the work was done to the high standards of the rest of craftsmanship that was defined and managed by Adam During the remodeling project we were provided with all the relevant information including solutions to raised problems that came up and all of our questions were answered in a professionally manner Now that our project is complete and after working with Adam at SOD builders we are sure that our house will serve our needs for many more years to come
5,SOD builders just finished a major kitchen remodeling project for us Adam removed all the old floor and replaced it with new ¾ hardwood floor On top of that he refaced all the kitchen cabinets took down a wall including some cabinets that were between the kitchen and living room and added a new overhead beam The old countertop was also removed and a new marble countertop have been installed and polished The dishwasher was relocated and replaced with a new stainless steel one In the electric part of the remodeling we relocate several electrical switches and outlets and installed an overhead exhaust fan We are very pleased and satisfied with all the work that Adam and his people did for us Adam is careful easy person to talk to and he did his best to keep the functionality of the kitchen for us as much as he could during the remodel Everyone appeared at the house on time and mainly were focused only on the project The kitchen was completed on time but only due to the fact that they also worked extra time on Sundays too just to stay on time More than that during the remodeling we came across few problems with the plumbing and electricity but Adam was on top of it with the electrician and plumber so those issues were solved at no time Adams schedule is pretty full but now we know how worth is the wait We will not think twice to hire them again We are very proud to write this review
5,We are very proud and happy to write this great review for Oren and the whole team at SOD builders We decided to select SOD builders out of 6 other home improvement companies that we met and talked to in regards to our home remodeling project We much mention here that the other 2 companies were too rough and pushy people that all they wanted is to just make the sale and to have us signed on the contact which was the reason why we ended up not hiring them This type of work was a big no for us and never want to deal with this type of people or companies Oren was the exact opposite from that and his approach was first to understand what we want and what is our vision in regards to the kitchen and bathrooms that we wanted to have After he understood that he provided us with his ideas that were in fact nothing less than improvements on that and this was enough for him to come up with a 3D design that reflected the entire concept Our kitchen and bathrooms came out much better than the definition of Stunning and this is exactly what we wanted to get from anyone that we hired for our house All the workers came to our house each day and on time while focusing on perfection and daily tasks stayed on the agreed budget and schedule We WILL hire them again for sure in the future for any home improvement project that we may have High recommendations and perfect references Great office staff and supervision
5,Based on my recent experience with Adam with my kitchen remodeling I can only write that I will recommend SOD builders to everyone I know Prior for me hiring them I got 3 other estimates and Adam was definitely my guy from the moment we ended our second meeting about the project Adam was quick qualified and easygoing Before I wanted to go ahead with my remodeling I knew more or less what I want to do and how I would like it to be done Adam was very communicative and patient during the meetings and he heard everything I wanted to do and need even though it wasnt an easy task My kitchen space is medium size and had a lot of potential Adam was able to implement most of my things and mostly to fit it within my budget During my remodeling I wanted to do some things that were out of his comfort zone Adam connected me with his vendor who was able to do them as well and I was very happy for that as well If I could write any word for my experience with SOD builders and mainly Adam it would be WONDERFUL
5,I hired SOD builders for designing and do all the construction work for the front and backyard of my new house Avi and his team were professional more than responsible and they put a lot of attention to details and perfection during the whole work Avi was extremely communicative and reactive he always answered all the questions I had and he worked with me hand by hand to design plan and deliver all of the things that I wanted to have for my landscaping project His team was regularly at the home from start to finish And the entire team at SOD builders made no hesitation to make sure that I was happy and pleased with the work they did The company kept stuck to my budget and any change that could increase that number was conditioned to my approval Avi showed me all the available options that I can have prior of me making any choices from hardscape to plant selection and placement of features This is a really devotion and this company have honesty and they do look and care to make sure that customers comes first and primary before making the money  The whole team were creative in a way that they passionately shaped the backyard from an empty lot and converted it into a gorgeous outdoor living space that perfectly work for my family and friends I would recommend them for sure over and over again and I will hire them again when we need any additional work done

5,We found SOD builders while they were working on a remodeling project in another house on the neighborhood During that work I approached the supervisor Allen and we asked him to see the work After we saw what did do and how beautiful it is we asked him to pass by our house and to see what we want to do and to give us a quote for the work We wanted to remodel the kitchen and bathroom and also to paint the entire house Allen came over and saw our house He then went back to his office and did his homework including a 3D design Dew days after he called us and set an additional meeting with us to show us his ideas and prices The remodeling project started a week after we agreed and signed all the documents and it took them less than a month to complete it Allen did a wonderful work and he was able to implement most of the things we wanted The kitchen came out beautiful and very functional while the bathroom got his new look and design The final touch was the paint of the house which gave us a brand new look of the entire house The whole remodeling was done in a very professionally manner Allen put a lot of attention to all the details of the work Thanks to Allen and entire crew that worked including the office staff for making our house look great
5,We couldnt be happier with the remodeling job that was made for us by SOD builders under the supervision of Ehud Ehud met with us several times before we hired him and he talked with us till he understood completely our goals and what we were trying to achieve with our remodeling Ehud really listened and helped us finalize our project so it will fit with our opportunities and budget This approach of Ehud gave us more trust in him and it was different from other contractors that we met because their approach was too rough for us and we didnt like it at all Ehud was also very familiar with the city codes and regulations which saved a lot of time in drawing up the designs and money as well Based on our meetings with Ehud the office staff was able to come up with a wonderful 3D design which included most of our things and all we needed to do was to give it few touches till it was exactly what we wanted The remodeling team and the subcontractors were also professionals and polite while they gave a lot of attention to our schedule and preferences In general the whole team deserves this great review for the quality of the work they did for us Our remodeling project was now a large one but the time and affords SOD builders put into it made us feel as very special clients
5,We recently hired Gal at SOD builders for a complete renovation of our kitchen 2 bathrooms and master bedroom Besides the fact that Gal not only finished the entire renovation on time and on budget but the quality of it was more than wonderful and beat by far our hopes Gal and the whole team including the subcontractors were so skilled and available during the work and made it easy for us to stay living at the house while they were working They were mainly careful with everything and they cleaned the working space daily and made sure it will be as safe as possible not just at the end of the work The most and important thing was that Gal answered each and every question or concern we had during the work and he always made sure that we were happy with each and any task of the work as they were installed More than that Gal and his crew were able to deal very professionally with any of the several surprises that came up during the work and they solved them always with minimizing our stress We truly in love with all the remodeling that they did and with the fact that it was such an easy and stressful process that we are already considering how and what we will remodel in our next project
5,Oren from SOD builders was hired to create our dream house We renovated two bathrooms added an additional bathroom  laundry room and installed hardwood floors in all the bedrooms We worked mainly with Oren Oren was always reachable and reactive He was creative and unbelievable from the design stage all the way to the actual construction All of their workers and subcontractors were generous respectful hardworking people with high reliability Their cabinet maker person did beautiful work and was a pleasure to work with During the work there was a mold behind the old cabinets and our concern was that it will cause a major delay with the work Oren made sure to take care of it with one of his vendors and they were tremendously helpful by solving that problem and keeping the project on track The mold problem was an addition in price but Oren was able to get us the best deal with the mold remediation Now that the remodeling is over we can say that a lots of extra things were done for us and without any additional charge A lot of them were just being done without even asking us Oren was able to finalize the remodeling under budget and a little bit early than expected Our house was treated as if it was their own We are very pleased with the remodeling they did in the interior aspect of our house that we are currently in advance stage to work with them on the backyard and pool We highly recommend selecting SOD builders for any project
5,We hired SOD builders to create an outdoor patio living space on our home Oren and his workers were professional organized and very polite offered a project plan had an onsite project manager Oren and a team of wellseasoned personable and talented subcontractors who had worked together for years They were trustworthy and communicated well throughout the entire project There were never any surprises to the budget process and all was welldocumented and shared throughout the progress of our project We were able to work together as a team sharing ideas making any adjustments and the results are a gorgeous outdoor space for my family to enjoy We have great respect for Oren and Jacob And here is another example of how they stand behind their work they just contacted us for a follow up even though the work has been completed few months ago They wanted to have a walk through the addition to review any issues that may have arisen over the year since construction was completed so they could be fixed I dont know any contractor that offer such things to his clients We will use SOD builders for all the other renovations we plan to do in our home We know they will exceed our expectations on those too
5,The house that we purchased is very nice and was not maintained for a while before we purchased it The kitchen and the two bathrooms were too old and needed to have a complete renovation Although we knew that beforehand since the property was below value we didnt fully grasp the extent Our main concern was that we had a limited budget for any of the repairs that we wanted to do We were afraid that the repairs that we want to do will be too expensive and much more above the amount that we could afford However after investing a great amount of time in research we realized the budget can be stretched right if we will find the right contractor We have called a several contractors to come by and to give us a proposal for the remodeling of the kitchen and the 2 bathrooms SOD builders was by far the best estimate for the remodeling  It was a little over our budget but we were happy to put up the extra money because we really liked the designs they gave us Signing with Oren was very easy and after that was done Oren was able to start the work immediately within few days Oren was on site nearly every day making sure everything is going well and according to the plan The work crew came in each day and even when the weather turned bad and was extremely hot We were surprised to find how neatly they made the remodeling site Each day when they finish the work for the day they would clean up and prepare the space for the next working day This made it really easy to walk around my house without bumping into things They installed brand new marble counter tops in the kitchen new cabinets and floor tiles The bathrooms got a new coat of paint double sided vanity and counter top All of it fit comfortably with our budget Everything looks new and even better than the rest of the house Hopefully that will be remodeled soon too and when it does I will definitely hire SOD builders again
5,We hired SOD builders to perform a big remodeling of our home The team and the subcontractors that did the actual work were professional dependable and knew exactly what to do under the supervision of Oren and his foreman The work went smoothly at least as we know and they were able to complete the work on time and without increasing the original budget which to us it means a lot because it shows how professional this company is Every job in that scale has problems and issues that coming up during the work and as soon as walls are being taken down and to our opinion the main key is to have a good company that can deals with them as they were minor issues or problems and this can be achieved only by really professional ones SOD builders staff and mainly Oren were always there to respond andor to provide a solution for anything that came across during the work We are extremely happy with the final results of this project and we will recommend them to anyone who would like to do a new construction project or just to remodel any part of their house
5,After meeting in person and interviewing 4 construction companies and general contractors we went ahead and hired SOD builders to do a major remodeling project at our house We selected Oren because he had a great vision for design while implementing our ideas and wish list into the actual remodeling Oren was also gave us a fair price for that work and we felt that we are in a good hands Oren was able to provide us a detailed budget and mainly to give us a good schedule time for our remodeling work based on what we wanted to have During our meetings with Oren he was able to help us decide about some difficult design issues Our project foreman Michael was very pleasant person to deal with Michael and Oren were very communicative with us and were able to answer all the questions we had during the work and even before we start and while they were working at the house we got from them a weekly updates on the progress of the project and of each stage of it All the concerns or problems that came up during the work were quickly solved During the work Oren brought to the house several subcontractors like electrician plumber etc All of them were nice people and all they wanted was to do their part on the best side and under the quality rules of Oren The work was finished a little bit over the schedule time that was assigned by Oren but most important it was under the budget The house turned out to be so beautiful and much more pleasant to be in We will hire Oren and his crew again and we will definitely refer them to anyone planning a remodel
5,After questioning several construction companies to repair and renew our kitchen we were very impressed with SOD builders and are glad we hired them Before retaining SOD builders we questioned and appraised estimates that we received from other possible contractors Most of them werent able to work around our ideas and visions for the kitchen design There was something lacking in His presentation or they didnt represent His companies or themselves as professionals who were willing to hear us Most of the plans were designed on kitchen remodeling prototypes containing cabinets mounted in a straight line They didnt grasp the concept of our kitchen and the end result we were trying to achieve Oren Harel changed all that He presented himself as professional honest dedicated to provide us with an excellence product His work just proved to be very reliable by doing so Oren was always willing to listen take his time to really understand our ideas and to help us come up with the right plan for our dream kitchen It was obvious that his professional history and experience gave him the ability to imagine our own vision He had the ability to start with the end product in mind The original contract was well prepared well offered fully clarified and easy to understand His demonstrations were professional and each stage of the remodeling project was exactly as described His performance to meet that end was evident in the working relationship that he had with his subcontractors All the subcontractors that were working with SOD builders Construction in our remodeling were outstanding professional and openminded for every step of the way We easily came to trust on the SOD builders capabilities Any question or concern that surfaced Oren was able to take care of it immediately If a change was required we reviewed the amendment before signing the updated proposal All these acts took place prior to starting any part of work Oren was a huge asset to us He was compassionate about our condition He was always on time showed up when he said he would He called when he said he would Oren was working hand by hand with all the subcontractors And seriously involved with each days work and he always was on top of the daily construction needs or necessities Oren was the kind of person who was welcomed into our home He was forwardlooking at all times He was creative trustworthy very qualified and true to his word Once we started working with him we knew that we had hired the right companyperson He did everything he said he was going to do He didnt cut any corner We would trust SOD builders with any project and without reservation recommend the company to anyone
5,I was very pleased with the work and service that was provided by Oren Oren and his team of workers remodeled my master bedroom by replacing the carper installing a custom fireplace paint the room and remodel the master bathroom by replacing all the tiles vanity fixtures and plumbing Oren is very attentive to details and perfection He did a great job by supervising his people on a daily basis His total price was very competitive compared to other contractors and mainly there was no hidden charges at the end of the remodeling and his quality of work was exactly what I expected to get for my money I will recommend him to family and friends as I have been getting a lot of compliments for the work he did Before Oren start to work at my house he brought many samples of materials such as tiles and paint and lots of pictures which made the process flow and very easily Also his staff were very consistent by making sure that all my needs have been met He will be my first choice when I will decide to remodel my kitchen as my next project Thank you Oren and SOD builders
5,Our kitchen was a bit too small and uncomfortable because of a separating wall that was between the kitchen to the dining area so we wanted to make it bigger and lighter and mostly to have the feeling of open space that will enlarge the space since we have the long windows and sliding doors by the dining area  This remodeling was set in my mind for a while so I needed to put it in action  I was just afraid it wouldnt be what I have in mind but SOD builders remodeled it the way I really wanted and expected to have The moment Oren took down the separation wall at the kitchen the space become so much bigger with so much light I also wanted to replace the tile with wood floor and on the walls to have a nice tiles as back splash Oren was able to get a great deal for all the materials and the big light creamy color ceramic tile on the floor with a really nice design with some stainless steel appliances and light grey pieces on the walls Everything was going to look way too nice comparing to the cabinets so new dark brown wood cabinets were done too I love my kitchen now and will use them in near future for sure
5,When we hired Oren from SOD builders we liked that we dealt directly with the owners and no unprofessional salesman who work for commission and keep trying to push in order to sign the contract now and add as many items as he could knowing that we dont know much about construction After we met with Oren and his supervisor at our house their attitude and their interest to know what we would like to have and how we imagine our new kitchen to look like etc we felt very comfortable and we scheduled the second meeting so we can see the design of the new kitchen and what Oren included in the new kitchen in regards to storage space and appliances I must admit that this guys Oren and his supervisor David are definitely professional people and they have a great level of understanding and listening The new design included all the features that we wanted to have and the total price was near the budget that we set at the first meeting They total price for kitchen remodeling was about 10 18 less than all other 3 contractors that came to our house in order to do the same kitchen that we did with SOD builders The job was done in a record time so clean so smooth exactly as promised
5,"I fully recommend SOD builders Oren and his team completed two remodels for our home in Tehachapi The first remodel included two custom bathrooms in 2014 The bathrooms were designed by Michelle The designer in SOD builders Michelle works on many projects with Oren Michelle highly recommended Oren for topnotch quality We found Orens team to be extremely knowledgeable professional and trustworthy Although the project took a bit longer than anticipated it was well worth the wait as the results are impeccable We worked with Michelle and Oren again in for this remodeling on a much larger remodeling which included gutting and totally renovating the kitchen living room and dining room as well as new flooring and interior doors throughout the remainder of the house Shawn Orens cabinet maker customdesigned the quartersawn Oak cabinets  amazing attention to detail Shawn as well as all of Orens team are excellent craftsmen Oren the supervisor of our remodel suggested we vault the living room ceilings this was not in the original plans however these ceilings transformed the room without adding square footage 
Orens work is topnotch you get what you pay for Do it right the first time We really love our new home and we would highly recommend SOD builders and his team"
5,I wanted to take the time and to express my experience and appreciation of the work that was done with SOD builders Few months ago we decided that it was finally the time to remodel all the bathrooms at the house 3 in total We search and looked either online or by asking our friends and family in case they know a company that is worth to hire After several recommendations and good search results we came across SOD builders and we were impressed by their online site and past projects From what we saw and heard we decided to call them and to get more information about what we want to do and to hopefully schedule a face to face meeting and to take it from there To our house arrived Oren and he checked and saw what we would like to achieve and to get from the bathrooms and what is the budget that we can afford The first meeting was very good and few days later we got the estimate for the work and Oren asked to meet with us again in order to go over it and see what can be changed Oren understood exactly what we wanted and he made us feel like I was in very good hands He was firm capable and skilled We really love my new bathrooms and we hope to work with SOD builders in the future
1,"They took our 1000 deposit and never worked on our deck or kitchen  They were going to build our deck then remodel our kitchen for 80k  It didnt happen  They were to work on our deck prior to out kitchen      It took over 1 month for them to respond to us at all after giving them our deposit check for 1k    We kept waiting and waiting for a response but we never received anything from Adam our project manager
Adam came to our house he was a great sales person  He convinced us that a SOD Builder is a fantastic company  My wife had a great rapport with Adam during the initial interviewquote  She mentioned I would travel to his home country Hungry for work   He was excited and asked me questions where I went and how I liked it  He seemed very personal and trust worthy and I was sold
I cut them a check for 1k on April 12016 for a deposit  It was cashed on April 15th 2016  
Adam promised they would start immediately and he would personally be in charge of the project and be able to start the week of April 11th  We were so exited getting a new deck and remolded kitchen   They signed us up for Buildetrendcom  This was a way for us to see the progress of our remodel  I thought we were in the right hands
We sent all the prints for the deck and permits to Adam  The prints for the kitchen and permit were in progress
We scheduled a time Monday April 11th for the foeman to come get an assessment on the Demo of our deck since Adam was the project manager we thought Adam was going to be there too  But to our surprise only Damien subcontractor and another 2 workers were there 
Damien asked for the drawings that we gave to Adam  I was shocked why didnt Adam Project Manager give Damien Sub Contractor plans for our deck  Our architect gave the official prints to Adam  I dont have a copy  I ran scrambling thru emails looking for some type of schematic  I finally found it after 20 mins of looking  our Architect came by 10 mins after  Our Architect was also expecting the SubContractor to have the blue prints  This was totally unprofessional  There was no communication between Adam and the SubContractor 
After Damien left we were told by SOD via Karla  that Adam would oversee the project from the office  He will never be on Site only for emergencies  The interview was the last time I talked to Adam or receive and email from our Project Manager  This was not conveyed to us as the owners  I wish he would have mentioned it during the quoting process  We didnt even get Damiens email address
Back to the story  Now Damien has the plans no work for the rest of the week We try to contact Adam to get pricing on the wood  No contact from Adam from Tuesday Apriil 12 Friday April 15  
Monday April 18th rolls around no work has been done on the Deck no contact from Adam for pricing    We try to contact Adam or anyone from SOD but nothing  No Contact from Adam from Monday April 18th  Friday April 22 

Monday  April 25 rolls around this is the 3rd week NOTHING  has been done to the Deck  NO contact at again from Adam or SOD  Monday April 25  Tuesday April 26th

Tuesday night April 26th Im so frustrated I email again  thru builder trend and finally Angies list  Pleading to get some answers from Adam  All I want is our deck to be started  
On Wednesday morning of April 27 2016 I finally get a response from SOD but they say   I know that Karla and Adam are working on getting the pricing for you They are just trying to collect all the information they need in order to give you an accurate price  Why didnt they call us at all for those 3 weeks  NO contact ignoring our emails
Later in the day Oren Dagan contacts us via Buildertrendcom  He says he wants to start the project next week but he wanted to know
Do you want us to start working on the kitchen at the same time
Do you have the permit ready for the kitchenIs your architect going to do that
Do you have the engineering if needed drawing for the wall removal
Are you ok with us starting the deck already before the kitchen or do you want it all in once
Can you provide me with few days that i can send the carpenter over
Have you chosen your appliances fixtures hardware and etc for the kitchen do you need any help or list of items needed

WTF We talked to Adam about this way in the beginning during the quote  He took lots of notes He even itemized all these items on the agreement that we signed   Its like we are starting all over again All they wanted was their deposit from us 

We were totally frustrated"
5,Oren from SOD builders was our lead contractor for our complete home renovation After the initial design that we got from the architect and speedy construction Oren did a great job by helped us with design of floorings bathrooms light fixtures countertops marble and tile work We know that its hard and rare to find a contractor that have the qualities and abilities that required to create the perfect project but also patient supportive and highly determined to get the remodeling project done Oren the onsite contractor and supervisor did an outstanding work The rooms came out beautiful with open space light and clearly creative while at the same token fits to our style which is warm and personal Because this was the first time we did a home remodeling it was a big deal to us that Oren will be able to absorb our vision for our house in terms of its style realism beauty and potential SOD builders was equal to the task We basically love the new kitchen that Oren designed and implemented at the house the high ceiling in the media room the marble master suite the light engineered wood flooring the amazing molding and the guest bathroom We know that many contractors or construction companies could built our house but what SOD builders can offer is a passion for your home and a promise that they are equal to the task of fulfilling its promise in the absolute standard of honesty and integrity to which they clearly hold themselves
5,"I hired SOD builders to bring the backyard finally to life My house is a new construction house and the lot was mainly dirt This project was a challenging one because of the uneven space and I wanted to extend it by removing part of the hill side of the back yard
 After spoking with an office personal from SOD builders for the initial meeting that I had with them I met with Oren Oren was able to provide me with 2 designs including an estimate for each one of them in order to help me get few ideas of what I can do and mainly the cost of the extended lot 
My main goal was to had an outdoor kitchen that will include
BBQ area with nice seating table and chairs
Rounded fire pit that will be surrounded by a stone bench with pillows
Grass area
Outdoor patio that will be insideoutside seating This was my main goal in this remodeling and the most important task
My main concern was that during the past I did some remodeling work and my experience with them was not good at all In one of the cases the contractor just left the site in the middle and never came back to finish the work Luckily enough this was not the case with SOD builders Oren was particularly educated about this type of projects and he provided great recommendations Sure enough there were some problems and issues but Oren solved them when they arrived and without involving us too much with the solutions This could only happened when you have all this extensive experience with what you do and love to do I was mainly fascinated with the hard working and ethic of the actual workers I can state that they always came to work at the house on time they were polite and made sure not to leave a mess after each working day SOD builders did such an excellent job and each time I hear a good word from someone that visit my house I feel much happier about SOD builders and MAINLY Oren"
5,We used SOD builders Inc for our kitchen remodeling project This remodeling included all the new and custom upper and lower cabinets with an island in the center of the kitchen that added so much beauty and functionality to the super strange kitchen layout The quality of the wood cabinets is really great and high Great thick wood antislam doors changeable shelves modified doors and even custom handles Oren from SOD builders Inc installed all the counter tops that matched perfectly with the wood The island that we did was furnished with the under sink and wine cooler The efficient recessed lights and the low voltage lights in the upper cabinets added so much functionality features to the kitchen which was excellent The engineered wood flooring was installed by Orens workers in the kitchen after Oren helped me personally to get a great discount on from his vendor And Last thing was the backsplash who also was installed beautifully Oren is a remarkable contractor in the Los Angeles area He provide outstanding customer service and deliver a great construction He also have a very professional and great staff  When I contacted Oren for the first time I felt I was in good hands He had an incredible attitude and he arrived ready to the appointment The remodeling project was managed in a fast pace and everything was remodeled with real knowledgeable specialists Looking how the working crew was working on the kitchen was pretty substantial They were very accurate detailed and cared about quality I was surprised to see the crew cleaning the site after finishing their daily work At the end we had a very good experience with Oren from SOD builders Inc and we are very pleased with the great work and final price I highly recommend SOD builders Inc construction
5,Oren and his team from SOD builders were fantastic people to work and deal with for the remodeling project that they did at my house They remodeled my kitchen 2 bathrooms and the 2 bedrooms In the kitchen we remodeled the whole kitchen by replacing the cabinets counter top back splash lightings sinks appliances and all the hardware Oren and the designer were able to design the kitchen completely on a set of 3D designs and they were able to do it as close as possible to the real thing This design was a great feature that allow us to see how it will look in reality The bathrooms were also designed and planned by Oren and his office The bathrooms were demolished completely and Oren redesigned it completely by replacing the shower in one of them and the bath tub and shower in the other one On top of that He installed all the vanities faucets lights outlets and floor The bedrooms were the easy ones because all we did was the new paint crown molding closet and carpet Oren made sure that the rooms will be ready first so we can live in the house while the other spaces are being remodeled We noticed that Oren has a great attention for aesthetics functionality and beauty He always keeps the resale value of the house in mind just and he kept mentioning that to us in case we will thing to sell the house in the future His communications skills added a great amount of trust and happiness and even the suggestions that he gave us in regards to the whole remodeling were a good plus They were very patient with us during the selection process of all the materials and even coming back multiple times when our little ones prevented us from being as efficient as we hoped Weve heard so many bad stories of contractors that either left in the middle or did a bad job that caused to redo all the work again This was certainly not the case with SOD builders and the people there they were efficient and even surprises happened they did the work without any additional fees The only increase that we had was when we decided to increase the work around the fireplace in the living room We will recommend SOD builders to our friends and family and we will show their work s referrals We usually dont give reviews but they were worthy
5,I recently had the powder room at my house completed remodeled by Oren and his workers from SOD builders The old powder room had so many issues and it was not functional enough to our needs It was originally done by the original builder so Oren and his team had a few challenges on their hands due to the bad existing layout Oren was able to address all the issues with the powder room by maximize the space and installing as many cabinets as he could and I am extremely pleased with the end results His team of workers installed new drywall fully sanded and painted the walls and ceiling with color combination that was recommended to me by Oren at one of our meetings before I hired them they also fixed the plumbing and replaced some of the pipes did a complete electrical work by adding several outlets and switches and installed the vanity toilet and tile flooring Oren made sure to provide me each daily with any update on the project and he made sure I was happy with every detail and stage of the powder room He was extremely patient and understood exactly what I wanted  I am very particular about my home and I stressed to Oren how important it was for me to have every perfect Oren understood and reassured me that he would make sure I was happy with the results Oren and his team exceeded my expectations which is pretty hard to do I recommend SOD builders for anyone looking for a quality contractor to remodel their home  I will definitely be using SOD builders for future projects in my home
5,"Hiring SOD builders and working with Oren was a great and smart decision to do 
We recently did our huge kitchen transformation The job included the removal of few walls ceilings popcorn being removed new plumbing new lighting and outlets with some smart home features etcThe interview process was very intense and massive We feel we interviewed a fairly amount of contractors 7 We talked and met a variety of peoplecompanies from small to large We called to each one and spoke to them over the phone and did a research about them making sure that they have valid license insurance and bond We talked to few secretaries that couldnt say our names correctly even and made mistakes with the appointment schedules  When we called Oren from SOD builders he the owner answeredhuge and big advantage on the rest Some of the contractors that visited our house for an estimate would either agree to all of our requests by saying absolutely or of course yes we can knock down this wall and not worry about support  And some of them kept telling me how they wanted to model our kitchen not listening to our requests or ideas Oren was a very straight to the point kind of guy and without any selling stories  He told us we could knock down walls but be sure about any support beams that would have to stay or replaced  The first day we talked through the design and all the financing options  Since it was our first big project we honestly didnt have any idea about how much it could cost The demolition was quick and clean It took them only 2 days to complete this task The working team were very nice to us and we got to know a lot about them They made sure to use plastic covers every day and sweep up at the end of every day and made sure our house was livable We ran into some of the beam support issues we mentioned above  Oren came up with a great solution that caused us to redesign the kitchen look Oren came up with a suitable layout that worked for us  This actually changed the focal point of the kitchen and we loved the new look with this change The project took a bit longer than we thought it would but was within the time frame that Oren promised us  We couldve had it done in less time but we wanted to take our time and to make sure that we are comfortable  The final kitchen is really stunning We can see that there was a lot love care special touch and craftsmanship into the smallest finishing details Oren was on site almost every day  If it wasnt him then his foreman was  He was equally as professional and committed as Oren was  Oren saw every step all the way through and ensured no detail was over looked  There was even a few details we asked for at the beginning of the project that we failed to remind him of that made its way into the final product  We were really happy to see this There were several of small problems and things that needed to be addressed after the project ended but Oren was there  He popped in to make sure all was still good  He does this because the house needs a chance to settle in a bit  He addressed them no problem OVERALL EXCEPTIONAL JOB by Oren and his team at SOD builders  We will definitely be working with him again"
5,"We recently hired SOD builders for a few projects at the house The remodeling project was including 
Adding a balcony Door and window from the bedroom to the patiobackyard 
Full complete bathroom remodeling 
New fireplace and mantel installation 
Retiling the entryway and the kitchen with dining area  
 Oren and the workers definitely won our business after meeting us at the house and worked around our budget and they delivered exactly the results that we were hoping to get from them Oren was very professional and knowledgably throughout the whole time of the remodeling and any issue that we had with anything Oren was able correct it He was also extremely helpful by explaining us how things would look after we had trouble visualizing few things like the pattern of the tile What really put them over the top in our book was that 3 weeks after the remodeling was done Oren called up to follow up after the work was completed and ask if everything was still to our satisfaction I have noticed a few small gaps in the grout on the flashing around the shower but it never really bothered me too much  But since he called I mentioned this to him and he sent one of his guys over to take care of it Orens worker also installed a new water regulator in the shower after the water pressure was too high after using it for a month We are pleased with everything and would recommend to friends and would use them on future projects

I have attached before and after photos of the fireplace and bathroom jobs the work speaks for itself"
5,We found SOD builders after being frustrated in the past from other contractors From the initial meeting that we had with Oren we were impressed Their values of customer satisfaction and their deliver everything they said Oren was the manager of the work and he was on time for all the meetings that we had with him He was very straight kindly and motivated to be invited into our house He came back and took all the measurements that he needed for the kitchen asked us many questions about what we would like to include in the new kitchen and 3 days after he brought us a 3D design for us to look at and see how it will most likely look like It was exciting to see how fast they could generate a nice design Oren knew what hes doing and we were sure he has done this type of jobs many times before Their prices are reasonable We wanted our kitchen finished as soon as possible so we agreed with Oren to start the following week That gave us little time to buy all the appliances hardware countertops tiles Etc Oren personally went with us to 2 showrooms where we picked out our tiles and countertops He also helped us to search and buy all the options for the sink faucet hardware and more To be honest I was probably a nightmare type of work We moved out of our place during the month of the remodeling and we were a little worried that something would go wrong and we would end up on a terrifying remodeling show Now after this remodeling is over we can say clearly that is nothing to worry about when SOD builders are working at your house Their workers was clean friendly willing to answer questions I discovered that Oren visits the job site every few days but he too sincerely cares about your home He always called regarding the schedule timeline or if there was a problem that need to be solved We asked for changes to the electric wiring after the tiles have been installed Would I recommend them to others Absolutely yes We will refer this company to all our friends
5,"We would like to express our excellent experience with the remodeling of our house that was done by SOD builders and managed by Oren Our recently completed full home remodeling that included
Master bedroom
Master bathroom
Hallway 
Guest room remodeling
Laundry room
The remodeling came out great and we are honestly enjoying each part of it due to the success of it When we initially met with Oren in the beginning of this year we discussed the first project which was to remodel the kitchen laundry room and entry of the house Prior to meeting with Oren we met with several other contractors Some were big companies that sent to us a salesman that tried to keep adding things and things that we didnt need in order to make the estimate much bigger and with tons of promises that most likely cant be fulfilled What we knew from the past was that in order to have the closest estimate as possible we will need to have our own architect that will provide us with a fully detailed design of the work that we want to do and by that we will know exactly what we need Oren with his own expertise was able to see it and understand the design very easily and this was a real bonus and we could tell from our first meeting that he definitely brought much more to the table than the other contractors What we didnt know before Oren completed the remodeling was how great his work will be and how efficient as well We feel pretty much fortunate as most of the time you hear horrible stories from people about construction Oren and his team always kept us up to date and there was hardly a day when someone wasnt at the house working The team was trustworthy and competent and we could always reach Oren and his staff at the office when we needed For these reasons we were very comfortable putting our second project in his hands We would not hesitate to recommend Oren for any remodel or construction project We thank him for making our home beautiful"
5,From the first day I called SOD builders and met with Oren I was impressed with their customer service very much and how they know to follow up everything After talking to Oren over the phone and explaining to him my goals and what I would like to do I knew instantly that this would be the company that I will hire to remodel my kitchen Oren and Jacob the owners are extremely knowledgeable And he know how to manage and handle every aspect of the remodeling visit the house on a daily basis and perform regular checks about the progress of the remodeling and clearly not only takes pride in each and every work but is knowledgeable and definitely involved in each step of the process He and his office manager Yael and his interior designer Rachael guided me in all my decisions and made sure I stayed on budget and still get the most out of the needs in this remodeling without compromising any of the design elements I wanted and needed The crew that were working under the supervision of Oren were hard workers and knew exactly what they need to do and they did it on the best side making sure that everything is in perfect finish They were professionals and very polite I have never dealt with workers like this before and I was extremely suppressed with them In the bottom line the new kitchen is beyond my expectations We finished the remodeling of the new kitchen ahead of schedule and a little bit above budget for some additions that we wanted to have and were not included in the initial estimate
5,At first we wanted to remodel the kitchen at our house by our self but we figured out that it will be so hard and complicated for us to even manage this type of a project so the best option was to hire a contractor instead and let him do it This idea a great idea but the only challenge we had was that we wanted the kitchen to be done as soon as possible We did our research through several online sites in order to find the right contractor We were honestly impressed by the all the photos that we saw about SOD builders past projects and we decided to give them a call and to meet with them in order to determine if they are the right for us In total we interviewed 6 contractors so frustrating and time consuming and we looked over all the estimates that we got in order to compare them apple to apple and to scope the project SOD builders estimate stood out because they were the one that reached out to us when we had all the hard and easy questions about the estimate The kitchen space was the biggest issue because it supposed to be the main focal point in the house and the main space in our requirement in the remodeling Oren had so many great ideas He suggested us to tear down the wall that separating the living room from the kitchen We loved this idea because it will give our home a big open space feeling AND connecting all rooms At the end of the work we were blown away by the new transformation Oren listened to our ideas and he was able to incorporate all of them into the new design of the kitchen All the work was done and completed on the time that we agreed before we signed the agreement with Oren We couldnt be happier with the way everything turned out There is more work to be done in our home but we are holding off until things get more settled SOD builders construction will be the first place we contact once we decide to move forward
5,"I hired SOD builders for a 650 sqft of living room addition Before we hired them we already had all the necessary plans on hand including all the secured building permits with the city When it comes to workmanship and speed I must admit that landmark construction was very fast while investing extra attention to perfection All the teams of workers worked fast even when it came to fixes and adjustments They replaced the wood floor with new engineered wood flooring repainted the entire ceiling and one living room wall and blended new stucco on the exterior wall The new addition required new foundation framing and window installation We are thoroughly content with all the work that was completed by SOD builders 
1they made sure to cover everything all around the working area in order to prevent damages and extra work due to paint spots and dust from all the sanding 
2They came to work on a daily basis and few times they skipped work BUT they made sure to confirm that 2 days ahead This was very responsible from them to do
3Oren the Project Manager was available and reached all the time When he couldnt talk or answered he called within the hour
In regards to pricing the price that we got from SOD builders was in the middle range Oren came over to the house several times to discuss about the details and the process of the project and after that he start working on the estimate"
5,I found this fantastic construction company almost by an accident literary driving close by and never regretted it Few months ago I needed to renovate my kitchen and to make a very quick decisions on whom to hire to help with the design and with the actual construction The personal at the company were very friendly and I was very lucky to find that my advisor Oren was available to take my kitchen remodeling project right away We met a few times at my house Oren explained me all details of all variations of the cabinets the company is working with and I made my choice very quickly The counter top was installed by another company that specialized in counter tops and Oren arranged a few meetings with the company without any delays and to my full satisfaction The design part took very swift period and after few changes was approved and sent to production The cabinets came directly from the factory on time and in good order and condition Oren worked with workers explaining them the details of the design and how it will need to look We have chosen a contemporary cabinets for the new kitchen with several twists and new materials By the end of the remodeling the installation was very easy and painless and I am very happy with the result  I love the new kitchen and I would highly recommend Oren and SOD builders to anyone who needs high quality kitchen
5,I contacted SOD builders and spoke to Oren about what I would like to do at my house and what is my style and goals Oren came over to my house on the day and time that we scheduled over the phone and he inspect the 2 bathrooms and kitchen For a while we had major mold problems in the bathrooms and we start to have our concerns about it which caused us to do this remodeling ASAP For this remodeling project we spoke to few other contactors and we received few bids as well but we still decided to go with SOD builders even though there was not big of a difference in the price I was impressed with the way SOD builders and mainly with Oren What caused that was the great communication that we had with him and his way of thinking and ideas A week after the meeting and after we saw in details the design and estimate that Oren did for us we signed the initial contract and we gave our approval to complete remodel the bathrooms and kitchen with Oren and his team and we set a date to start the work The problem with mold that we had in the bathrooms Oren brought his people to do the demolishing first and after that they moved forward and start the construction We were more than happy with the final results of the remodeling and we would recommend SOD builders to anybody we know For us the total cost was the main issue that we have and after that was the communication SOD builders was the only company that was able to work with us about the price and during the work He made sure to stay in touch each few days with us throughout the remodel Once again Oren Leslie and the actual people that did the remodeling were all outstanding Everybody that worked on our home was friendly very knowledgeable and took great care in the work they did
5,"I was referred to SOD builders by a neighbor who had a driveway installed I had an old concrete backyard and old bricks on the front of my house I met with Oren after I spoke and got the basic information from the office staff about how they work 
Oren was able to present me so many available options for my backyard front walkway drains and chimney His estimate included various options I could choose from and he was very fair Oren was able to meet with me at one of his suppliers in Ventura and he helped me to select the pavers for the house He was able to share his experience with the different types of products 
Oren made sure to keep in touch by either calling or texting every day during the project and introduced me to Jacob who was the foreman Both of them were extremely valuable as anytime there was a decision in cutting a paver or locating a drain they provided their experience to make the best decision for my specific job The crew worked hard all day and cleaned up the debris on a regular basis 
I am very happy with the job they did at the back of my house and in the front The new look of the house is completely different now I am considering another project on the side of my house and there is no hesitation at all about who will I hire for that job I will definitely hire SOD builders I highly recommend them"
5,We recently hired SOD builders and their crew of workers to design and remodel my new master bedroom that included the master bathroom as well for our house Prior to the remodeling I researched and met with three other contractors and designers and asked them for an estimate and referrals for that job and after meeting with all of them I knew that Oren from SOD builders was the right contractor for me Oren was extremely creative honest and open minded person that cares a lot about the project from the begging of the work till the end Before the work started and during the process of finding the right one I was concerning is I do the right decision and what will happened if to start this work but after the work started and Oren start to appear at my house and supervised the actual work all my fears and concerns vanish and it was a really smooth process Oren and his team communicated with me before during and after each stage of the work to make sure everything went smoothly and without any mistakes and more than that he went above and beyond a lot of things that werent included to make sure that I get exactly what I wanted Oren even went with me to select buy and pick up all of the items that I needed for the project including the floors paint crown moldings fixtures stones for the vanities doors etc  He even helped me to make the final look as I always wanted Things happened when he said they would happen and there werent any big surprises or hiccups along the way They completed the project on time AND MAINLY on the budget which was the biggest factor and fear in this whole work
5,I am so happy I choose SOD builders for my bathroom remodeling project at my house During the years I heard so many peoples nightmare with contractors that caused me to do a triple search for a good company that can come and do the work without any hidden charges and mainly to be able to complete the work I was pretty nervous about the remodeling After 5 estimates and meetings with contractors I decided to go with SOD builders after my research about them showed me that they are a good company and that they are in business for a long time already Oren was the project manager He was very helpful super nice and professional I am kind of a picky person and he was very patient with me He came to my house or call me every day and check to make sure I am happy with every step on the way Oren and his team worked six days a week came on time clean up every day When they left they made sure to keep the rest of the house as clean as possible Now after my bathroom remodeling is completed I have a beautiful new bathroom to enjoy I am very happy with it I absolutely recommend SOD builders Remember to ask for Oren you will not be disappointed
5,"I just completed my full home remodeling that included the kitchen 3 bathrooms Dining room and 2 bedrooms SOD builders was the best construction company that Ive worked with Oren and his team of professionals were good with communication they returned all my phone calls and emails within the same day of the following day and were responsive to all our request questions ideas thoughts and changes mainly when they start to open walls They are fully licensed bonded and insured contractors and came up with the proper paperwork to prove it The initial pricing was competitive and logic while the addons we had during the work were very well priced The kitchen remodeling included basically everything from new floor and new cabinets to new paint and island in the middle The bathrooms were also remodeled and they needed to have new shower vanities plumbing and paint as well and the bedrooms needed new paint and carpet with cabinets for the closets 
The working crew and some in home vendors were ontime and at full size throughout the remodel Jacob the foreman was great person to work and deal with He came up with some great suggestions and ideas for changes that really improved the final work and few of them even made the work a bit cheaper and saved us money The quality of the whole remodeling was more than excellent It was completed ontime 2 months from start to finish and onbudget  which was the main important thing in this whole work The final items were addressed in a timely manner to our complete satisfaction Weve already recommended him to a friend and would highly recommend this company to anyone doing home remodeling It was a pleasure working with them and when we finally decide how we want the living room lighting Ill have them back to do the work"

5,"When I and my partner moved into the same house we instantly realized that we will have to make several improvements in order to fit the house for both of us The first thing that we had was the tiny sink in the master bathroom and the shower This master bathroom was the first thing that we needed to do  In addition to that there was not enough space for the both of us We also had some plans in mind for this bathroom bedroom closet in order to make it as a walkin closets Once we agreed to a master bathroom and closet remodeling we met with Oren from SOD builders and when he came over he looked and took it from there As part of our meeting with Oren We brought up the idea about remodeling the kitchen bedroom and to do the hardscape in the back and front of the house By adding all of this as a one big deal Oren and his workers were able to do much better work than what we thought to get The bedroom is the master bedroom at the house and Oren redesigned it and gave it a completely new look and feel  In the hardscape part of the house Michelle the designer of the company came up with a brilliant concept of how it can be and the sketch of her design caught our attention immediately Her design included all the new plants trees Stamp concrete and outdoor small kitchen with BBQ that included a bar seating area and a fire pit 
In the front of the house she was able to design new entry to the house and several steps with nice rocks and tropical trees The deal that we got from Oren was very good and we took it We were able to live at the house while they worked there and it was not as bad as we thought it will be Oren made sure to concentrate at the house first and to do all the dirty work in all the spaces and then to do all the outdoor items The work was completed after 3 months of work and without any major problem The office communicated with us during the whole project and it made it easy and comfortable If youre nervous about hiring a contractor dont be You just need to follow our advice and feel free to contact SOD builders"
5,The work that we needed to do was kind of big We had to interview several companies prior to execute the work When we met Avi from SOD builders we were kind of worried about what will he say or recommend us to do Our thoughts were not good Avi was pretty experienced with this type of projects He was able to show us several projects that he did in the past and we were able to confirm them The work that took more than 3 months was pretty intense  There were people each day working on the house The roof people the kitchen workers and the windows During all the time of the work we met with Avi several times when we had to see and check all the plans prior to have them done Avi was able to explain to us everything about the work There was not a day that the workers missed to come over The whole project went without any problem All permits were taken care of by Avi and all we took care of were the payments The price that we got from them was a little bit less than all the other estimates that we got
5,We remodeled our medium size kitchen approximately 15 ft by 20 ft that included new paint new floor lighting fixtures Counter top and sink The work was performed by Avi and his 4 workers Avi worked hand by hand with them and made sure that our kitchen will be completed as we wanted The work was divided by several sections The first section was the demolition in which the workers removed the old kitchen including the drywalls and after that was the installation of all the new lightings and cabinets We were happy with the fact that Avi ordered all the materials for the kitchen and we only had to select the colors and types from the big selection of samples that Avi present us The new kitchen was completed after 4 weeks when originally Avi promised us that it will be longer than that His workers came to work each day and worked till late hours We will recommend Avi to our friends and we are very happy with the new kitchen that he built for us
5,Avi from SOD builders was fantastic from start to finish of my remodeling project He met me at the property several times to get a more detailed proposal together He was informative good communicator and honest You know those types of contractors that just end up doing the bare minimum and still end up taking twice the amount of time they estimated Avi doesnt that way I unfortunately didnt choose him for our investment property but wish I had The contractor I ended up choosing came from a personal reference and we had a good rapport but ended up doing exactly what I said above Taking twice as long a little bit of extra unexpected work and bad time management and perhaps scattered with a little lazy and going over budget Avi on the other hand I believe from his detailed analysis of every little thing gave me the confidence that he wouldve finished near to the estimated completion time and would have done so responsibly and with enough detail that I wouldnt feel compelled to go back and go through every little thing to ensure I got my moneys worth During the whole remodeling at the house that included new floor paint lighting fixtures closets and carpet Avi was there to make sure that everything is good and going according to the plan Avi made sure also that the workers will cover all the things that they wont replace so they will be protected while they were working
5,This is the second time that we use this company for a project at our house A while back we used them in our previous house and we liked the way they worked their price and the end results of the work that they did This time was not difference Out initial meeting was with Oren He came to our house on the day and time that we scheduled ahead of time When he came over he looked at the bathroom and came up with some nice recommendations and ideas that can still fit in our budget and be nice The bathroom includes paint vanity Floor and shower The massive work took over 2 weeks Each day Oren made sure to come over with his team of workers 34 each day and to guide them on how things need to be done and what has been done since the last time he visited our house The total amount was very fair and we didnt have any changes or hidden charges at all
5,SOD builders did a room addition to our house it was clear that additions are their specialty This is our first time remodeling so we were new to the process Daniel our project manager took a special care of everything that was involved in this addition from revising the plans helping in choosing the final materials purchasing them and making sure that they will arrive to the house on time so all the workers will keep working without stopping due to missing materials The whole work went smoothly and without any problem We are honestly and fully satisfied with the end results and we are so happy that we hired them The workers arrived to the house always on time and didnt miss any day during the work they were honest and open to any idea that we had and answered to all of our questions when we had them We knew we wanted to add another bedroom to our house but were not really sure about the specifics Daniel shared his ideas while working with ours Daniel and the workers truly know how to work with their customers which made this whole experience so much easier In the past we heard horrible stories in the past about companies surprising customers with hidden fees which results in paying more for the project than originally planned The price we agreed on was the same from beginning to end If you are looking for a trustworthy and dedicated company then we recommend SOD builders 100
5,"We highly recommend SOD Builders  Extremely professional competent and hard working  Oren was extremely patient with us as we tried to work out how to get the kitchen of our dreams within our budget  He genuinely wanted us to be 100 happy with the design before we committed  The price Oren gave us was very competitive and included an interior designer Carmit Oron who pulled a beautiful functional design together that is perfect for our busy family  Oren made everything so stress free for us he took care of all the details of the building permit and project management
The workers turned up at our house on the set date and from then on we had workers in the house most days  If they couldnt make a day in the week they asked if it would be okay to come at the weekend  They were reliable polite friendly and very tidy putting up plastic screens to protect the house from dust and sweeping at the end of the day We were connected to the whole team with the BuilderTrend App this was invaluable as my husband and I both work and it allowed them to communicate with us and send photos of the progress  Oren checked in with us regularly and and answered emails 247 always with his goal of us being happy nothing was ever too big a problem
We are so happy with our kitchen and I will be calling SOD to do our next projects  Truly a first class construction company with exceptional customer service  Calling SOD was the best decision I made  I love my kitchen"
5,I contacted SOD builders to see what it will require to remodel my kitchen At first I spoke to Michelle who was very nice and polite to me over the phone and she asked me some basic question in order to understand what my goals are After that phone conversation she asked me if I would like to schedule a meeting with Oren The meeting was scheduled for the following week and Oren arrived to my house on the time frame that Michelle gave me she was kind enough to even call me an hour before to make sure that Im home and to inform me that Oren was on the way The meeting with Oren was very good Oren was able to provide me with good samples of cabinets Floor and paint colors combinations His main goal on that meeting was to see the existing kitchen and to get some measurements of the space in order to maximize the space At the end of the meeting Oren and I scheduled another meeting in order to present to me a 3D design of how the new kitchen will look like and how much will it cost me even though I mentioned my max budget at the first meeting The second meeting was very good as well Oren presented to me the kitchen design that showed me how the new kitchen will look like and I was very impressed After finalizing all the estimate materials colors and the price Oren went back to his office in order to generate a schedule work plan so I will know what and when my new kitchen will be ready The work went pretty smooth and it went according to the schedule plan that Oren did The workers were nice and polite as well and Oren visited the house almost every day to make sure that the work is going according to plan A month and a half after my kitchen was completed and it came out even better than the one that I saw in the design
5,Very good company and people to work with Originally we were interesting in removing a wall in the dining room area that will show a bigger open space We spoke to several companies and we came across SOD builders We loved the fact that they are having multiple offices with lots of years of experience and that in our initial meeting we were able to get all the answers for our questions and the ideas that could improve our house Oren is a great communicator person and he has a good amount of knowledge when it comes to remodeling and design He met with us several times and he also was able to give us a price that was very comparable to the other ones we got The work started with the removal of the wall and it continued from there to the kitchen and bathrooms We rebuild the space for the bath tub prior to the new installation of it and floor We couldnt have been more pleased Oren did expert work very cleaned and detailed They worked up daily and they were so nice and pleasant people  We are so thrilled with this bathroom  We had no idea it would look so nice I cant recommend this company enough SOD builders is the one stop shop place they provide everything that you will need for the job  If you are looking to upgrade or remodel your bath or kitchen go with them
5,We hired SOD BUILDERS as the first project we decided to NOT complete ourselves due to some difficulties that came up and it was too much for us Were typically DIYers and we are pretty good at it if we do say so Our kitchen project was much larger in scope than we could tackle and a friend recently had SOD BUILDERS complete their kitchen We didnt shop around and we trusted on our friend recommendation and we also saw the finished kitchen that they did Our initial meeting with Oren just gave us all the information we needed in order to give the approval for this project We were paired up with Oren who visited our home listened to our ideas and took them to the next level His details and space planning expertise was good  complemented by Juan to help select finishes This was also the first time I put my trust in others to select or at least to help us with finding finishes and materials Their pricing for this project was reasonable and worthy the project management and coordination was painless and the overall results are stunning
5,"My husband and I purchased our home in last year that needed of lot of remodeling  The house was in a very bad condition and it needed to be fully renovated From our past experience we knew how the process was going but we were fully committed to finding the right contractor for this and to get this renovation project going and complete It pretty sad to see that no one in my family friends or neighbors were able to refer someone they had used in the past because they had such a bad experience during or after the remodeling We interviewed pretty much a lot of contractors but we must say that Eran from SOD builders was the most honest and pleasant contractor weve met from all the other ones From the very beginning he told us what to expect and what we need to do before hiring A contractor He initially told us we need an architect to change the structure and layout of the house We tried to differ from his advice but we realized he was right about hiring the architect We needed an architect to legally change the structure and layout of our house Eran invested time to gain our trust by presenting to us some of his previous jobs for reference His estimate SOD builders was not extremely low which means his work was not low quality but it was not extremely high either it was in the middle  We believe his price was very fair and reasonable for all the amount of work we required Now after the work is completes I can write that I am very happy we decided to hire him for this project 
From the moment Eran took over this project his team has made this process a lot easier for us they completed the demolition of our home in 4 days which was impressive They began by leveling out the floors and created the new layout of our home right after They were knowledgeable well experienced and they followed all the steps and stages in the plans Everything that was on paper was coming to life right before our eyes and it was an unforgettable experience The footing  foundation are very solid the framing exterior finishing and the interior finishing were remarkable and used great materials Overall his team are highly skilled contractors and I will forever be grateful for their talent and exceptional customer service His team was extremely professional respectful hardworking and reliable individuals They were always united always on time and always available to answer our questions It was such a beautiful pleasant experience that I will always speak very highly of SOD builders and I will never trust anyone else other than this team to do work in my house or any other project I may face in the near future"
5,"We had a great experience with Oren from SOD builders Oren was able to do a good job at our house remodeling the master bathroom and bedroom of our kids with his bathroom too
The bathroom in our kids room is jack and Jill that has a showertub with large vanity The decision to work with Oren and his workers was taken after several meetings with him and his designer Michelle Michelle was very creative with her ideas about what to do and Oren explained to us each step and stage of the remodeling The materials were selected by Oren and he gave us several options after he learned what we would like to do and what type of styles we love The work in the bathroom included the removal all the old tiles bath tub and shower and install new ones with the design that we selected The work came out very good and it brought a new life to the bathroom including the new shower handles Paint vanity with sink and faucet
The master bedroom required more work due to the age of it We wanted to have marble floor and special tiles all over the walls paint and some extra storage cabinets that will allow us to have extra space Oren worked with his workers on this project on a daily basis and the remodeling came out very good Oren was able to assign 2 teams of workers to our house and to make sure that the work will end according to schedule"
5,Oren from SOD builders is great general contractor I have ever hired A close friend recommended him and I couldnt be happier Oren first did some smaller jobs like replacing all our toilets with watersaving models He also fixed a serious leakage problem that we didnt know about because it was caused by the flooring people not putting in the correct toilet seal The musty smell that we couldnt find is now gone He finished a bathroom remodel tearing out the vinyl showertub and replacing it with a Jacuzzi whirlpool tub The bathroom was quite large and now looks even larger not to mention beautiful He and his workers on the tub and tile installation that was complex and timeconsuming I was especially happy that he was able to adjust what I wanted to do to keep me within my budget by suggesting different tiling pattern choices We went with his suggestions and it is so much better than what we were going to do We would highly recommend Oren for repair work and remodels though we hope he doesnt get too busy We have started a new todo list for him
5,This company SOD Builders proved to me how great they are Its hard to remodel a house especially when you don t know where to start from or what to begin with I found SOD Builders on several places including a magazine and I called to their office and spoke to Sofia Sofia scheduled an appointment with Oren and she also called me an hour before to confirm the appointment Oren came over and after a 2 hours meeting he was able to give me an estimate for the kitchen He was so good of explaining the all the building and safety codes so I was pretty amazed with his knowledge He didnt push me to sign anything like other companies did and he wanted to have another meeting with me in order to show me a design of the new kitchen I liked that so after the second appointment and looking at his new design of the kitchen I decided to hire him His team of demolition people carpenters framers etc Was so knowledgeable and clean This guys do know how to take care of customers and how to work clean and good Oren was coming almost every day to check the work and go over the details with me again in order to make sure we dont miss anything and that Im happy with the current progress The job turn out great Oren made sure that I will not have to pay any other fee more over the contract I would recommend him to all my friend I am very HAPPY
5,Oren with SOD builders was the Manager that managed our remodeling project and his end results work and schedule was just perfect  I know when usually you start a remodeling project of any kind you figure the schedule to be very flexible and the remodeling project to always take weeks or months to finish beyond what the contractor says but in my review here I would like to tell you that Oren and his crew of people finished on time  All the workers worked every day and did not miss one day or late and the work was without any doubt top notch  I had really nothing to complain about  Therefore Oren and SOD builders deserve this positive  What I liked most in this remodeling was that Oren made sure that the workers will know exactly what do each day and that all the materials will be at the house waiting for them and not the other way around
5,I had two bathrooms completely remodeled with SOD builders Oren Oren did a great  quality work and delivered 100 on budget I was concerned about any hidden problems or charges at first since I had some concern there were few leaking pipes behind the wall that might have caused an issue Oren and his guys did a thorough probe testing before starting and making their estimates Everything ended up very well and I got two beautiful new bathrooms even though it was one week behind schedule but completely on budget which was great thing after all Our experiences with Oren The supervisor and the Designer on top of the tradesmen were 100 positive They took our need to leave in the house a fully functioning bathroom at all time and made it happen I must mentioned that several other companies told us clearly that it will be impossible to have it when I got an estimate from them  that was also more reasons to what SOD builders gave us and lived up to I am very pleased with our choice and the results
5,I have no complains about this company and the people that worked at my house At my house Oren sent 4 workers that came over and did all the paint work They covered everything and made sure to move all the bulky items so they wont get damaged After they finished the work they returned and arranged the items and then moved to the next area Oren assigned to my house his supervisor Charlie and he visited the house several times during the work time and made sure that we are happy and that there are no problems Most of the paint work was a sponge paint with 2 colors but the common areas were with a special paint which took longer to do Im very happy with this company and I highly recommend them for any paint work
5,"SOD builders just finished a full remodeling of our house It all started with our meeting with Oren and Michele by measuring and understanding what we want to do Michele came over several times and presented to us her designs and Oren was the person that tried each time to improve the space and to maximize the quality of the materials The remodeling started with the Kitchen and bathroom at the same stage of work while the work in the kitchen in process Oren and his workers started to work on the dining room  laundry room The plumbing and main rain replacement repairs work was done by several of his people and they did a great job in that part too The kitchen that we remodeled was with oak wood and included an island counter tops new outlets and appliances
The hallways contained several closets and storage spaces that were designed and installed by Oren and his people All exterior windows and texture coated the exterior of our house We had never before taken on anything like this and Oren walked us through every step of the way from permitting to code to design explaining what needed to be done in realistic steps The crew of workers showed up to the house on time every day and did a very professional job in all respects Any difficulties were taken care of immediately by either Oren or Avi Many great ideas came from these 2 and also from Michel The proof that SOD builders are great company is at the end results as now we have a beautiful home with all the modern touches and for much less than other bids that had much less work involved Everything that Oren said he would do he did I would recommend SOD builders for any size job you have in mind they stand by their word"
5,SOD builders provided us with an amazing customer service throughout the process of the remodeling from start to end Their prices were very competitive It doesnt get much better than this We were having foundation work done on my elderly mothers home in LA We arranged this remotely via a friend that recommended us to Avi and Oren Avi took time care and patience to make sure that the remodeling will be comfortable with the process and to answer each and every one of our questions This alone makes us recommend them as highly as possible Customer service of this level is very very rare today The work that they did was managed by Oren Oren brought his 3 men team and made sure they will do an amazing work and as fast as they could  I would use this company again without any hesitation Id give 6 stars if I could
5,"we LOVE LOVE LOVE SOD builders this is the THIRD time we are using them over the last ten years each for progressively bigger and bigger jobs they are so kind and on top of stuff and just get it done they have a manager assigned to the task so you have someone you can always call and they have someone for everything just whatever you need and they do it right 
whether it was little finishing touches or knowing just how to redo our old hardwood floors what sink to put in how to fix our cabinets fixing the deck outside making our outdoor area a beautiful patio space we now love making beautiful built ins for us interior and exterior painting fencing electrical refreshing our kitchen so that now it is just gorgeous all of it just done perfectly 
literally i cannot say enough good things i would never ever use another contractor working with SOD feel like you have an uncle in the business that you can just call when you need help and you know will be taken care of like family 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
5,Great company and people to deal and work with The main thing that I liked in this remodeling was the communication and the care that Oren showed me He gave me the feeling that his is remodeling his own bathroom and he cared for every detail in the remodeling The bathroom remodeling that I did started with the selection of all the materials color combinations and all the hardware that Oren will install in the bathroom Oren planned everything pretty good and he made sure not to have any extra materials so the total amount will remain the same At the end of the remodeling the total price was the same as the original estimate and this meant a lot to me because I heard so many stories where the final price become higher due to extra items that the contractor add during the remodeling
5,We had the need to enlarge the bathroom and to add a bath tub We spoke to several contractors and companies about this project and we met with few of them When we spoke to SOD builders The person that we spoke with was very nice and polite She scheduled a meeting with Adam Adam came over at the time frame that was scheduled ahead by the office and he was the person that was able to give us a good quote for that and we were able to speak to some of his past After we approved the quote and gave our OK to start Adam sent his workers to start work The work started with the demolition of the existing bathroom and adding the new frames Then all the plumbing and drainage was completed with the lighting When all of that was completed they did all the drywall and paint including all the electricity The floor was one of the last items that they did and it came out great I want to mention that we enjoyed working with Adam and his team of workers They are nice and professional people
5,"We recently had a master bath and a guest bath remodel with SOD BUILDERS
Their project manager Lance was very helpful in choosing the right materials and answered all our questions in every step
The team was very friendly respectful and cleaned every day the work was done
Although some issuesextra fixes came up they could finish project on time
Best customer service from the office too
Love our new baths"
5,This was my first remodel and it was a large project for a small space SOD was very professional from the beginning I never felt nickel and dimed which is typical for construction companies in this market The workers project managers and management were very responsive and focused on making sure I was happy with the work The quality of the remodel was excellent Ive gotten so many compliments from guests who have seen my gorgeous new bathrooms
5,"Look no further The construction team from SOD Builders saved my life after a stupid contractor disappeared leaving my house roof bathroom and kitchen unfinished he left trash all over and my roof was openuncovered and literally exposed to the rainwind and weather
I found SOD Builders on HOUZZ and made a decision to hire them after interviewing Oren and Michelle 
They were able to address the issues we had and found ways to help us to complete the work in minimum time and cost 
Me and my wife cant explain how we thank this company since they are our new angels
Thank you  thank you  Thank you
We are going to recommend SOD to anyone who need construction and home improvement work"
5,"Weve remodeled several homes and SOD Builders was by far the best experience weve ever had working with contractors 
We remodeled our entire home and added 800SF to the back of the house
The build pool house we cant wait to use it this coming summer Either Oren or Adam was on the Job Site almost every day the workman were courteous and cleaned up after themselves and the job was finished ahead of scheduled and turned out beautiful We could not give a higher recommendation Excellent company to work with"
2,"Ive been waiting for awhile to write this review I was genuinely hoping things would have worked out between us and SOD but that was not the case To be completely upfront we never got to the actual buildingconstruction part of our relationship with SOD We worked with them for over a year and ultimately left with a sour taste in our mouth over the whole experience Im giving two stars because even though we didnt end up working with them their designer Michele sp and some of their staff were great to work with 

We wanted to do the following to our home
Remodel master bathroom
Master bedroom  Install new flooring paint and sliding glass doorone window replaced They quoted 10000 for just this  FYI
Stairs  refinished
Living  build a custom bar resurface fireplace

We reached out to SOD through Houzz and they were prompt to reply They sent someone out to give us a quote Everything went fine and we called a few times after that but never received the quote After a few months we were slow to followup too they sent someone else out to give us another quote as it had been awhile since the first guy had come out to our house Thats when we started working with Michael and things went terribly from that point on I mean very very terribly 

Michael came out and did a walk through of the house with us He was having a hard time grasping what we wanted and wasnt understanding our vision On top of that we were having a hard time understanding him and what was included in their services At this point we were becoming frustrated but Michael assured us everything would be fine After a month we received the quote from him It was extremely poorly written and we couldnt tell what was included and what wasnt We had three separate phone calls with Michael and still couldnt tell what we were getting We said we wanted to think it over for a few weeks After a month we again contacted Michael and asked about the price difference between adding a bathtub to the master or not He then told us we would need to pay him 5000 for an architectural designer before he would do anymore with us This set off major red flags for us We were told before that design was included with SOD Michael then said he was going to be out of town but he wanted to send his colleague Ram to our home to see it and take some measurements that he missed We thought that was weird but agreed to call and setup a time with Ram After speaking with Ram it became VERY clear to Ram and to us that Michael hadnt work for SOD in over a month and Ram was very panicky because he thought Michael had told us when he clearly hadnt The most alarming part was NO ONE FROM SOD EVER CALLED US TO TELL US So we almost signed a contract with some other company and didnt even know it

At that point we called SOD and I feel like we were super reasonable since they never bothered to tell Michaels clients he had left the company We just asked to meet with someone else They sent their designer out to our home She was great and really restored our faith in SOD When the owner returned he came out and sent us a new quote We were discouraged to see the same quote style from Michael and ended up having to have ANOTHER call with the owner to figure out what was included and what wasnt We solved it by making a spreadsheet since about 10 items we asked for didnt show up in the quote AT ALL After that we took their final numbers and compared them to what Michael provided us in his first quote when he actually worked for SOD and they were much higher We approached the owned about the difference and he said  doesnt matter I wont go down to that price So he wouldnt honor a price his former employee made and we spoke to SOD again 

They never called us after that They never made any attempt to do right by us even though they basically set us up with someone who tried to defraud us I am honestly just 100 disappointed in the whole experience 

I think they do great remodelconstruction work if you can get past the poorly explained process bad company organization and lack of customer service We didnt and we lost a year of our lives to it I would not recommend SOD to anyone and I dont think they care about what they did to us or how our project was handled"
5,"I met with Eran from SOD last Spring and he had a lot of great ideas for my kitchen and bath remodel Their bid was very competitive and I selected SOD to do the project One of the key differentiation was that Eran did 3D renderings of the space and we went through several rounds before finalizing the scope of work This was a great way to finalize all of the details in a visual way which saved me on hiring a designer and undoubtedly saved a lot of rounds of changes once construction began Throughout the project everyone from SOD was incredibly responsive and Eran was my point of contact throughout the entire project Hes easy to work with highly serviceoriented and always available by phonetext or email

SOD has a large team with plumbers electricians and provides full services  from counters to flooring and shower doors The quality of the work was very high and they were also receptive to getting the smallest details just right I was most impressed after the job finished when Eran and team went above and beyond to make sure that every last detail was taken care of

SOD is an entrepreneurial modern construction company and I would use them again"
5,"I would definitely use SOD again for any future remodeling projects During the initial process of getting bids from various vendors they were not the cheapest or the most expensive but they had the best customer service and that is what won me over This being the first time Ive ever done a remodel I went over every detail of the bid and checked their referrals licenses insurance coverage etc Even before I committed Daniel was super great at responding and answering all of my questions and putting me at ease The process was painless and pressure free and I very much appreciate their approach

Daniel was an absolute pleasure to work with and his team did a wonderful job They were polite courteous considerate they made sure to cover areas that they would be walking through cleaned up the area daily etc and very accommodating during the entire process especially with changes along the way They remodeled both bathrooms at the same time from demolition to finish It was hard living with both bathrooms being done simultaneously and seeing as how these were my only bathrooms in my home my musthave was to have a working toilet during the remodel showering could be done elsewhere but a working toilet was deal breaker for me They not only finished ahead of schedule total time about 5 weeks but they also did a few extras for me ie installing a ceiling fan replacing hallway ceiling lights The results were remarkable and I couldnt be more pleased with the results Ive received many compliments on the work and have referred them to several friends and coworkers and will continue to do so

I would not hesitate to use them again When I remodel my kitchen I plan on using them again"
5,"I chose SOD for a complete kitchen remodel and plumbing upgrade Working with the designer Michelle was a pleasure  She had a clear sense of what we were looking for and knew just when to offer her opinion as we were sorting through the dizzying array of options  When the building actually began everyone at SOD was easy to contact the crew always professional  There were a few glitches but they were minor nothing out of the ordinary for such an extensive job 

Early in the process Oren the owner of the company told me that he would do whatever it took to make sure I was happy at the end of the joband he completely delivered  There was no request that wasnt honored no small issue that was ever contested They never made me feel picky even though there were times I felt that way  Oren called me a few months after the job was done to make sure I was happy  When I mentioned a few minor issues that had come up a cabinet door was sticking and the faucet had worked a little loose he had someone come out within a day to take care of them SOD didnt give me the cheapest bid they werent the most expensive either for the record but its worth a little extra money to find a builder that does beautiful work and is willing to work with you to make sure youre satisfied"
5,"Oren the general contractor gave us a bid that was reasonable and when he came to our house he brought his designer Michelle who showed us pictures and gave us ideas about what could be done to our house  Michelle was with us to help pick out tile granite slabs paint colors and cabinet styles  The job itself had one hicup but was remidied by Oren  The foremanwoman that was assigned to our job told us that if we had any questions we could call her day or night and she would be available  This turned out not to be the case and Oren eventually let her go and we were given a new foreman Robert who was available whenever we needed help
   Overall everything went well  Oren had workers at our house just about every day and the workers were very professional in doing their jobs  They even swept up at the end of the day so we wouldnt track dust into the rest of the house  Our remodel started on January 6th and was completely finished by March 14th  I have waited until now 6 months after completion to see if anything went wrong before giving my review and I can honestly say that everything has held up well  No cracks in the drywall and no leaks anywhere  Given all that was accomplished in just over 2 months I would say that Oren and his crew did a wonderful job"
5,"I am extremely pleased with the job that SOD Builders did for me a full kitchen remodel including a complete gut and redesign of the room   The quality of their work was topnotch the workers were always professional respectful and friendly   In particular SODs designer was very helpful in bringing my vision to life

No project of this magnitude is completely glitch free but SOD was very responsive to my every request  This is not a contractor you have to worry about deserting you midjob  

The answer to the ultimate question Would I hire them again for other work is Absolutely  Though it took a bit longer than I would have liked to complete the job in the end I couldnt be happier with the results  I will enjoy this space for decades to come"
5,We absolutely love Oren and SOD Builders Inc  After meeting with multiple contractors to remodel our entire home and we added 1500SF to it Oren was a breath of fresh air  He wasnt pushy like most other contractors  Instead he was polite knowledgeable trustworthy and professional  This project was our first remodel pretty massive for first remodel and we didnt know anything about the process  Oren guided us through everything from start to finish He listened carefully to what we wanted gave us suggestions and showed us lots of examples on his computer of other homes he had remodeled and build  Lance and Michelle went with us to stores to help us pick out everything in our homeappliances tile and counters They built us all custom cabinets  He was patient and supportive always offering his perspective and advice and helping us make color and style decisions  He Michelle our head designer and the rest of their team were all a pleasure to work with  They were hardworking polite knowledgeable paid attention to every detail and showed true pride in their work  Lesmi checked in with us every day either by phone call or by email  The crew cleaned up at the end of each day  The team was so efficient that despite us adding a few additional projects along the way they finished the project ahead of schedule  And we are extremely happy with our new home  It is more beautiful than we could have imagined and we are so thankful to Oren and his team  We have already recommended SOD Builders to family and friends and are looking forward to having him redo our rental home in the near future
5,"We called SOD to start a kitchen remodel  During the time they quoting us on the kitchen our hall bathrooms pipes exploded and we decided this project was more pressing  We were glad that we got to work with this company on a smaller project before tackling the huge project of our kitchen remodel  SOD did an awesome job with the bathroom  We are extremely happy with our new modern bathroom It is beautiful  We always felt comfortable with all the specialists that came to work on the house The work they did was top notch  Any questions or concerns we had during the project were addressed quickly  They also helped us to figure out design details and since this is not my forte we really appreciated the guidance  

We were so happy with the bathroom remodel that they are working on our kitchen now  It is coming together beautifully  I would absolutely recommend them for any project that you have"
5,"We love our kitchen and whats even more amazing we still love everyone at SOD  Through every step of the way we felt like Oren Michelle and team did everything in their power to give us exactly what we wanted or as was often the case something better than we could have imagined   We are a bit clueless on the design front  We knew we wanted a Dwell worthy high end kitchen that had warmth and natural stone elements while still being sleek and modern We had no idea how to do this  Michelle helped us design the kitchen change the layout reposition things and redesign the kitchen again  She helped us select materials match stain samples hardware everything And this call me anytime and I will pick up or call you immediately service is just part of the deal Its how SOD operates 

If there was ever anything that we were unhappy about it was addressed immediately I believe someone came out three times to make sure the wall of cabinetry fit into the soffit line perfectly We chose an incredibly difficult tile to install for our backsplash Each tile is individually cut and affixed to paper  The tiler pulled out individual tiles that we felt were too dark or light or misshapen dozens of them until it looked perfect They were very accommodating when working with the Miele specs for the custom panel refrigerator and even redid a panel when we saw a blemish The cabinetry makers SOD uses are craftsmen and you can tell when you look at the end result and feel the substantial drawers and cabinets in your hand The cabinetry and drawer hardware used is on par with what Poggenpohl and Boffi  After months and months of hard use I still get a little thrill every time the drawers soft close smoothly 

When we were conducting our search we were looking for quality excellent customer service and affordability SOD provides all of these NOT ONCE did we feel taken advantage of or overcharged in any way Our quote did not change  There werent any hidden costs or fees  In fact we found that we were so on budget that we were able to splurge on our cabinet hardware and backsplash

It has been nine months and we have not had a single issue with anything in our kitchen  It is still beautiful it still looks new and it is very very user friendly  This is a kitchen used and abused by children but appreciated by adults 

We couldnt be happier and will use SOD again in the near future"
5,"Professional clean knowledgable and punctual They finished building our new roof before a week was over and did not leave a mess 

Id definitely hire them again"
4,I sent an urgent request to SOD builder to get a bid for my bathrooms and garage remodeling project due to the water damage at home SOD customer service was really nice After I canceled my first appointment they were able to schedule a project manager to visit my place according to my time The project Manager was helpful and professional We got the estimates within 3 days
5,I had a guest bathroom remodel job and met with approximately four contractors SOD Builders came in with a cost that was within our budget We broke the job up into two stages the first was a demo of a 3x3 shower and build a walk in tile shower that can accommodate ageing parents with a grab bar shower bar soap shelf and seat New tile was laid and our new shower was a nice combo of large tile glass tile mosaic and stainless steel appointments and a seat Oren and his crew took about two weeks for the complete job which also included installing a shower light fan combo paint and trim The second portion of the rebuild was the installation of a new vanity and placing tile where the old vanity once stood This vanity was not made for a corner and SOD builders took the marble splash guard and matched it to another piece to create a corner vanity unit We are very pleased with the work performed and the crew that worked on this job We would highly recommend SOD builders for your construction  remodel jobs

Details
Oren and Michal his designer were fantastic to work with  Oren and Michal both met with us to walk through our home and understand the project we wanted to do  Orens bid was competitive but the biggest reason we decided to hire him is because we could see how passionate he is about his work and we felt that Michals vision was a perfect match for the look and feel we were going for

Michal was very helpful in the planning phase and helped design our kitchen layout and cabinets as well as our master bathroom  She was also extremely helpful when it came time to start picking finishes  She totally understood our style and helped us narrow down design options  In addition she was not afraid to let us know when she felt that we may be making choices that we could regret  We greatly valued her opinions and support

We had bought an older home that needed a lot of updating and improvement so the job was quite big  Luckily we were not living in the home during the remodel  However we stopped by to check the progress at least a couple of times per week and were always impressed that the workers cleaned up after themselves each day and stored their tools even though they knew we werent living there  Whenever we did see the workers they were always pleasant and courteous  

About midway through the project Orens foreman leading up our project left the company  This caused some delays but the new foreman Hector was even better than the first and did everything he could to help make up for lost time  We had told Oren from the beginning that he could take his time because we werent in any hurry to move in we were living at my fathers house so that I could take care of him until he passed away from cancer  The project was completed about 2 months behind schedule but we had added some work to the original scope and wanted Oren to take his time to make sure everything was done exactly how we wanted it  

We have now lived in our home for about 3 months  After we moved in we began to notice certain issues and defects and kept a running list of items to be fixed  Oren sent his crew back out about a month ago and fixed everything on our list with great attention to detail  We could not be any happier with our new old home

We have worked with other contractors on smaller projects at our previous homes before and they always quoted us much lower but the final bill was much higher and the quality of the work was lacking  We paid Oren exactly what he originally quoted us and are very happy with the results  We would highly recommend Oren for his professionalism attention to detail and passion for his work  He is an honest person and demands the same level of honesty and quality from his crew"
5,"I was impressed by SOD Builders commitment to satisfaction We had lots of small details that we wanted to do right and Oren was absolutely willing to get all the little things done properly and without a charge The most impressive thing was that we agreed on a price at the start and Oren stuck to it even when it would cost him extra money to get right

They did also a very good job of keeping my place clean keeping things running while doing construction and overall being very responsible and with a great regard to quality"
5,SOD Builders is a onestop shop to my dream house  With a complete team of project manager designer architect licensed plumberelectrician tilefloor specialists painters carpenters they can put together pretty much any requests that you may dream up for your projects  They did a gut renovation for me on an entire floor including demolishing and rebuilding a kitchen and 2 bathrooms removing popcorn ceiling and smoothing out textured walls updating all plumbing and electrical and putting in new hardwood floor  SOD Builders provided highquality work expert advice and topnotch customer services  The one thing the owner Oren said to me most often during the project was whatever makes you happy well do it and they do  They are very flexible to unexpected changes and always accommodating to the needs of the customers  I picked out all the floors and tiles I wanted and the project manager Adi helped me looked all over California to find the best prices for the materials  When a part of the fireplace didnt turn out looking like the design I had in mind they immediately sent a team to rebuild the area to change it to look exactly like what I wanted  For the bathrooms we decided to put up tiles on all walls we originally thought since all the walls were also newly built installing the cement boards under the tiles would be sufficient enough but Oren insisted on using the floating cement because he believes the method makes the bathrooms much more durable and provides better quality even though it was more costly to him and took longer to build  There were many examples like these throughout the project  I would highly recommend SOD Builders to anyone

Comments 
If you are looking for an honest contractor who can make your most ambitious dreams come true look no further than SOD Builders  I alrey had my own idea I even had my own drawings of how my new kitchen should look  I interviewed several highly rated contractors but I selected SOD for several reasons  I met with the Project Manager the Head Carpenter and Oren Dragan the owner all of whom seemed completely confident that they could meet my every expectation  SOD did not give me the lowest bid I received nor was it the highest but I was impressed by the fact that all of the major trades people were employed directly by Oren  That meant that they were hand selected by and responsible directly to him  It also meant that scheduling the various trades would be easier  It turned out that all of the tradesmen Carpenters Plumbers Electricians Cabinet Makers Tile Installers Painters etc were highly skilled professional and hard working individuals who worked together like a wellhoned team  While the basic plan was mine the end result was more than I could have imagined due to the experienced and creative input of Orens team  Joe the Head Carpenter came up with the idea of the tiered ceiling to beautifully unite the kitchen ceiling with the breakfast area ceiling which was vaulted  He even took the time to build a model of his idea out of a cardboard box to give us a visual of his concept  I could not ever improve on Golans the Cabinet Makers designs for the cabinets  Every drawer and cabinet were perfectly placed and completely functional All the drawer open to the full extent  All of the drawers and cabinet door have softclose hinges  The corner cabinet has a lazy susan  There are slideouts under the sinks and in the pantries  Best of all all of the pots and pans fit in drawers  The large flat screen TV in the kitchen looks like it is part of the cabinetry  The quality of the wood and the workmanship could not have been better  The same quality and devotion to perfection was true of carpenters plumbers electricians tile installers painters and countertop fabricators  All of the workers arrived on time every day worked hard all day long no goofing off and cleaned up the area every day before they left  This project passed all inspections with flying colors  Oren Dragan made sure that every detail was completed to perfection  I definitely would use SOD Builders again and I will highly recommend the Company to my friends and neighbors  It was a nohassle pleasure to work with Oren and his team"
5,"We first heard of SOD through another review company  They had the highest review rate and highest score  So we gave them a call  

My wife and I had a very good idea of what we wanted and how much we were willing to spend  I had originally built this bathroom and addition so I had a base knowledge in construction  When SOD arrived they were very professional and respectful and came with a slew of referrals  They listened to our ideas and then offered modifications to enhance our vision  We were very happy with all their changes to our initial design and even more delighted in that most of these opinions actually lowered our costs  Their offer was many thousands below the nearest competitor and their ideas were superior to any views we had previously heard  Their time frame was 3 weeks from start of demo to final inspection

It was several weeks before they began but once they started they moved quickly and efficiently  They took great care to cover and isolate the house from their work area  Demo occurred with the workers transiting the house in a plastic tunnel so as not to scatter dust and debris  All materials were quickly hauled off site  Each phase progressed similarly with the workers taking great care of the noninvolved portion of the house before they began work on the bathroom  I must give credit to Hector the foreman for providing a seamless transition from one phase to the next and being on site to take care of each question or request we had  He was very quick to rectify or resolve any problem we had  Another lido needs to go to SODs tile man  His work is superb  When my wife was unable to visualize the new ceramic floor he painstakingly arranged the floor in each of 3 patterns so she could choose which one best fit her initial vision  Once decided he applied the tiles floor shower walls and shower floors to perfection  The SOD plumber did a very good job of removing an existing water heater left in place during the demo and installing the new tankless one without leaving us hot waterless for more than an hour  A very good feat   SOD would have finished under 3 weeks but we opted to use a granite provider from whom we were able to procure a pice of fusion granite  That change forced SOD to hold off on 4 days of work but they neither complained or asked for a change order  

I am able to give SOD Builders the highest rating due to their work ethics abilities and final product  I have all ready referred them to 2 of my friends who are having work done to their homes  You wont go wrong using this company 

this review has also been posted on another referral site by me the homeowner

5,"It was a pleasure working with SOD Builders from start to finish Oren and Michelle came to our house and the end result is way beyond our expectations WE LOVE OUR NEW HOME
Oren  Michelle were the third estimate that we received they were not the lowest bid but they were very competitive they offered a new design and layout that no other company had thought of I guess thats a big difference when you have an in house designer and no it does not effect on pricing we had other companies that came and gave higher bid with no designer included The new layout is great they were able to open up the space in our living room to the kitchen my house looks like a picture in a fancy magazine and it is very efficient when it comes to the use of the space
The kitchen is just stunning and Im so happy I can show off when I have friends over When we bought the house the space was divided and it had a feeling of old and small and not so friendly
The working process was very easy I was always informed the crew was always friendly and professional When question and issues arise Oren and Michelle were available through there system very promptly and I always had the feeling that there will be no compromising on the quality of work nor my satisfaction
At the end we are very happy with SOD builders now Im trying to convince my husband on remodeling our master bathroom it has to match my new modern living space J will keep you posted
SOD Builders it was great thank you"
5,"I had a great experience with SOD Builders They ended up doing several projects for me remodeling my master bath and my kitchen as well as retiling my front entry way and adding lighting to my living room They seemed to work efficiently and completed the projects in a timely manner 
  I am quite happy with the quality of their work as well as they way they seem to stand by it Working with SOD was a really positive experience for me And even though my house is almost 40 years old Ive been told by more then one person the kitchen looks like a model home and the changes Ive made have let the house come alive again I would absolutely work with SOD builders again"
5,SOD Builders has done a great job with our massive construction project  The built us a new structure garageguesthouse and now we are in the process of renovating our yard  They have built a fence laid flagstone and are currently building a veranda  They do great work for a fair price
5,"We had to replace a a bathroom ceiling lightheatfan in our condo with no attic and had hole left in the ceiling after the electrician completed their job  Had three companies quote on this job to drywall and repaint our entire bathroom a long with repairing the peeling areas around the tile and regrouting our entire tub area
SOD Builders was the highest cost but carried all the insurance including workmans comp and was very professionaland  at the end of the dayyou get what you pay for  The work that they did was outstanding  the drywall work that they did on our ceiling is like artyou would never even know that it had been cut open  They took care of all the details and made sure that we were VERY happy and they did what they said they would do  they got the entire job done within two days where everyone one else was quoting at least five days and with multiple vendor partners  Would recommend this company and will use them again  Thank you SOD Builders for taking on this small project"
5,"SOD Builders painted the outside of our house and replaced damaged  patio deck around our pool 

We were very pleased with the end results of both jobs and would recommend SOD Builders"
5,SOD Builders redid our Master Bathroom recently They had a window of about 6 weeks to tear out the old bathroom and replace it with everything new including new plumbing electrical carpentry tiles shower basin granite counter top toilet heated floor etc We had some idea as to what we wanted for our bathroom but didnt really didnt know how to put them all together SOD Builders accommodated us on occassion having to redo work because we thought it would look better some other way Their Foreman Joes favorite response to all of our requests was not a problem just let us know what you want Oren the owner believes that the Customers satisfaction is so important that he is willing to have his workers do whatever is necessary to satisfy his customers They did all the work passed all the inspections completed the work in 6 weeks to our satisfaction One thing to us after sales service is very important How responsive is SOD Builders to a call back to refinish grouting because of shifting cracks etc Oren told us to not hesitate to call them back Im sure this will not be an issue for us
5,Love Orens work He was very professional throught the entire work I had a wall removed that divided kitchen from living room he came rightaway and gave me a quote he explained the details of the work and possible complications he also gave me an estimated time to finish which he kept Love his work right away he sent engineers got city permits and started demolition his workers were friendly and were ontime eveday clean after their work each and everyday protected my furniture from dust at the end there was several complication that occur most of which he had worn me about and he went ahead and took care of them at no extra charge will definetelly use their service again top rated on angies list too
5,"I hired SOD Builders to remodel our bathroom The entire crew was extremely courteous professional and thoughtful 
Since we had to move out of our house during this time they accommodated our needs and were flexible and understanding The workmenship was first class and the service they provided was above and beyond What I appreciated the most was that I was communicated on a daily basis what was going to happen and where we were with the progress
I will utiilze them for kitchen project in the future Thank you SOD team"
5,We hired SOD to remodel our bathroom  We interviewed three different contractors and we went with Oren   He and his workers did a great joba very reasonable cost and they were all very respectful and professional  More than anything I found that Oren was a trustworthy person as he never tried to pull anything or do anything that I had questions about   The project came off better than I had envisioned and for the total cost that he had first estimated  When we are ready to do another remodeling job we will be sure to use Oren and SOD Builders
5,"I own a company that deals with real estate investments
We are using SOD Builders INC services very often
In the last 3 years we used them for several construction projects that involve a complete renovation of a house and other maintenance works for our apartment buildings they are located conveniently in Tarzana
I must say that they never let me down Always on time very professional and courteous Fast and efficient
Overall I have to say when I see them work I get to appreciate what they do It is a hard work
I will definitely continue using them and also recommend to friends and family"
5,Replaced our roof and completed remodeling projects because of longtime water damage The projects were completed on time and on budget The workmanship was excellent SOD was truly professional and honest regarding all aspects of our projects I would highly recommend this company
5,"EXCELLENT  From start to finish Oren was a pleasure to work with and his crew was always polite and punctual and absolutely 
cleaned up after themselves each and every day  My neighbors had no idea we were doing such an extensive job in our yard
We would highly recommended SOD Builders if you are looking for any type of job and we are actually in talks right now about moving inside to start the interior"
5,"I have an AMAZING bathroom thanks to SOD Oren the owner is a sweetheart his guys were great especially Joe and his beautiful blue eyes   Joe helped put it all together kept everyone in check  The Tile guy Jaime is an artist and matched every seam framed the shower shampoo boxes as if they were a picture  The Plumber William was excellent  Oren delivered everything he promised  

I highly recommend Oren and SOD Builders I will be using them again when I renovate my other two bathrooms and kitchen which I hope will be soon"
5,"Our old disgusting kitchen was in desperate need of a remodel  We wanted everything replaced as well as two of the walls removed so that the kitchen would be more open to the rest of the house  

Oren and his team were great from the beginning  He gave us his initial quote and a completion date before he started and he stuck to both the entire time  Naturally lots of issuesfixes appeared during the remodel since we went down to studs and its an old house but Oren always took care of everything and never charged us more  His guys did an incredible job gutting the kitchen replacing the floor cabinets fixtures appliances painting tiling rewiring building a new pantry removing the old walls installing new support beams everything  His crew changed often but everybody was friendly and cleaned up as best they could at the end of each day  

There were a few things that needed to be done more than once since Oren was not present every day to supervise  we had a countertop installed wrong some crooked outlets etc  That said Oren ALWAYS immediately fixed the problem at no cost to me as soon as possible and nothing delayed the completion date we were originally given  Speaking of  Oren was always available through email he uses Basecamp phone texting etc  We never waited more than an hour for a response to our question or concern

In addition we liked Oren and his team so much we also had them replace our galvanized plumbing under the house and our electrical panel  Both were his suggestion but the decision was left to us and we never felt pressured

All in all I think the pictures speak for themselves  Our kitchen was dated and unappealing and SOD turned it into our dream kitchen at the initial price they promised and by the time they promised it by  Oren was always easy to work with his guys were friendly and we couldnt be happier with the finished result  We definitely plan to use SOD Builders again"
5,"Oren  Gil from SOD did a complete remodel of our kitchen We purchased appliances but they did everything else gutted the existing kitchen and floor installed brand new electrical plumbing floor walls and even removed a loadbearing wall to open up the kitchen to the den They took care of all of the permits inspections  fees Member Comments We interviewed 7 contractors four from word of mouth and  three through Angies list One by one they came through and spoke with us about cost design how they operated and timelines Each one either had their own idea of how they would do it or was way to high in price or just indifferent but when SOD Builders Ore  Gil stopped by they made us feel very comfortable they helped us see our vision They started right away with demo and worked quickly they seem to be very well organized and since they have their own electricians carpenters and plumbers on staff there was no waiting for the subcontractor to stop by
They had a cabinet company and tile folks that we worked with to pick out new cabinets floor tile and back splash as well as sink faucets even a pasta or potfiller over the stove They made it very carefree and they took care of every detail and didnt charge for minor change orders When we asked about the load bearing wall they were unsure until their engineer came to visit so they even gave us an estimate on the cost in advance just in case we did need to do the extra work and knowing the price upfront gave us piece of mind In fact when we did have to do the extra work they stuck to their quote 
What I really love about working with SOD Builders was their positive attitude and a willingness to make us happy and to stick with their original quote and NO SURPRISES 
We really enjoyed working with SOD and we are already getting quotes for a patio renovation"
5,"First and foremost our kitchen looks amazing  Every time we now step into it were validated that we made all the right decisions     

We recently purchased our first home which had an outdated kitchen and a backyard patio in need of improvement so we called SOD for a kitchen remodel and enclosed patio estimate  Upon first meeting Oren its clear that one word to describe him as is Confident  Confident in his abilities confident he would come in on budget and confident we would be happy with SOD in the end  And he was right  They werent the cheapest estimate but we cant imagine the quality we received at any lower price  Plus the unexpected perks we received a new linen closet extending our wall in our laundry area more than made up for a slightly higher total price  Also they were able to come down in price for the covered patio which also turned out great in order to match a competitors price and stay within our budget  

The whole process took about a month and a half they were kicked out for a week because we had our floors refinished which was very close to their original time estimate  They also kept the arduous cityinspector process as smooth as possible and Oren was always accessible by text phone or email even meeting with us on Sundays and he always gave updates throughout the remodel  

Overall it was a positive experience with a great result  We would definitely recommend to anyone looking to remodel"
5,I have SOD Builders did a remodel to our two bathrooms at the end of 2010 I had good experience with the team Compared to other two contractors I hired for other remodeling for my home 3 years ago SOD Builders were much more responsible They responded promptly stick to the budget as well As a designer myself I think they are very professional and knew the code very well And I was satisfied with the work they did I would be glad to recommend them to others
5,"I cannot recommend these guys enough Seriously my family was in the middle of a mold crisis Twice in two years The first time someone recommended that I contact Oren and I did Boy was I glad I did He came out RIGHT away helped me and my young kids took care of everything figured out what the real problem was which honestly no one else had been able to do til that point and then completely saved us He totally treated us like we were his own family Responsive quick efficient kind Knew what he was doing Had awesome guys working for him that we totally trusted When we found ourselves needing more help for different reasons  the next year I knew who to call and again he swooped in and saved us SERIOUSLY CALL HIM His prices were beyond fair and I really came to just totally depend on him I am so glad someone referred him to us and am happy to forward the favor He really made us feel safe and important and not gouged and did everything he said he would and did it well quickly what more can you ask for

btw let me add that i have referred oren to many many people now and they have all been super happy seriously he is a gem LOOK NO FURTHER"
5,SOD Builders did a complete home renovation for us new kitchen new laundry room new floors and carpets interior  exterior paint electrical rewire plumbing new doors the works The end product is beautiful wellconstructed and they were a pleasure to work with Very professional very responsive and trustworthy We look forward to working with them in the future
1,I hired this company and pd 1500 for design work for my backyard The returned work was deplorable and the company even admitted that they were having a hard time keeping designers and they had to push it out to a 3rd party After numerous calls and emails which werent returned I decided to write this off to good advertising on a sports radio show
5,"After reviewing and researching multiple landscape companies my wife and I reached out to Outdoor Makeovers to do a complete gut of our backyard and when I say gut I mean a complete demolition   Navid came out and reviewed our ideas and the current state of our backyard  He provided better alternatives in design and flow which we had not initially considered   We were very pleased and impressed with his design and knowledge and decided to move forward with the project   

The scope of our project included complete demolition two patios one raised with a fire pit new sod mulch and a build out for a hot tub  Navid provided video updates throughout the project which in total was completed in less than two weeks  For the size and scope of our project we were very impressed and almost in shock of how quickly it all came together  That just goes to show you the dedication of his team  We were very pleased with the final design and how it came to life with the complete makeover that his team delivered on  We initially held off writing this review to give time for things to settle  That said COVID set in and it actually allowed us to enjoy our new time in the backyard even more than we initially expected 

Recently we reengaged with Navid to address a minor issue with how a section of one of the patios pavers had settled  His team came back out and within the day completely remediated the issue  This goes to show that Outdoor Makeovers stands behind their craftsmanship and reaffirms the reason why we selected this company for our little paradise in our backyard

1,"After reading reviews not surprised I saw a couple others where they took consult fees under false pretenses Saw the same on another site so again how are they getting such great reviews Whether 35 or 250 deliberately taking customers consult fee is plain dishonest I lost my consult fee also with no services or usable advice given They appeared to lose interest in giving a good consult when I informed them I was getting other quotes I am sure consult fees are part of how they make moneyThe amount of excellent 5 star reviews look very suspicious especially since this was mentioned by the rep several times and the ideas were very standard and similar to other vendors Not hard to create great fake reviews for your company

Most importantly the quote was also so high it was ridiculous There are much more affordable companies out there who do great work Shop around"
5,Navid and his teams were outstanding From day one Outdoor Makeover  Living Spaces displayed exceptional creativity and project management We had a few ideas on what we wanted to do with our front and back yards but Navid and his team took what we wanted to another level Not only did their final product greatly exceed our expectations but they also turned it around quicker than first planned Our yard now has a wow factor to it  my family and I now love to be in our backyard Yes we spent a lot of money  but the quality of work and material used was 100 worth it Every member of the team worked hard and took great pride in their work  and it showed Thank you Navid and crews
5,This is our 2nd project with the outdoor team Our first project was in October 2019 and we reached out to start our 2nd project in May 2020 Working in phases helped us to stay in budget and was a great decision for us The Outdoor team had our phase 2 patio and covered pergola done by July 1 Cost for phase 2 was 39000 So about 6 weeks to complete our incredible project My favorite thing about the Outdoor crew is that every one of their workers does high quality work They truly treat your project as if they were working on their own yard Although this is an outdoor space it feels like we gained more living square footage on our house Functional comfortable and attractive it was a great way to enhance our homes value
5,This is the second time weve worked with Navid and Outdoor Makeover and once again we were thrilled with our choice This latest project involved two retaining walls a complete regrading of the backyard and added drainage new walkways and trees It was a total transformation that is both functional and beautiful and were so grateful to Navid and his team especially Eddie and Sam for taking such good care of it They were responsive respectful and incredibly thorough They also made sure our neighbor was completely happy because the retaining wall replacement involved removing and replacing some of her fence While the quote might come in a bit higher than some other places you absolutely get what you pay for in terms of the materials quality of the work and customer service We cant recommend Navid and his team at Outdoor Makeover enough
5,Navid and his crew at Outdoor Makeover just completed our big backyard landscaping project which involved moving a lot of dirt taking out trees and replanting new ones and building multiple retaining walls From the onset Navid provided great input on how to design our yard and gave realistic advise on how to save costs Our yard turned out great and far surpassed our expectations
5,I just had Outdoor Makeover put in a patio  These guys are the best  First they help you to design your space with helpful ideas that help you to end up with a finished project better then you expected  They show up on time and clean up at the end of each day  True turnkey job
5,"My backyard looks amazing the Outdoor Makeover  Living Spaces crew is very dedicated and definitely worked very very hard It is unbelievable that the work was actually completed in 2 days The communication between Navid Brian his foreman and the crew was excellent 
A minor issue was quickly corrected to my satisfaction The price was reasonable not cheap but the money is wellworth it My only criticism would be the time between hiring and beginning of the work With that stated we did hire Outdoor Makeover  Living Spaces in the midst of the COVID pandemic when most people were working on landscaping and property renovation We would definitely hire the team for future projects"
5,Navid and team are great to work with They are professional thorough and ontime We had them redo our front yard and walkway which turn out beautiful This is our second project with the team and we would recommend them again and again
5,Great experience We met with Navid for the initial consultation He was very thorough and gave us ideas for the backyard we never considered The consultation was well worth the cost and because he helped in the design process the finished product was much better than I initially expected The initial design was a bit more expensive than we were willing to pay so Navid worked with us to get the design within our budget  We actually settled on a design a bit below our budget and he advised us to budget an extra X for unknowns that could happen while under construction That was really helpful because as the project progressed there were a few additions and changes that really helped make the finished product better than expected Once the project began Navid stayed connected and I saw him regularly When the crews arrived without Navid each of the different leads he assigned for demolition Ivan construction Gerardo  and the landscape Giovanni had intimate knowledge of
5,After reading several outstanding reviews we contacted Outdoor Makeover to seek help in transforming our wooded backyard into a landscape that we could use and enjoy  From the moment we contacted them initially speaking with Tina we realized and experienced their wonderful customer service  very friendly and clientcentered  This was perhaps the most important quality we were seeking in working with a landscape company and Outdoor Makeover excelled in this area from beginning to end  We experienced the professionalism and workmanship of Outdoor Makeover as second to none  We recommend Outdoor Makeover without reservation and would gladly give them more than 5 stars and are grateful to have worked with the Outdoor Makeover team and experience their fantastic customer service and work
5,We had a wonderful experience with KraftMaster Renovations  The entire team were fantastic to work with  We enjoyed having 247 access to the team and all job information via their platform  Everyone on the team was attentive friendly professional and talented at their job  Having our kitchen renovated Carly designed a great plan and Chris the project manager was there with us every step of the way and always popped by if we needed him  We work mostly from home and found it to be a smooth process for the job to take place during our work hours  We never felt out of the loop or waiting for answers  If there were even the smallest touch ups or changes they would return asap and handle  Shout out to Steve Nick  Robbie  great job guys  Plus Chris and the electrician team  Highly recommended
5,"It is without hesitation that I provide a recommendation for KraftMaster Renovations KraftMaster and their team  KraftMaster exceeded our expectation at every stage and delivered ontime  Over the entire length of the project KraftMaster met each weekly deliverable and it was clear what the next steps were  KraftMasters lead designer Maureen was incredible to work with  She is a great listener and picked up exactly what we were looking for  an open space with the ability to close off certain areas for privacy  The transformation of the space is beyond words   I remember at our initial meeting Maureen commented that we had plenty of room to meet our needs I was skeptical but she definitely proved me wrong  
Alexandra was simply amazing at sourcing things and being very practical  We were looking for a set of custom glass sliders which were well beyond what we budgeted for however she was able to find a much more reasonable set of glass sliders which gave the aesthetic of exactly what we were looking for   We loved all the trades that were involved in our project  Each one of them were very professional and it was evident that they each took a lot of pride in doing the work carefully and going above and beyond to deliver  At the project outset Bob had a team meeting with all the trades to go through the project open up a few walls to determine if there were any issues at the beginning  At this point we were introduced to our project manager Chris  Chris was always reachable and very responsive  He was great at problem solving and made a great suggestion about tile we had chosen to go around the fireplace   The job site was cleaned up every day and all trades were great at answering all my questions  Our carpenter team consistently mostly of Peter and Walter  Not only are they both incredible at their work both of them were so pleasant to be around  I enjoyed my daily chats with both of them   I was very impressed with how they hung our fireplace mantle which consisted of a reclaimed solid piece of barnwood which probably weighed close to 600 lbs  The plumbers were great  Moon Danny  Mike are very good at what they do  They even diagnosed that our plumbing lines in our laundry room were crossed for the washing machine so when we thought we were using cold water we were in fact using hot water  I was impressed with their work ethic that if they found something that wasnt right they were going to address it  The electricians also went above and beyond  The team consisted of Chris Nick and Renan  Their work was incredibly neat it was evident that they took no short cuts in running lines back to the main junction box  The tiling expert Bogden is a true artisan  He would spend hours laying out the tiles first before he cut anything to ensure everything lined up perfectly  

KraftMaster transformed our space to our needs and we thoroughly enjoy it every day"
5,"Kraftmaster crated a beautiful bathroom for us from a connected room to our master bedroom The room and the side of the house it was on had no plumbing but the Moon Danny and Mike did a great job analyzing how to best get pipes to the room Krftmaster provides a full service construction service and it starts with interviews and then design Carly listed to what we wanted out of the renovation and then provided us with 3 different designs with different budgets to choose from We then went shopping together to work together to pick out the tiles counter materials sinks toilets fixtures etc They have lots of knowledge around these things and can answer any question

As the project commenced it was great to see a project plan we had access to and could communicate with the team Chris was our project manager and Steve was our goto for whatever it was that was needed at a moments notice The project started ontime and during a difficult time of year when we had multiple snowstorms that made roads underivable and many areas with power outages This affected the schedule a bit but delays were communicated and justified and they werent that long

The carpenters and electricians did great work Chris Nick and Renan are precise electricians  every screw on the switch plates is aligned upanddown which just shows you their attention to detail and the tile work was amazing Bogdan is an incredibly skilled and throughout tileperson and spent considerable time on the mud job and tile work Super precise

What was great was that near the end of the job we werent 100 happy with the alignment of a towlrack we made some changes to plans during construction and the carpenter who installed it didnt see the update it happens and I pointed it out to Chris who agreed it should be fixed It wasnt an easy fix as the tiles had to be broken off and replaced the the bar realigned but they did it and it promptly 

The end result is a perfect bathroom that suits the home

Im already planning a second project with Kraftmaster"
5,"Where can I begin  This whole process has been organized trustworthy smooth and remarkable Using KraftMaster for our recent master bathroom renovation was the best decision weve made and we know exactly who to call for the next project  We are now enjoying the bathroom we have always wanted

We have a 1928 Tudorstyle house so it was important to make updates that reflect the style of this house  Carly and Bob took their time with us at the beginning as we carefully figured out how to achieve a spacious master bathroom with a tub shower double sink vanity and walkin closet  This was a HUGE project as we went into a spare room to create a master walkin closet They were very creative and mindful of our budget and allowed us to make decisions that we were comfortable with Carly held my hand with the designs from start to finish in a way that was fun and supportive shes amazing  Nick Robbie and Carlos made the project come to life and I am so grateful for them When the job was finished I missed seeing them The plumbing crew Moon Danny and Mike do such great work we have called them back to help us out with other issues that have come up Steve Chris and Alexandra round out this awesome team with friendly service and work ethic that is hard to come by these days

I am so grateful that Bob and his team took on this HUGE project and gave us the bathroom of our dreams  It truly is a showstopper  Thanks KraftMaster You will be hearing from us sooner than you think "
5,"We contracted with KraftMaster Renovations in 2020 to renovate our 1960s kitchen  We couldnt have made a better choice  The entire process was almost flawless  Carly our designer immediately understood our style and goals guiding us through the selection of materials  Chris our project manager and Alexandra our project coordinator kept the schedule running perfectly with minimal delays in spite of Covid
Carpenters Peter and Walter plumbers Danny Moon and Mike electricians Chris Ryan and Renan all did an excellent job bringing the design to life
We will certainly call Bob Gockeler and Kraftmaster for our next project"
5,"We were very pleased with the work of KraftMaster Renovations We hired them for a second floor reconfiguration redoing nearly 90 year old bathrooms and in turn slightly reconfiguring two bedrooms They also helped us with installing HVAC in our home From the day Bob and Julie walked into our home for a consultation to the celebratory day they picked up the floor protection their team treated our house and our family with great respect They supported our desire to stay in keeping with the house and as they noticed certain design features of our home suggested we incorporate them into our renovations For example we have a lot of crown molding in our home and instead of ripping it off and throwing it away they suggested they put it back after door frames were put back on That is one example of their thoughtfulness and consideration during our renovations 
Maureen helped us design beautiful space Nick and his team Moon and his team and Chris and his team were kind and respectful guided us well clearly communicated what they were doing and when it came up what surprises we were faced with only one major one Their work is impeccable and we continually enjoy our home and new spaces We highly recommend their work and do plan to use them for future projects"
5,"I have had the pleasure of working with Bob and Julie on two major projects  One a kitchen renovation and more recently a whole house overhaul which included  gutting and updating a kitchen three bathrooms and redesigning some of the floor plan so it would work better for our family 

 Kudos to Maureen who helped me achieve the modern farmhouse feel that we were hoping for  She and her assistant Alexandra were  a pleasure to work with patiently walking us through every decision we had to make and there were plenty  

The construction crews starting with the demolition right on through to finish carpentry are a talented bunch always friendly respectful and doing their best to bring the project to life  

I highly recommend Bob Julie and their team for any renovation project you might have in mind"
5,"From the moment we met with Bob Julie and Maureen through to completion they made us feel at ease We had an idea of how we wanted our kitchen to look but by partnering with Kraftmasters they were able to keep us focused on what was important while building the kitchen weve always wanted all on schedule My wife and I constantly look back at our inspiration picture and are amazed by how similar it looks 

A few reasons why Kraftmasters stands out from other home renovation companies
 They do what they say
 Theyre transparent
 They care about their customers happiness

I would strongly recommend Kraftmasters to anyone tackling a home renovation project"
5,KraftMaster was a wonderful designbuild team to work with  They handled the pandemic by always keeping us informed and working safely in our home  They are hands down the cleanest contractors we have ever worked with and they honestly treated our home as if it was their own  Wed especially like to thank Carly Chris and Matt for helping us through every stage of the project and for being so accommodating and professional  Our new bathroom is perfect and we couldnt imagine a better end result
5,The bestest of all Highly recommend this company Very professional Top class this Team has very experienced people when it comes to designing estimating cost and building
5,"TO BEGIN Our Kitchen Remodel Is OUTSTANDING  VERY BEAUTIFUL 

We have a 250 year old house  are very protective of her good  historically appropriate care Our OLDE small kitchen needed careful modernizing  my husband  I were stumped as to what to do within our small space 

I began visiting kitchen redesign house remodeling businesses to see who I might find One fall day I stopped into KraftMaster Renovations store front  was met by 3 generations of the Gockeler family I had no appointment but they gave me time They listened  gave me a rare sense of being in good hands  Id only just met them I went home  told my husband I think Ive found the right people for our historic kitchen remodel Following our 1st meeting my husband was fully on board So we began 

Design meetings with Bob Gockeler  Maureen Madigan began in our small kitchen During that first meeting Bob  Maureen moved us to solutions wed never considered  we were excited As we worked the design they both took us into  through great buying choices  great solutions due to good  creative problem solving  we were a team 

Demolition began late summer  we were essentially done in December Every member of their team was TIP TOP  I ALWAYS felt comfortable when they were in our home I experienced a rarelyfeltinNJ courtesy from every member of their team  they always left the premises inside  out tidy  clean  everyone was a hard worker

SPECIFICALLY 
I met Robbie Geckeler  Matt Carlson with their deliveries  on site work They were as I experienced with the entire team so courteous friendly  hard working 
The carpentry on our project was I believe uniquely challenging and their team was superb Their Master Carpenter Chris Stevens was superlative in his care talent  skill as was his team Lead Carpenter Tyler Cornelissen  Apprentice Cam Kennedy 
It was a pleasure to meet  work with Julie Geckeler who managed communications  scheduling I really liked the online project management tool CoConstruct Meetings in their new office  showroom assisted our decisions I shifted my countertop choice at one such visit while perusing one of their lovely displays 
At the end of our project I met Alexandra Grosser  Bobs daughter for the photo shoot true professionals  ALL  
I want to cycle back to Bob Geckeler  Maureen Madigan to say Thank You We couldnt have done this without you Your creativity professionalism kindness  hard work were always present And I must add FUN  This was a FUN PROJECT

We thank your entire team  your entire family Everyone who walks into our new kitchen for the first time gasps literally  says its SO Beautiful  Because it is 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH"
5,"A First Class Company that Exceeded Expectations

Our family is thrilled with our recent kitchen remodel from KraftMaster Renovations  Bob and his team transformed our kitchen from closedoff and dated to the open modern center of our home  It has transformed the feel of the entire house  It is something our family will enjoy and can be very proud of 

Simply put the team is world class  knowledgeable relentlessly hardworking talented friendly respectful and clean Kims design turned out to be a perfect combination of form and function with small thoughtful details that add wonderful unique touches  Her design was brought to life by Peter and Walter whose expert carpentry work served well to highlight the quality of the material and Bobby whose meticulous and beautiful tilework has thus far received Wow comments from all that visit  There were many others that we grew to know over the course of the project  from Robbie and Matt who were key to executing the logistics of the project to Moon plumbing who on multiple occasions made sure to work around our toddler who was at home on certain days  

Wed be remiss not to mention Julie  who made certain that we were updated each step of the way  She communicated nearly each day which kept us informed and comforted that the project was progressing towards a timely completion   

We are fully satisfied and plan to be repeat customers  They made certain that the remodel was exactly what we wanted  no detail was too small  You wont regret hiring Kraftmaster for your project"
5,Bob and Team are great  I used KraftMaster for my large kitchen remodel project in Summer 2018  The project took 25 months  While this company is not the cheapest quote they really do keep to their timeline and professionalism  Many times contractors will lose interest or start another job and never finish  Not KraftMaster and even towards the end of the project i never felt like i was a secondary thought to them  They remained on schedule and finished on time  They maintained good contact and updates throughout the project  The main project managers Peter and Walter were so courteous and professional  Would definitely recommend this firm to anyone in the area looking to do a large or small remodel
5,"The 2 things that come to mind working with Kraftmaster are craftsmanship and professionalism In the past Ive worked with contractors that were really good in one of those areas but lacked in the other 

The team was excellent to work with Maureen is a true design talent She took the time to get to know my wife and I to get a better understanding of the aesthetic we were looking for She guided us through the big picture design comp process down to the little fixture details There were a couple of instances where it took some extra prodding on her part to get us to purchase detail that was out of our original scope and budget but she has a way of explaining how the extra investment would enhance the overall look Glad we took her advice

Our lead contractor Chris was a true professional He was pleasant to work with and highly skilled at the work He came up with some creative solutions on a couple of items which were initially a concern for us He made sure to address some of the call outs that I had throughout the build process The final implementation was excellent

Julie was very helpful answering questions and making sure information was relayed back to the team 

Chris and the electrical team were great Very responsive to some adjustments that needed to be made along the process 

As the company owner I was pleasantly surprised how involved Bob was throughout He didnt sell the project and then disappear He was communicative during the entire process When we hit a roadblock on the project Bob worked with me to find a solution 

Overall a great time I recommended them to some good friends who have also started a major remodel project with Kraftmaster"
5,Bob and team were excellent from Day 1  We decided to go with Bobs team because of his patience and his one stop shop team  A large reno like ours can be very intimidating  We also live in an HOA community so there are additional rules and guidelines that Bob and team had to become familiar with  The team had all sorts of excellent design ideas and helped us narrow things down when we got overwhelmed with choices  The designer  construction crew electrician and everyone else involved were personable professional and trustworthy  We love our new kitchen
5,"Bob and the KraftMaster team turned our house built in 1903 into the home we always knew it could be  The team really helps you through the project from beginning to end  The design process went smoothly and logistical coordination was quite impressive  Everything was always there on time and highly organized  For our primary points of contact Id like to specifically say a few words about

Kim was a huge help as the designer for our project  She took the rough ideas for our layout and flushed them out with better ideas and a smarter use of space  Especially for our master bath and walkin closet which had an odd shaped room due to the dormer  It was definitely the smartest way to layout the bathroom and optimized my wifes walk in closet  

When it came to picking out countertops tile and fixtures thank God we had Kim  It would have taken us a dozen trips and several fights to get to the decisions we made in two  Kim had great ideas but also gave us the space we needed to make our own decisions  It was a good balance  

Kim was also very responsive to our daily communications and what seemed like a thousand Change Orders  She was great at answering questions and allaying any concerns that we had  Overall Kim was a huge reason our project turned out so great  

Nick is an amazing craftsman  He is super knowledgeable with incredible attention to detail  I really appreciated this  Our house was built in 1903 and we wanted to match the detailed molding throughout the rest of the house  I can only image the pain that was  He was also great at dealing with and suggesting solutions to the charm aka problems that these old houses present  I really couldnt imagine the house turning out better  It is a work of art  

Did we hit small bumps in the road  Sure but every project does and those bumps were taken care of quickly  We are very happy with the project and look forward to spending many years in our home with our family creating memories"
5,When we purchased our home we knew that we wanted to renovate the kitchen and family room space to open it up and give it a better flow We researched several local companies and settled on KraftMaster Renovations We had an idea of what we were looking to do but with the help of Bob Kim and their team we were able to realize the dream of our perfect kitchen space From start to finish we were kept in the loop about timeline changes new ideas and everyone was responsive to our questions and changes We are so happy with our new kitchen and highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations to anyone we know looking to renovate
5,We have worked with Bob and his team on multiple projects  The first project was a transformative kitchen remodel where not only did the team reimagine the space in ways we would never have thought possible the ideas they had for finishes and the final design exceeded all of our expectations  Our latest project was a technical siding replacement of tongue and groove cedar in a 1978 architect designed home and the results again exceeded our expectations  Bobs onsite crews are skilled and always professional  Bob himself is incredibly experienced very open to new ideas with amazing contacts and resources for the most unusual materials Case in point the glass backsplash behind the stove  An original photo taken by my husband transformed   If you can imagine it he can bring it to life  He also has great rapport with local inspectors and townships which enables the smooth execution of  projects
5,"When my wife and I decided to renovate our kitchen bathroom and other parts of our house we set out to find someone who could capture our style which is a bit unorthodox provide high quality craftsmanship and do so within our budget expectations   KraftMaster Renovations absolutely delivered  

As my wife and I started the process we were fortunate that we share a common design aestheticsort of a fusion of MidCentury Modern and European Modern  We however were also aware that this style is not that common in Northern New Jersey  As we met with other design and build companies many struggled to grasp the design elements that we sought and often redirected us to more traditional lines cabinetry fixtures and colors  However after meeting Bob and seeing his portfolio of work we thought that KraftMaster Renovations would be able to capture the look we wanted

Our confidence was absolutely rewarded  Maureen our designer at KraftMaster did a perfect job fusing our ideas together into a cohesive design that not only is beautiful but also practical in its layout and space optimization  Maureen also displayed incredible patience with us or with me to be more precise as we modified some of the original design work after demolition revealed some issues with the house  

As our project moved into the construction phase we were exceptionally impressed by the craftsmanship and attention to detail of all the tradesmen  Nick Carlos and Camilo the primary carpenters are perfectionists  This is evident in their own work as well as their expectations of products purchased for the projectrejecting cabinets tiles hardware that were not perfect  Danny the primary plumber and Chris the primary electrician provided excellent work that was obviously done with care and pride  

Throughout the entire process Bob was always involved and always responsive  Early in the project he proposed alternatives that could save us some money or told us that certain items were unnecessary expenses  As the project advanced he helped provide some creative solutions to structural issues that surfaced during demolition  As the project was winding down Bob made sure that we were pleased with everything and made sure that any final adjustments were done to our satisfaction  

Based on our experience we highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations due to its quality of work and level of service  And if your design preferences are more modern than traditional you should absolutely meet with KraftMaster Renovations before starting your renovation or remodeling project"
5,Bob Gockeler Maureen Madigan and the entire KraftMaster Renovations Team is setting the standard that all contractors and home remodel companies should strive for  ACCOUNTABILITYPROFESSIONALISMDOING THE RIGHT THINGEXTRAORDINARY SERVICEEXPERTISE  A COMMITMENT TO STICKING TO WHAT WAS AGREED UPON are some of the A qualities we received in working with the KraftMaster Team  Not only are we in love with our full bathroom remodel but we know with complete certainty knowing that the work was completed correctly  The design concept for the small space was something we could not have envisioned and the end result was even more gorgeous that what we anticipated One of things that impressed us most is that the team stayed on schedule  When I share that fact with friends and family they are blown away Day 1 of the project they arrived when expected and left as agreed upon through the end of the project  This is how they were able to standby the time frame we had originally discussed  We really enjoyed working with the team and look forward to working with them again
5,I  highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations  The toughest part of my kitchen renovation MayJune 2016 was packing up 60 years of my moms grandmothers and my appliances and dishes to make way for the KraftMaster guys to get to work I moved back into my childhood home after my mom passed away a few years prior to the renovation and was happy I chose Bob Maureen and their team to turn my moms kitchen into my own  In keeping with the style of the midcentury Cape we expanded the kitchens storage capacity and enhanced its cottage ambiance with Shakerstyle cabinetry finished in Marshmallow Cream Subtle wood grain porcelain plank floor tiles a beautiful Cambria Quartz countertop highlighted by a Pumice subway tile backsplash carried my 1941 Cape into the 21st century without sacrificing its midcentury modern footprint and charm  Everyone whos seen it cant believe the transformation From day one the guys showed up every day to gut install tile drywall and plaster The exceptionally skilled tilers often stayed late to finish a job  It was such a pleasure working with designer Maureen Bob son Robbie and their team that I am planning to continue working with them on upcoming jobs as well
5,I recently had my kitchen and bathroom renovated by KraftMaster  Im thrilled with the redo  Working the Kim the designer and Bob was exactly what I was looking for  guidance on various ideas with best practices incorporated  The work crew obviously care about their work as everything was done with top notch quality  They were flexible by working around some unique challenges  Everything was planned well and the work went along smoothly  KraftMaster was exactly the type of contractor that I was looking for  Thank you to the entire team  I love my new spaces
5,Having never undergone a major renovation we were very apprehensive about the entire kitchen renovation process  However we cant say enough about Bob Gockeler and his entire team  Bob and Kim were extremely involved responsive and helpful in every aspect of the project from the design stage to picking out fixtures to the final small details that we would never have even thought of They were beyond patient with all of our questions and went above and beyond to ensure that we were happy and confident in the choices that  were made  The Crew that worked on the kitchen were professionals in every sense of the word  Their work was top quality they were friendly left the work area clean and were very easy to have around  The final result was beyond what we had hoped for  Our kitchen is beautiful  We would highly recommend working with Kraftmaster Renovations
1,Last Fall my wife and I met with Bob and Kim a few times and our experience was so poor that I want to come back to this because the overwhelmingly positive reviews on Houzz simply do not capture the complete picture on their business  Rather than go through a detailed blow by blow of our experience I think its more valuable to Houzz users that I just get to the bottom line  In our view Bob is a charming guy who markets a designbuild offering in which customers end up over paying for the product they end up getting  An argument could be made that youre paying to have one stop shop and your hand held  Having said that the proposal we got from Bob was so generalized in terms of the design detail that it was just not useful if you want a high end product when it comes to cabinetry and carpentry it is ALL about the details  So we decided to go shop  Immediately two things became clear  One most kitchen design specialists understand that you have to get very detailed in the design unless you want a fairly pedestrian product  Two we would be able to get a much better quality cabinetfinishoverall productproject for roughly speaking 20 percent less than what was quoted by Bob  Now that our project is 97 done I can tell you by experience that this is exactly what we achievedwe got a vastly better overall end product for substantially less money
5,"Bob you may not realize this about me but I am a perfectionistinterior design junkie  Having been called on one or two occasions by people close to me that I am a control freak which I do take as a compliment  Details details details its my mantra  focusing on how I can manage the what ifs in any situation  It gives me great comfort knowing my actions can affect the outcomes to situations I have control for  So you can only imagine the amount of TRUST and CONFIDENCE I placed in you and your team  After doing my due diligence research to assure I was going to get exactly what I had hoped and dreamed for which happened to be 10 years in the making  I was placing  No pressure on you  right  Well I can wholeheartedly state  You completely exceeded my expectations I feel like I am in a design magazine every time I enter my kitchen  It is truly breathtaking and extremely functional
Communication  it is a valuable cornerstone of your performance  You kept us abreast of every situation  and they are bound to occur in a house that is over 50 years old   Your suggestions for solutions gave us options which appealed to my sensibilities 
Your team of professionals were remarkable and it is our privilege to acknowledge them
Kims design ideas along with her education on products and materials gave us the intelligence to make important decisions  She is so sweet a pleasure to work with  I miss coming to the showroom to go over the plan with her
Andrews work ethic is one for the record books  His boundless energy and determination to get my kitchen done was his ultimate priority  We felt so lucky to be in his infallible hands  A true craftsman
Maynar and his cousin are flooring geniuses  Their talent of feathering in the new kitchen hardwood to the dining room is unbelievable  The stain color is so rich and the steps are gorgeous  
Robbie your son is a wonderful Project Manager  His attention to detail is phenomenal his diligence to protect our floors when the appliances arrived surely saved us from catastrophe  He is a personable young man with great communication skills apple didnt fall far from the tree  
Integrity Quality Experience Reliable Talented   these are some of the words that we associate with KraftMaster Renovations   To those who are embarking on this journey of home renovation you couldnt be in more capable hands  I know you will be truly astonished with their capabilities  we are"
5,"Kitchen first and now the Living Room

After Bob Gockeler and his incredible KraftMaster crew finished work on our Kitchen see review from October 2015 it was only natural to move on to the living room Weve been busy relaxing in our new space so it has taken a while to write this review

Once again everyone at KraftMaster exceeded expectations while keeping the project within budget  From Maureen and Kims design suggestions and drawings to Robbie Gockelers Bobs son project setup and support to the fine craftsmanship and attention to detail by Bobs subcontractorsnot to mention our additions to the projectwe were totally satisfied  Cant wait to start work on the upstairs"
5,"Review of Master Bath Renovation by Kraftmasters

Summary
Very pleased with both the design and construction of the new master bath
Kraftmasters was the most creative contractor we spoke with when trying to come up with a design to fit in our fairly difficult space constraints
The work crew was attentive to our home and made every effort to minimize the disruption
The workmanship was top notch
The end result was just what we had hoped for

Discussion

We spoke with several contractors about renovating our master bath  The problem was we had a dressing area with a sink and a closet and a separate bath with another sink a toilet and a bath tub with shower  We wanted a separate walk in shower but the configuration of the rooms made it a real challenge to design a renovation without making undesirable concessions  Bob and Kim were the only contractordesigners who said they could up with a plan to meet our needs and they did  We brainstormed with Bob and Kim and together we came up with a creative design that had a walkin shower and separate room for the toilet a tub and a reoriented closet with an entrance from the master bedroom rather than the bath

Kim not only came up with the initial overall design she provided very helpful input to assist us in making all the detailed design decisions  Kim went shopping with us at vendors recommended by Bob for granite counter tops floor tile and bathroom fixtures  We were able to select our cabinets right in Bobs showroom in Chatham and the cabinets are very attractive and well made

The job was started promptly  Bob arranged for the construction permit and scheduled the needed inspections  The first step in the project was to put down protective material in the garage where the construction material was stored on the stairs and in the master bedroom to minimize the impact of the construction on the areas near the construction  It is construction so there is still going to be a considerable amount of dust and dirt it is unavoidable

Bobs work crew were all friendly and knew what they were doing  Tony the foreman did most of the plumbing and the layout of the framing  He was very attentive to detail and consulted with us when he thought there was a decision to be made  Yuri did a number of jobs and did them well but he really showed his talent as the tile installer  He did a super job installing the tile in the shower the tile around the tub and the river pebble floor in the shower

Towards the end the job took a bit longer than anticipated as Bob had a number of jobs going at the same time and so the crew was not as available to us as they had been when the project was started  Bob gave us a quote at the start of the project and the quote was only changed for areas that we agreed to  The total cost of the project was somewhat over our initial budget but we felt that it was worth the extra cost to get all of what we wanted

Upon completion we could not have been more pleased  The workmanship was top notch the design works as planned and is very pleasing to us and all the detailed design decisions came together to create a Master Bath that we thoroughly enjoy"
5,KraftMaster Renovations is an amazing company and we always enjoy working with them They are extremely efficient passionate and they truly go above and beyond
5,Bob Gockeler and his team at KraftMaster Renovations are magicians  After living in our 30 year old home for 12 years we decided to undertake a massive master bathcloset renovation This soon expanded to a new foyer staircase and hardwood floor refinishing A three month project  From the very first meeting with Bobs crack design team of Kim and Maureen we were hooked  Kim and Maureen were able to translate our conflicting jumbled list of ideas into a workable plan suggesting viable alternatives to our non workable ideas and giving rise to new thoughts through their design expertise Once construction started Andrew and Igor  young men who were obviously master craftsmen far ahead of what their ages would suggest were on the job They epitomized professionalism Tremendously talented and a pleasure to have work in our home When the time came to finish the hardwood floors and the newly rebuilt staircase in the foyer Bob revealed his wizard of hard wood  Eugene Eugene is a Rembrandt in terms of matching new stain with that first put down 30 years ago  They blend seamlessly  Every day Bob Gockeler was on site reviewing and inspecting the progress making sure that the work held up to his very high standards which far surpassed ours as homeowners When complete the team retreated as if they had never been on site the worksite was clean all debris removed Not a day goes by that we dont remark how much we love this new addition  Thank you Bob
5,The master bathroom is perfect Nicole at Wayne Tile was knowledgable and professional She helped me pick out the perfect carrera marble in one day Andrew did an amazing job installing it He is truly talented We are very happy with the Perrin and Rowe fixtures that Kim helped us to select
5,All of the people associated with Kraftmaster are professional and give the utmost care to detail  No item is too small to be given huge attention  The utmost care was given to my entire home throughout our renovation  Everyone was on time and always delivered exactly what they promised  Every renovation causes an interruption to your normal household flow this one was almost undetectable thanks to the entire crew  Great Job Kraftmaster
5,"We have been doing business with KraftMaster RenovationsKitchen Intuitions for several years They are knowledgeable efficient and  clientfocused
They are a pleasure to work with and possess a professionalism that instills confidence  GlassCrafters Inc"
5,"My husband Frank and I decided it was time to completely remodel our kitchen  We initially met with two different kitchenbath designers  For various reasons we were not satisfied with what they were proposing  We had passed by Kitchen Intuitions in Chatham NJ and decided to stop into their shop  That is when we met owner Bob GockelerKraftMasters Renovations  We set up an appointment with Bob and his designer Kim to discuss our kitchen remodel  We immediately knew that their professionalism enthusiasm and creativity set them apart from the other kitchen companies

They were extremely thorough in addressing all our kitchen needs  They accompanied us when we chose the granite and backsplash  Bob and Maureen made sure that we made the right lighting decisions  Bob and his entire team always made sure there was a constant line of communication making the whole experience a pleasant one

Once the demolition occurred they were extremely careful to keep the dust confined to the work area   Within a very timely fashion our new kitchen was completed  The quality of the workmanship was superb  For the first time after completing a project in our home we can highly recommend KraftMasters Renovations"
5,The KraftMaster team was nothing short of top notch I would hire them again in a heartbeat From design thru finish Bob  Kim were professional on time on budget creative and very user friendly text email etc I felt that I was informed every step of the way I was particularly impressed with their attention to detail and willingness to suggest alternatives that might not add to the value Most contractors try to upsell you on specific items where I felt like Kraftmaster was a partner in the process A team would highly recommend their work
5,We hired KraftMaster Renovations to design and install a new expanded kitchen in our 125 yearold Victorian home  They did a wonderful job  The design process was thorough and detailed  The installation was quick and professional with outstanding attention to the detail of the moulding and trim  Selection of granite and tile went so smoothly I shouldnt have spent the hours on my own at the tile store looking at random tiles  Our family loves the kitchen which can now accommodate five sitting at the center island
5,"Kraftmaster is an excellent company providing their customers with everything they need to complete their kitchen or bathroom renovations They are great to work with as well as open to innovative products and ideas which make any project come alive From traditional elegance to cutting edge contempory look no further than Kraftmaster Renovations

5,"Kraftmaster Renovation is an excellent company to work with Starting with the Owner Bob to every person on his team they are all very professional  
From the design phase all the way through final closeout they have one goal in mind which is  To give their clients the highest quality job possible

As an Architect who has worked with Kraftmaster on dozens of projects I always feel confident that the job is being done in accordance with plans and at a very high level of quality"
5,"We are currently collaborating with Bob and Kim on a new kitchen as a part of a wholehouse renovation and addition in new Providence The service and communication has been pleasant and professional We look forward to the transformation

Thank you

5,We are so thrilled with the way our kitchen turned out  From the beginning Bob and his team were very thoughtful had great suggestions and asked tons of questions to build a kitchen according to the needs of our lifestyle  The work they did was impeccable and kept us in the loop of when everything was going to be done  We were nervous because of all the bad stories you hear about renovations but we had no problems nor delays  A much better experience than we could have imagined coupled with the end result made us want to do more including our family room and powder room We would recommend Kraftmaster for their thoroughness communication and excellent work  Thanks Bob and team
5,"Our experience with Kraftmaster Renovations has been fantastic There are many people who own their own company but Bob Gockeler is much more than an owner  he is a leader and the people who work for him follow his example Bob has so much integrity and is a person of his word That might sound like fluff but its not  its absolutely true He has an amazing attention to detail follows through on everything that he says he will do and makes great suggestions and recommendations without being judgmental or pushy Whats so amazing  because its so rare  is that he has managed to assemble an entire company of likeminded people that truly care about the quality of their work

Everyone who works for this company is great at what they do and is a true professional If we had to pick 3 things that make Kraftmaster different from everyone else wed say 1 They genuinely care about the quality of your project from beginning to end 2 Unlike so many construction companies that use subs they employ their work crews so you see the same teams of workers throughout your project 3 Their work crews are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet and put in a full days work every day allowing your project to get done on time 

We would not hesitate to use Kraftmaster again  in fact we cant imagine using anyone else"
5,"Bob  Co did an incredible transformation in our beautiful old 1800s house with a 1970s era kitchen Of all the people we interviewed he was the most straightforward with budget deadlines etc 

What neither of us anticipated was the previous owners that did the 70s renovation on the kitchen did so without permits or skill and because of moisture damages Bob had the fun job of figuring out how to gut the ENTIRE kitchen down to the dirt and up to the ceiling I cant stress enough how diligent and fair he was in figuring out how to achieve this without completely breaking the bank We feel that if we would have chosen any other company we would have been left in the dust literally  

In the process we turned lemons into lemonade and moved some walls around added a wet bar switched the bath and Laundry rooms and he took on all the challenges gloriously Hes not one to bark orders either while disgruntled workers do his bidding he gets in there and does some of the work himself not afraid of getting his hands dirty Hes also really thoughtful about solving problems and I never saw him lose his cool during the entire process His design partner Kim also helped us figure out the layout colors finishes etc and agreed to meet us at showrooms on weekends nights or whenever we wanted

Bob also worked really well with our flooring and insulation companies to time everything out and organize what needs to happen and when

So now we have an incredibly beautiful new kitchen on a solid foundation a new bathroom laundry room and because of removing a wall in another part of the house a beautiful open concept living room He even mounted our TV 

Well definitely use Kraftmasters again for our future renovations watch out 70s master bathroom and would highly recommend them to whoever needs a competent friendly hardworkingtruetohisword contractor"
5,KraftMaster Renovations remodeled our kitchen and did a fabulous job  We interviewed several companies and Bob was able to give us our dream kitchen  The KraftMaster team was very professional and neat  They cleaned up each and every day which is a major plus  I would recommend KraftMaster to everyone
5,Let me start by saying that the work that Bob and his team did on my kitchen bathrooms and various other rooms is simply beautiful This is a team of professionals  and I stress the word professionals  that go above and beyond to make sure that your vision comes to fruition Never at any time did we hear the words  cant be done  This company truly cares about the work they do and it shows I also must add that during the entire process every time we reached out to Bob with a question or concern he was always available to talk which is hugely important while going thru a renovation I would never under any circumstance consider doing any work in my house without Bob and KraftMaster leading the way
5,"KraftMaster Renovations completed our kitchen renovation and we cannot be more delighted with the outcome  They were able to open up the area between the kitchen and dining room as well as replacing a window with a French door to the outside to make for a beautiful and  functional space that has a better flow and is overall a big improvement to our quality of life in our house  

Bob was always sensitive and responsive to any questions or suggestions and his designer Robin had the vision that  considered our desires while making sure that the final outcome was functional and lovely

Christine"
5,We had our kitchen renovated several years ago and in the process also had all the flooring in our home replaced with a laminate flooring  The results are fantastic  I love the new kitchen design layout which included a slight change to the flow through the house  Its just awesome  The quality and workmanship is great and was done within our budget
5,"As the father of a severely mentally and physically handicapped son we constantly face disappointment When we required a bathroom to be  customized and build a walk in shower without any barriers allowing our son to be wheeled directly in the quotes and contractors we met with were either uninterested lacked imagination or the credentials Our last meeting was with Bob He and his extraordinary crew of craftsmen spent hours discussing drawing and reviewing the project Regardless of the unexpected obstacles they faced they remained steadfast and undeterred in ensuring the project remained on time and on budget In fact when a vendor priced a product too low Kraftmaster kept to their contractual and ethical standards and automatically paid the higher price instead of handcuffing us and making us pay Their team never missed a day worked weekends never left to work on another job and Bob constantly visited to ensure that no stone was left unturned Furthermore the bathroom will appeal to those who are non handicapped due to the innovative design and finishing details No I am not related to Bob No Bob did not pay me or promise to do work nocharge for this recommendation There is often a disconnect in the construction world between work ethics and morals Therefore I wrote this because it doesnt cost a penny to say something nice for an excellent company  especially when it had such an important impact on our sons quality of life If you dont believe me visit Bobs site to see our bathroom or ask Bob to see our bathroom and meet our son

5,"Bob and his team at KraftMaster Renovations did a brilliant job renovating my kitchen  We went from a boxey dark old kitchen to an open concept bright welcoming and highly functional space  They listened to our needs and created a design that complements our lifestyle  Some of my favorite features include a large 6 sided island with microwave drawer and hidden outlets plenty of work space between the island and the sink stove area and great undercounter lighting   Another highlight was taking down the wall between the kitchen and dining room and putting in a lovely arch which creates definition of the two spaces while giving an open feel to the space  

Bob took us through his process set our expectations and delivered as promised  Robin was fantastic in assisting with final design choices such as lighting tile and even paint colors  We absoutely love our new kitchen and we highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations"
5,I had my kitchen done through KraftMaster Renovations Bob was great to work with and him and his team did an excellent job remodeling my kitchen I was very happy with the work they did and they finished the job the same time they promised I would highly recommend them
4,"Bob and  his team renovated our master bath about a year ago and they did a fantastic job  He is a true professional and worked very closely with us to ensure all of our needs were met and he even anticipated our need before we knew it  He and his team were very respectful throughout the whole process  I would not hesitate to use him again for our renovation needs  He is a class act

5,KraftMaster was an excellent company to work with  All of the employees were top notch  Their attentiontodetail was the best  From the initial meeting to placing the order to all the work that followed all steps were perfectly executed  Our kitchen  family room are the envy of many visitors now thanks to KraftMaster  You wont find a better company to work with
5,"The KraftMaster Team is truly the Dream Team of professionals when it comes to renovations The project started right on time and throughout the process the team kept us abreast of what is next and what to expect 

The craftsmen and designers are top notch With the detail drawings done beautifully and to scale it is easy to envision the end product The KMR team also came up with excellent ideas to maximized the use and functionality of the space The KMR team is very patient and helped us to choose the right materials on multiple shopping trips in perfectly matched colors

We are very happy with the detailed work the overall project and overjoyed with the outcome   We could not thank KMR more for the fabulous service"
5,Kraftmaster did an amazing job creating custom beautiful cabinets for my unique layout and optimized the space The installation was totally pro and whenever small obstacles came up they were all over it and came up with the best solutions I would highly recommend them
5,I hired Bob to completely redo our outdated kitchen His crew was fantastic and trustworthy and they produced beautiful work even providing clever solutions to help us save money We are planning to hire Bob and KraftMaster for future renovations
5,We did a renovation of the whole main floor over the Summer It was a pleasure to work with this company Everything was possible nothing was too much for them It was a large project and it took a while but now that everything is done we are so happy It worked out perfectly Thanks to Bob Robin and Andrew for all the hard work the patience and the optimism
5,"We got lucky in finding Bob We were referred to him from another Professional in our area that left their previous job to go and work with KraftMaster 

We loved the fact that Bob came over to our home to meet with us and be our go to person in our remodel Bob knew all of the construction folks and I felt so secure allowing him into our home 

Bob completely gutted our kitchen and completely opened it up and gave us more room bigger windows and more natural light 

Bob knew that I needed someone to spearhead the project I didnt have enough time to spend all day giving direction I dont know a lot about materials and the like but I knew what I wanted the kitchen to look like He even took me along for the shopping for materials 

I would highly recommend Bob and KraftMaster to anyone seeking a remodel of their home"
5,"Our dream master bathroom became a reality with thanks to the team at KraftMaster  After researching countless hours online and meeting multiple contractors  we found KMR was the perfect fit for us We had lots ideas limited budget and wanted to be an integral part of the renovation process We were seeking a team that would hold our hand every step of the way had impeccable attention to detail provided the necessary thought leadership and had well documented examples of master bathroom transformations which is initially what lead us to their website

Kim was very helpful and patient during the design and redesign process as well as also with our visits to the showrooms and supply houses  Andrii is not only a master at his construction trade he is a true professional that is meticulous friendly and a very hard worker  Each day he would spent extra time for the clean up efforts and educating us on next steps Robby ensured last minute supplies were delivered and was onsite managing all of our inspections in a friendly and personable fashion

Bob and his team all possess the qualities that we rarely find in this business   passionate meticulous friendly neat clean best in class craftsmanship and a trusted partner  Its now been 3 months since our bathroom was transformed and it still feels as though we are visiting a spa Our bathroom came out better than we ever could have imagined Thanks to everyone at KraftMaster Renovations Pete  Betsy"
5,"We are very happy with the end result of our project with Bob and his team  We have an older 1920s home and we knew we were in for a lot of probably unpleasant surprises  Bob was never fazed by anything that came up during the project  Five layers of ceiling demolished on the first day  Needing to replace a toilet in the bathroom upstairs that turned out to be from 1935  A basement full of plumbing in various stages of disintegration  Not only Bob but his entire team were always positive professional and excited with the results of their work  This was our first major renovation project and we are so happy with how it turned out  His designers Robin and Jessica really helped to guide our choices although I will say it is always best to have a good idea of what you want from the beginning  Tony Adam and his entire team were also friendly and professional

Our home has been transformed from a disjointed nightmare prior addition with inlaw suiterental apartment had the only usable kitchen to a floor plan that flows from one end of the ground floor to the other  All of this was accomplished in keeping with the traditional feel of the house and with a reasonable budget considering how much was accomplished  A year ago I couldnt sit in the kitchen and type this review on my laptop and hear the kids if they went to another roomnow all I have to do is lean back and I can see them

We highly recommend Bob and would work with him again"
5,Bob and his team did an amazing job designing our new kitchen  We now have a functional room with plenty of  work space and storage space and it is visually  stunning to boot  From our initial meeting through the design process and the installation Bob Robin and the rest of the team were easy to work with  professional and dedicated working right through Super Storm Sandy to getting the job done right Addtionally the project came in on budget  and there were minimal bumps along the way We couldnt be happier with the end result
5,It is atypical to find a company and owneroperator with the morals ethics standards of excellence creativity and personality that meets or exceeds their representation or quotation Customer service fairness and peace of mind are typically not associated with contractors let alone most companies In Bobs case these are exactly his characteristcs and those of his workers As the father of a handicapped son I required a bathroom remodeling that had to be sophisticated yet practical I required a crew that was professionally responsible and timesensitive to the project Bob is a handson honorable forthright gentleman He is not a yes man in the sense of agreeing to anything and everything just to get a job His input provokes thought and positive results Unlike other contractors who model after magicians and disappear after the contract is signed Bob was at the work site each day  morning afternoon and sometimes evenings His crew works for him and are craftsmen who take pride in their work and showed up on time each day including weekends Bobs contract was professional specific detailed and he did not nicke and dime for specific changes that most other contractors would have done so for they are not interested in building long term relationships and either dont care or understand the value of word of mouth which can either be a businessmans best friend or worst enemy Needless to say the result of the bathroom exceeded my expectations the contract price did not and Bob is a man of his word and worthy of a phone call when you consider a home improvement project I know that I will not hesitate to call him again in the future
5,I hired Bob to renovate design and rebuild my two bathrooms in my home He did a great high quality job He worked with me every step of the way and made me feel very comfortable Even with no planned budget he kept costs to a very reasonable level Bob is a good fit if you are looking for high quality work and can accomodate anyones budget high or low His designers did a great job on everything
5,"Kraftmaster Renovations and Bob Gockeler gave me the kitchen I have been dreaming about for years

 Despite my anal attention to detail and lastminute plan changes he never made me feel I was out of order in my opinions or proposals 

He was just as excited as I was every step of the way and especially with the finished product His crew was clean reliable and trustworthy"
5,"Our 50 year old kitchen needed to be gutted and we were looking for a contractor that did both the design work and construction Once we met with Bob we didnt need to look further as his quiet enthusiasm and love for design and construction customer service and quality was evident throughout our discussion Bob listened well to what we wanted gave us several creative designs was able to easily adjust as the work progressed and we requested changes All throughout he was upfront on costs and options handled the unforeseen behind the wall structural and plumbing surprises the two layers of ceilings the 5 layers of floors and guided us in making the many decisions on the design and materials He never took shortcuts when faced with problems to fix and took the extra time to do the job right

His work crew was on time very polite professional hard working and cleaned up the work area before leaving each night Bob stayed on top of all the issues was always accessible and was patient in guiding us through the process always keeping our vision in mind We couldnt wait to get home each night and see the progress We thoroughly enjoyed working with Bob and his crew and are delighted with the great design attention to detail high quality work and the resulting gorgeous functional kitchen that was beyond our dream Bob provides a high quality customer focused service and we would highly recommend him and his team"
5,"We moved from the city to the suburbs and we knew going in that we wanted to redo the kitchen and open up the living space as soon as spring came around Initially we interviewed a couple architects but all they wanted to do was to mold the house into their vision and not ours Then we found Bob and he immediately knew what we wanted to do with the space and more importantly knew our design aesthetic He came up with a great kitchen design open floor plan and created the perfect space for us Given our budget we had resigned ourselves to semicustom cabinetry but Bob came through again He was able to get us a fully custom kitchen with virtually no change in the budget We gave Bob yet another challenge a time challenge We were expecting our second child and we needed all major construction to be done by time the new baby arrived Bob came through with flying colors All major construction was done ahead of schedule We couldnt have been happier Not only was the work done
in time the quality of the work was top notch and the construction crew are professional and courteous

There are several general contractors we could have gone with but Bob is special He is a great combination of an architect kitchen designer and general contractor He has a great breadth of knowledge when it comes to home construction and we couldnt have chosen better We would definitely use him for any future home improvement projects and would highly recommend him to others

5,"Let me start by simply saying that our Kitchen and other home improvements we had Bob work on are simply Amazing Bob himself is the perfect gentleman and he has built a team of phenomenal people around him so that you always have the right expert on the right job On a number of feature requests we made Bob went above and beyond to discover people as far away as Indiana that could get the job done perfectly He listened to all our detailed requests and made each and every one of them happen Robin his designer is truly amazing and again she personally went above and beyond to ensure every little detail was perfect even giving up substantial time to help us get the right products ordered for a part of the project that was outside her scope Each and every one of the people that worked on the job were incredibly polite and professional  Andrew being a particular star 

Just to keep the review real not everything went completely smooth To be fair we did add significant work to the job but the job did take longer than we expected to complete The difficulty of living in a house that is being renovated is not to be underestimated but no pain  no gain Now that we are comfortably in our new kitchen and home everything was worth it and I cant imagine going through this process without a person like Bob who was available 247 to lead the efforts Bob is so much more than a contractor his full service design  build solution is truly the white glove service the standard which all other service providers should strive to deliver He told us he would never say no  he didnt Now that the project is done he is still readily available to fix any minor issues he is a man that stands over his work 

Let me just finish by saying at his very core Bob is a good man a perfectionist who is proud of the work he and his team does a master of his art"
5,"I had a great experience with Bob I found Bob after searching the web for Professionals near me After meeting with a few different professionals Bob seemed the best for me and my project 

He helped me through the entire process helping me with each step and was great at explaining everything he was going to do he even came shopping for ideas with me I am not originally from the US and Bob was very patient in putting it in terms I would understand and explaining the things while comparing them to the European system for me

This is our first home and our first remodel Bob remodeled our bathrooms from the top down as well as ripped out all of our piping that was very overdue for replacement He treated everything with the best respect in our new home 

I highly recommend Bob to anyone needing a great professional"
1,"Do not use this guy  We paid him 2000 in August 2021 to come out and give us a design  Said would be 2 weeks and would get back to us  Finally in November 2021 he gave us a preliminary design  We discussed some changes and never heard a word back  We have called sent emails and text messages with no responses  

2000 down the drain with nothing to show for it  Very poor service  Do not use him"
5,Mike was great to work with in designing our pool and outdoor living space  We had a vision of what we wanted but Mike was able to really bring it to life  His experience came through in helping us make decisions for a final result that was better than we had imagined
5,We are extremely pleased with Mikes design of our pool and backyard transformation Mike overcame what we thought insurmountable challenges trees slope line of sight and dimension obstacles He created a design that is more beautiful than we imagined and has the recreational features we were dreaming of  Mike has the experience expertise and creativity that you are looking for  We highly recommend Mike Farley
5,"Mike is a great pool designer  We didnt think we could fit everything we wanted in but Mike made it work  We only had to request one design change since his original was so good  Mike discussed indepth the steps that would happen  Our nasty muddy backyard has been transformed into a backyard oasis  We know have a sports pool hot tub basketball hoop and a bbqGreen Egg to cook on 

Mike truly understands how to take a space and make it into a functional living space So glad we hired Mike for the biggest purchase of our lives"
5,Mike was great from start of design to finish  Our pool is a difficult pool due to the grade on our lot but Mike was able to get what we wanted in there and his design is beautiful  He also stepped in when another pool builder pulled out after 16 months of design and permitting  Our pool needs to go in first due to the shape and size of our lot  Mike saved our project
5,Backyard transformation The most critical phase of any project is choosing the right designercontractor to do the job right the first time When I  started the process I contacted three contractors and had them send out their designer It quickly became apparent that the scope and complexity of my project would require a special designer So I started over and I started researching designers not just the contractors as I had done the first time a round After several weeks of research I narrowed it down to two designers Mike Farley was my first call After speaking with Mike over the phone and answering some of his questions I was confident I had found my designer I decided I would wait until we met in person to make my final decision Once I met Mike in person and walked the site of the project I was 100 confident in his ability and knowledge This was a totally different experience than I had with the other three designers I knew I had found my designer and Contractor and we begin the process The process has been seamless from the initial design phase through the revisions and the selection process Mike has been there to answer all my questions and also offer his opinion and expertise which has made this a great experience If youre looking for a  world class designer look no further Mike Farley is your guy
5,We hired Mike to do our backyard design and we were not disappointed We had gone through several designs with different pool companies but were not drawn to any that we saw When we hired Mike he had a unique process of meeting with us first and asking a lot of questions to get to know our vision and figure out our budget first What he came back with blew us away  He is unique in that he listens to what you want and will create just that but add in elements that you may not have thought of For us it was the handing day bed Thanks for a beautiful design Mike   Ginny B
5,Highly recommend Mike for your pool designs  He is very detail oriented and recommendsdesigns your outdoor living area to match your needs and intended use  decking hot tub pool pool type and size equipment  Most importantly Mike was responsive and worked in a timely manner to for designcompletion in order to facilitate timely construction  I greatly appreciate his work as he transformed our backyard to a great outdoor living area  John
5,"Very professional on all fronts 

Claffey Pools plays at the top of the construction game

Mike F is in his craft is true craftsmen  

I would say this was a big decision but in downtown Grapevine I would not have choose anyone else  

This is my 2nd pool I have built with Claffey and honestly i just would not go anywhere else

5,The design of our swimming pool outdoor living area and firepit way exceeded our expectations Mike listened closely to our wants in the very beginning and transformed them into a really beautiful backyard environment Thank You Mike
5,We cant begin to say what a pleasure it is to work with Mike Farley and have him transform our backyard into the paradise that we were looking for  The design process that he uses where he gets to know you and what you are looking for and then turns that into reality is truly amazing  Mike is a master of listening to you and what your desires are understanding your budget and bringing it all together into a remarkable design   He highlighted pros and cons of different aspects features and functionality of the pool so that we could make informed decisions  Mikes process lets you iterate on your designs and to ensure you get the pool of your dreams  Mike was masterful at taking our desires and transforming our blank slate into our resort paradise  We have already recommended Mike to one of our neighbors and would recommend him to anyone

5,From start to finish working with Lou and Budget Exteriors couldnt have been easier My building has been wanting to do siding for awhile but have always been unable to do it because of the price When I talked to Lou he generally made it feel like you knew him for years He got us a great price on siding and the quality is top notch Heres the kicker too from delivery of the dumpster to departure was only 6 business days Workers were unreal one of them was literally on his knees sweeping up the debris from the yard I couldnt be happier with the way this turned out I will definitely use them in the future and will be recommending them to my friends and neighbors Thanks again   Rick M Dorchester MA
5,John and Lou and their crew were responsive and professionalI highly recommend Budget Eteriors for roof replacementGreat job thank you
5,It was a real pleasure to work with the Budget Exteriors team Communication was excellent After talking to John I could see where his approach to the job was going to give me the look and quality I wanted The installation team were all really great folks I couldnt believe how fast the installation went and how great it looks Definitely recommend them
4,I love my windows Angel and Ray were very professional they still came even we had a winter storm the day of install I know Lou tried to get me in his schedule as early as possible but it eventually got done Thank you
5,We had Budget Extreiors install vinyl siding on an apartment building that we own They did a great job I cannot believe the transformation Very happy with the quality of the work It was a large building installation took about a week and a half They will be getting more of my business I heard they also do windows too
5,Working with Lou Gail and team was such a great experience They met our projects expectations and final product was absolutely stunning They replaced old faux brick with new Portsmouth Shakes siding on 2 sections of the house and were very pleased with the outcome and workmanship It was a great decision to choose them the team is honest professional punctual and very clean Everything was done well beyond our satisfaction We hope to have other projects in the near future as we look forward to working with them again Thank you for the A service Undoubtedly a 10 out of 10
5,Budget Exteriors replaced the rubber roof on our 5 car garage and installed a gutter that I requested kind of last minuteall done very much to my satisfaction and timely The only thing we had to wait for was the permit well were talking Boston I especially appreciated their responsiveness throughout the whole thing
5,The whole budget team was great start to finishJohn and Lou maintained solid communication and Angel and Ray faced some rough weather and pushed through to deliver a great and production the end Roof siding and windows all in one shot I wouldnt hesitate to use budget again
5,Budget Exteriors was great to work with They came on time and left the place clean and did nice work for a reasonable price I called them to help me out of a jam when the new window I had order in June was back ordered until December I was halfway through demo expecting the window MUCH sooner and was looking at going into winter with the back of my house half ripped apart   Lou and Angel came framed in the window put on the cedar shingle siding matched up some misaligned basketweave on the corner and competed all the finish work then came back later once the window finally arrived to install it They even put new trim on an adjacent window to match   I would definitely hire them again
5,Our house was in rough shape and needed all the rotten boards replaced under the gutters They completed the job in two days They were professional friendly and left the job spotless We didnt find any issues with the job It was done great I highly recommend them
5,Budget Exteriors did a great job replacing three hopper windows in our basement and two missing pieces of siding from our house Everybody at Budget Exteriors was friendly and easy to work with We would happily work with them again
5,I hired Budget Exteriors to replace 6 basement windows and would definitely hire them again for future projects My job was relatively small for window replacements but John was able to give me a good price and Angel was meticulous with the install Budget Exteriors was great to work with and I would recommend them over any of the national window companies
5,Ive been looking for a contractor to replace siding on a few walls of our house and ended up working with Budget Exteriors after quite a bit of search The initial communication and estimates were seamless done in time we agreed to no delays no reminders The estimate wasnt the lowest I got but still very reasonable and competitive The work crew was good as well everything was done very quickly and looked good along the way We encountered a little unexpected problem during the installation which they addressed quickly and without any questions  All in all very satisfied and would not hesitate to work with them again
5,I had contacted another roofing company in May about doing my roof  they told me that I was on there list to be done I waited three months calling several times to be told Your on the list In August I called Budget and within 48 hours had an estimate and within 3 weeks had a new roof The crew came out on the hottest day in August and put on a new roof in one day They were professional and cleaned up exceptionally well Very pleased with this company and would definitely have them do more work for when needed Moira Toscano Roslindale MA
5,Was on time very responsive and when they left there was not a leaf to be found in the yard Some of my neighbors have even asked who I had because it was so clean
1,The individual showed up late without informing me or apologizing Upon reviewing the job he continued to tell me he couldnt do what I was asking but didnt offer a reasonable solution He sent me a couple of texts two days later telling me I shouldnt proceed as planned again with no solution I never received an estimate Terrible
1,They forgot to complete a portion of my roof per my contract I was told that they would come back and complete it since their workers made the mistake It has been 5 months I was told its an hour job and I had to wait my turn When they charged me 10k they were here within a week Unprofessional and I will be reaching out to a lawyer
1,We signed a contract for siding replacement in May 2021 and received no follow up or timeline for the job for six months The excuse was that the city hadnt issued a permit Hundreds of houses in our neighborhood receive permits within days and other contractors informed us this is a nonissue and work can be started as long as the permit application is processed Budget kept us waiting for six months and the only contact was with the estimator sent inappropriate emails with extremely unprofessional behavior Our siding deteriorated and our house is leaking from storms so we are left with no choice but to find a competent contractor who can do this job quickly Budget has yet to return our deposit after the six month wait
5,John was amazing honest organized and helpful at explaining roofing basic and important info giving me a free quote I loved how flexible they were with rescheduling Unfortunately wasnt able to move forward with their service because there was a lot to do on my roof and it was pricey for us at the moment
5,Budget exterior did a great job we have new insulated windows which means less noise from the neighborhood They were responsive and gave us a reasonable price will call them for the rest of the windows soon
5,We hired Budget exteriors to complete our home siding project From start to finish their team was phenomenal We received 5 quotes and Budget Exteriors beat all of their competition in both quality and price Their team came within the planned time frame and communication was great They restored our 120 year home with detached garage with such great care I would highly recommend Budget Exteriors to anyone looking for a quality home siding professional
5,Lou replaced the fibercement siding on my house I am very happy with the work he did The siding looks very neat The project was completed in a timely manner The communication was great Lou was very responsive to my emails and calls and he was very clear explaining the process and setting expectations
5,I needed my roof shoveled fro the impending blizzard and Louis had a crew out there the afternoon I called him Good and quick work
5,I had consultations with a number of contractors before selecting Budget Exteriors Lou was very professional responded to emails and phone calls within 24 hrs and gave me a number of references I went onsite to one of his references to verify that the job was done well  Lou came in with the lowest estimate even accounting for the cost of the siding proposed by various contractors Even though the project took longer than estimated an old warped house is difficult to side properly the job was done well and neighbors have stopped by to praise the work Also Lou does not nickel and dime his word is reliable Of course do get everything in writing before starting the project  I believe Lou does not directly employ the 35 crews that work for him they are subcontracted Thats the only thing I didnt know at the outset They did a great job though Your results may vary with the crew you get
5,I was extremely satisfied with the quality of the work as well as the pricer the overall job
5,they were there the next day for an estimate
3,Happy with the window installation but they could do much better on customer service and responsiveness
5,Amazing price great work easy process  looks fabulous
5,Miscommunication these guys are great
5,Windows look great job was completed thoroughly and Id use them again for my other windows
5,Roof looks great and they got it done promptly Were very responsive and accommodating
5,The job was done quickly and professionally I would highly recomend Budget Exteriors for you renovations
5,Thank you
5,Always in time great clean up daily Vey responsive
1,When I called the company they said they could replace my windows with Harvey windows So I made an appointment for them to come out and give me a price The gentleman surveyed my windows and told me he could get Harveys windows in 4 to 6 weeks While talking I mention I replaced one of the windows in my house myself He asked why I wasnt replacing the 2 windows I asked them to replace He said he would get a price to me asap One week later I left multiple messages for them to get back with a quote They finally called and said they couldnt find the price of harvey windows but he would definitely get back to me in a couple days 2 weeks later still no quote They wasted my time
4,They did a satisfactory job 
5,Very responsive
1,Told Mikes salesman Im in hurry to get this job done within the next two weeks because Ive had too many guys waste my time Little did I know they were going to do the same  Called his salesman and pushed for the quote because I didnt get it when promised Got the quote and never heard back from them 11 days later Mike is giving me grief telling me its MY fault for not chasing after them I have other companies diligently contacting me for my business I shouldnt have to chase after anyone to give them my money  With everything I have going on I have to push them to do their job They have one job to do and thats work with the customers that they find If they cant even do that how can I expect them to take care of me after the sale  He told me that he normally doesnt hear from people for 6 months Ridiculous Again I mentioned that I told his salesman I needed this done by the end of the month and even expressed a sense of urgency with getting the quote and asked if I gave them the job how soon would they be able to do it His salesman said by the third week of June  Mike vented to me the customer in a way he shouldnt What ever happened to the customer is always right How he sees himself and his company as being polished is beyond me Making excuses for dragging their feet is bad behavior for any business owner especially when the customer is telling them you need this done soon I dont like the blameless attitude he has and the way he points the blame on the customer When I was in sales and management in IT and finances the correct thing to do was always follow up after a quote within 24hrs Especially when the customer is making it clear that theres a sense of urgency Not only has Budget exterior shown me they have a lackadaisical attitude but Mike convinced me that they didnt care about messing up my busy calendar with their procrastination They were going to get back to me when it was convenient for them And now hes raising his voice at me because he doesnt to admit hes wrong   Last night I got fed up with the way we were going back and forth and I had to tell him the truth that they wasted my time Calling me up today to raise your voice at the customer is very very wrong I questioned his professionalism weeks ago when I spoke with him He seemed rather abrupt  rude He called and left me a voice message later apologizing for the way he spoke to me because of his 3 dogs barking when there was someone at the door Thats not an excuse for not being unprofessional I figured Id give him another chance since he apologized But now after the call he made to me he convinced me I wasnt dealing with someone I can trust to do business with   I Really hate it when people act nice just to get your business but when they realize they lost it they stop the pretense and show you what theyre really like Mike did not try to understand my point of view He was being very argumentative and hard to communicate with He has an unbelievable bad temper He just wanted to call me and act like a tough guy to give me a hard time and what was important to him was that he get the message across that they are right and I am wrong I didnt appreciate how he spoke to me and would never do business with them
1,I set an appointment for an estimate The owner didnt show up and he never called I called him left a message and got no response I called four hours later and was sent to voice mail Have the work done before giving him the money 
1,I set up a date and time for them to come and give me a quote after talking to them on the phone I followed up the day before and they said theyd be there Unfortunately no one showed up I even called and left a voicemail and a message on here No reply or explanation whatsoever Very disappointed

5,Super quick to respond and make availability to meet our requests
1,Where do I begin  Always Always READ THE REVIEWS FIRST BEFORE PICKING SOMEONE If I had done that I wouldnt have picked JOE SAVINO Also read his responses to negative reviews It shows a lot about his professionalism and creditability  Issue 1  He didnt take notes of the conversation as we went through the unit He took days to send over the invoice and missed a few things He gave an invoice that wasnt itemized even  Issue 1A  Upon a second visit and came with his young daughter At the time I didnt think much of it but after thought it was a scam to lower a person guard and come off as a wholesome contractor depicting a loving fatherdaughter bonding moment   Issue 2  He did not order any items which for a GC they typically get a discount on items that most consumer do not get So I could then reimburse him I found this odd that he would want me the client to order I understand that lights and small items the client can purchase but big tickets items like a kitchen package with a GC discount would save me tons of money  Issue 2A  The appliances were delayed by a week due to a scheduling mishap on the delivery company and JOE SAVINO wanted to upcharge me  Issue 2B  Even with the delay Joe Savino told me he would be the
5,Savino come on time did the project with complete professionalism I would use him again and refer him to others
5,Great guy Trustworthy and does a solid job I would use him again
2,Hired to fix some outlets Came over an hour late Took a look at them and basically said he couldnt fix them Charged me 200 for a consultation and only fixed 1 out of 3 of them Not great service or attitude
5,Great work thanks Joe
5,Very good ac replacement for one put into a wall
2,I may have missed it but I assumed I was paying 45 an hour I did not realize there was a minimum 3 hours This must have been in the fine print There were 2 things that needed to be done one which was completed took 10 minutes and I was charged 156 the other he could not perform offered to come back on Tuesday never heard from him but as he was going to charge me another 156 not particularly worried In summary I paid 156 FOR HALF A JOB that took 10 minutes
5,We had Savino install our bath faucet and kitchen faucet along with our garbage disposal job was well done and we will call them back for sure for any other future projects
5,Fantastic crew outstanding work will definitely use again installed lighting and fans make sure to call you will not be disappointed Joe was awesome
3,My gas boiler wasnt working properly When I asked Joe about the license he said he has the license to work on Gas boilers I think hes very pricey
5,Highly recommended Saved money and did an excellent job 
5,Was well prepared Finish the job fast and perfectly Would hire again
5,Had a nice experience when we had an issue with our heating and hot water Would hire again

5,Wonderful to work with willing to explain what was needed and responsive Will definitely use in the future
5,He did an excellent job
5,Installed my garage disposal Happy with the results Would use them again
3,I needed a garbage disposal installed where there was none and needed an electric connection run from the board to the garbage disposal I received several quotes for this described job one of them was Savino I was going to provide the garbage disposal There was misunderstanding on who was to provide plumbing supplies They may be nominal costs But the quote to perform the job went up from 175 to 500 at which point I felt to reevaluate and shop around I didnt hire Savino for the job They were friendly responsive and punctual I just couldnt get past the price change
5,Replaced faucet and supply lines Punctual and professional
5,Joe was very friendly professional knowledgeable and easy to work with Would hire again
5,Brad and Joe were rockstars Needed a bunch of things assembled and they took the stress off my shoulders
5,These guys did a great job on some minor repairs and plumbing Prompt and easy to deal with
5,I would highly recommend this company They did an excellent job and I am very pleased with the outcome
5,Joe and his crew did an outstanding job for us mounting and wiring multiple monitors as well as construction of our offices we recommend the highly you will like the crew and quality workmanship
2,UPDATE 2172021 I had great luck with Joe on my first project and hired him again to do a number of projects around my house I still think that the work done was excellent but the lack of communication with the second project was disappointing The work was not done in a timely manner and at this point work that was to be completed on my laundry room is still not finished I have not heard from Joe in over 3 months and am sadly not satisfied with the lack of communication and incomplete job  ORIGINAL REVIEW I appreciated Joes communication with me throughout the project and his honesty about the possible cost depending on the extent of the damage inside my exterior wall The team was very professional and the job was well done
3,The wiring was abnormal but they were able to make sense of it and complete the job
5,They were right on time and fixed issues quickly

5,Couldnt ask for anything better
1,Joe came to give me a quote to replace a kitchen fan and a bathroom fan When his quote came in it was astronomical at 14000 I had the bathroom fan replaced yesterday by a different company and it cost 500 including the fan
1,Scheduled time to complete project and coordinated key pickup Joe didnt follow any instructions didnt pickup key and stopped by project when couldnt be worked on After further talk realized not much skills or lack of experience Would not higher again grateful they didnt do the work what they were going to do would have caused a lot of damage

5,Very honest
1,Very unprofessional I had Michael install an outdoor light fixture A very easy job I probably could have completed on my own but did not have the time to get it done He gave me an estimate of 250 to complete the job which was a little high but he was able to come out quickly so I agreed   He came to my condo to diagnose the issue with my light but arrived late He determined the light fixture needed to be replaced but wouldnt be able to complete the job until I went and purchased a new light fixture He asked that I pay the 250 at this time and 25 dollars for gas for him to return and replace the fixture He also said he did not have any caulking for the job and said I would need to go buy some I figured expenses such as gas and supplies like caulking would be included in the estimated price but I reluctantly agreed just so I could get the job done at this point   After purchasing the fixture and caulking I scheduled a day for him to come complete the job We scheduled for 3pm About 30 min past the scheduled date and time I still had not heard from Michael I texted him and asked if he still planned on coming He responded and said that he was at another job in Maine and would not be able to come for about another 4 hours which was not going to work with my schedule We rescheduled for him to come the following day   Michael was scheduled to arrive at my condo at 7am but was late again arriving more than an hour late After completing the job Michael texted me and stated that he could not caulk in the fixture because he had left his caulk gun at another job Michael did not indicate that he planned on returning to caulk it in and suggested that I do it myself After inspecting the work Michael completed the light did not appear to be level and the fixture itself was loose from the wall  I would not recommend hiring Michael unless you want to overpay be nickel and dimed for things like gas and materials which should be included in the quoted price and have to deal with an unprofessional individual At the very least he got the light working with the new fixture  Michael identifies himself as an Army veteran in his profile I am a veteran myself and this is one of the reasons I trusted hiring him However this is not the way a veteran should conduct themselves when doing business

3,I stupidly removed my oven door and then couldnt put it back on It took 15 minutes to fix my oven I was quoted 180 but when he got there the price was changed to 199 which I didnt appreciate but I was stuck so I went ahead Then when he handed me the screen to sign there were several options for a tip I was flustered and gave a 10 tip but was angry with myself for feeling obliged to tip him since the price was already more than quoted and he was the owner of the business Since when do you have to tip an
5,Was very knowledgeable and explained how things worked and spent the time needed to fix the issue and test it to make sure before leaving Took longer than expected and he didnt try to leave before making sure was fixed
4,Fast Tech was professional and apologetic that our 80 evaluation became a 220 bill because while evaluating the issue he found a screw where the lining of the dryer door meets the drum I feel bad for him because he clearly expected an argument but having experience with dispatching service techs I knew what to expect Frankly he showed up in 3 hours notice on a Saturday including at least an hour of driving each way I was fine with 220 for his time
5,I am really impressed with the troubleshooting efforts He not only looked at dishwasher but also cleaned entire piping system to find the obstruction which is stopping the draining
5,They were super fast to respond and set appointment We had to cancel at the last minute and they were super understanding I was worried about their response but they were great We will 100 use them again
5,No issues at all Easy to schedule punctual great attitude The job was fast as well George is a great professional
5,The technician Ivan was great and did the job of replacing the control pad on my dishwasher quickly and efficiently My only constructive criticism about this company would be to pay a little more attention to communication Communications only ever really happened when I initiated them  as a customer it is always reassuring to get updates from a company especially when you are trying to juggle work etc about expectations of time whether a part has arrived etc  a little in advance of scheduling an appointment Once the communications were initiated by me everything went smoothly Dishwasher fixed I am happy with Ivans work so 5 stars
5,Arrived next day fixed the washer quickly Works great again
5,I thought the labor cost was too pricy especially since I provided the replacement parts and the work did not even take 20 min to complete

4,Fixed my parents dryer and stove range and did a good job Thought it would be a bit of a lower rate but its fixed now so thats good Communication was pretty good

5,Very quick with response came on time and finished job at reasonable rate
5,Ivan was great to explain the
1,500 per hour is a pretty heft rate The guy was here for less than 60 minutes did a check of both washer and dryer found nothing wrong and charged me 500 Whew A long way away from the 69 they use in advertising Sneaky Be careful
1,Really bad experience with this provider Got rescheduled 3 times had to call them all the time to ask if anybody would show up Was treated as if customer was not important and no value for peoples time I would run away from this provider

5,Excellent prompt and got the job done
2,While they were a quick response and fixed the issue I felt I was extremely over billed for service 200 for less than a half an hour is on the high side for a service call

1,I requested service on my dishwasher for a loud motor type noise and excessive water flowing from the air gap fixture  The tech was late however I did get phone calls to update estimated arrival The tech broke a piece on the front of my dishwasher and I had to point it out and tell him he needed to fix it He told me the loud noise coming from my dishwasher was typical of my dishwasher brand but then miraculously it had something to do with the heated dry so he turned that feature off but no answer as to why that was happening or how to

5,Very pleased with the work done by Alex Very careful and committed to taking care of the problem Also personable seemed completely trustworthy I recommend him highly
5,The companies response time via the app is quick They provided multiple time options for same day as well as for different days I chose same day 112 however I received a call at 130 informing me they will need to come between 25 As I am working from home this was fine Alex arrived around 400pm and immediately got to work He was able to fix our issue as well as informing us of a pulley in the dryer that didnt spin properly and informed us of the issue it would cause He also went above and beyond to help hook the vent system back up which I had issues with trying to do myself
5,Alex was very quick with his diagnosis  estimate
5,He replaced the ice maker and it did not solve the problem He checked the water supply valve and said I could get a new one for 20000 and it still may not solve the problem It might be electrical Ive already spent 35000 and my icemaker in my freezer still works so I just will use that until I make a decision on what to do next
5,Evan a young man was very knowledgeable and professional Seemed a bit shy and could speak a bit louder and more distinctly for us 75 yearolds But I was pleased with the overall result Would use him again
4,The refrigerator had a leak in the coils and would have been too expensive to fix so just did the service call
5,I had a water filter stuck in my fridgeit was removed and replaced in a very short time My dish washer had a part fall off it was replaced the next day No muss no fuss Great job
5,Excellent service and kind
3,It was pretty pricey 500 to replace a board in my fridge probably 30 minutes labor between the diagnosis and the install  The board was only about 100  Was told
4,unfortunately punctuality was not there  wished they had contacted me to inform me of delay waited 3hrs before I found out   Technician was very informative and efficient and did call re delay the second scheduled visit
3,I did not like the tech trying to upsell all the way to replacing the entire compressor even before diagnosis to which I had to tell him I am sure compressor is fine I just need vacuuming which I do not have the time and tools for BTW I am a mechanical engineer which I did not tell him From stepping into my house to handing me an invoice of 275 he was barely here for a max of 30 mins When I asked him why this is so expensive his answer well you have a subzero like a ferrari in your garage Ill never use you guys againI am not worried about how much I spent I just cant trust a salesman fixing my
4,The workman was very nice on time and professional The only thing he didnt do is something I forgot to tell him about Not a problem
5,They came out when they said they would showed up when they said they would completed the work like they said they would and did it same day Just night and day service compared to another company I hired previously Would definitely use again
4,We were pleased at the quick response and timely appointment

5,Was expensive and could not do the
4,They responded quickly and came out promptly He told me what was wrong with my washer and gave me a quote to fix it I ended up finding the part and fixing it myself though as it was not very difficult
5,Came with necessary replacement parts and took the time to ensure proper performance of our dryer by making systematic adjustments
5,Diagosed the issue with my down draft oven and gave me an estimated to fix it He clearly knew what he was doing Very impressed
5,Alex came and was able to fix our ice maker so that we didnt need to replace the entire motor and spend 23x as much  he thought outside the box and got our ice maker functioning
5,Very nice very prompt He actually called one day early showed up diagnosed the problem ordered a part and was back the next day
5,Great tech New what the problem was right away by phone Showed up the next day for the
5,Excellent job Response was very timely and
5,Exelent
5,Good responsive and professional fix Felt a tad bit expensive for just a drain pump clog fix but issue was resolved in no time

5,The team provided great communication provided a weekend service visit and promptly fixed our washing machine Than you

5,Great He was punctual and explained the issue in detail He said in case the issue comes up again he will fix it for free Great service overall
5,Adam was great very professional He had to leave for a couple of hours to get the part for my dryer He came back fixed it efficiently and also he showed me how to clean out my washing machine which was an added plus
5,Courteous careful service They made my dishwasher look and operate like new Fast and professional And the price was fair I would definitely recommend them
4,Still waiting to hear for available parts to
3,The gentleman that came out was very nice and knowledgeable but the price was very high Needed a cooling fan that I found in several places online for around 15000 but was charged over 45000 for the part Was told they source locally and it is usually higher than online understandable but 300 higher is beyond ridiculous The oven is however working again so that is good I will most likely price ship next time I need service on something
5,Thanks guys for the quick appointment and for
5,Very quick and honest diagnosis
3,Arrivedalmost on time Promptly told me that there was nothing he could do for my refrigerator and it was working perfect Paid 75 and got zero information on how I might go about resolving the noise issue coming from my fridge It would have been helpful if the tech maybe treated us like customers and not just a money dispensary impersonal and effectively useless service Probably better with broken
4,The gentleman that came was very nice I was having trouble with odor and sounded like water was still in in the drum on my washing machine When he got there he said it was normal and couldnt do anything about it so I was very disappointed in that aspect of it Still having the order so Im not sure what to do next Very disappointing when you still have to pay the 75 fee for them to come out but that is anybody And understand that
4,They were great A little expensive but you pay for fast service Highly recommend them
3,Came out three times in order to
5,No
3,George was a nice man and the work is done but there were 3 things I didnt like about this experience 1 When he showed up for the first time he came in and walked right by me to the kitchen no hand shake or introduction or business card 2 His first verbal quote of the cost was 790 and when we didnt like that and said wed buy a new
5,There was some miscommunication but work itself was done in timely manner
5,Great experience Would definitely hire this company again
4,Didnt have 100 confidence that the problem was diagnosed correctly Also didnt clean up after themselves as well as they couldve Next time probably wouldve tried to find someone more experienced
5,Seemed to work great
5,Very helpful and good work
4,Initially received communications quickly but day of the appointment I didnt receive a call for confirmation or any message via TT   Reached out a few times on TT and no response   The tech showed up during the 4 hour window Although a call or text would have been appreciated to plan accordingly
4,Everything went great the only thing to complain about is the cost 180 for 30 minutes I partially fixed the problem before the technician came itd be great if they can provide flexible pricing
4,They did the job but it seemed expensive and they were quite late to the appointment Id still use them again I think
3,Happy with work However the price was outlandish

4,Good service
5,They were prompt and went right to work seemed to know there business
3,The appointment was scheduled for the next day The technician called before the scheduled time to say he would be about a hour late
2,The technician told that some glass was stuck in drain pipes causing the grinding noise Vaccum pump was used to remove the particles but it did not fix the issue and inturn broke the drain The technician left saying he dont know what happened called back and told a part has to be reinstalled that would cost 350 I rejected and asked to fix it to original condition because I only had grinding noise and everything was working fine before

5,Very prompt and professional Especially very honest about pricing
3,Technician found nothing wrong with
5,Technician did a great job
2,Charge a fee to come out and use it as leverage to over charge for
2,Their customer service was terrible I was kept waiting three different times for hours beyond what i was told Though the
5,Great team upfront cost and quick turn around
1,Said we needed a 700
2,He did a decent job but we got taken to the cleaners ending up paying almost 800 with a triple markup on a grey market replacement part not OEM by Viking  I suppose having a Viking range that was in the house we purchased marks us as rich suckered And when we asked for the model of the part or range he refused to tell us for fear wed do a price check Unfortunately we were in a pinch and needed the work done asap  I wouldnt recommend this outfit And thats very rare for me as I always give top reviews
4,I can recommend Pro
1,Getting charged 100 to be told just to buy a new
5,It was a quick consultation and no
4,They responded very quickly ultimately for me it made more sense to purchase a new machine
5,Quick response and completion of
5,Good job
5,Very good experients with this company  My Oven was fixend the same day
5,They did a great job
1,Advertisement was not accurate Ut cost me 180 for 15 minutes of work Did not mention senior discount This was after they canceled our first appointment  Will not use this company again
1,Not experts in GE Washing Machine Recommended to replace Mother board while the problem was with Sensor
1,Very unsatisfactory On the first visit technician said he couldnt find anything wrong On 2nd visit a week later he said the same thing even after I had explained the situation He didnt check anything but the freezer temp I called a 3rd time and he guessed what the problem could be and quoted a hefty fee Mind you this was a guess I dont recommend them Too bad I paid the 100 consultation fee
1,This company is a scamdo not use They are dishonest and dont know what they are doing
2,Fixed the problem Price was 49 an hour Did a bait and switch and pricing ended up charging 180 and hour Fixed the problem in 15 minutes and still charged 180
4,The follow up was professional
1,The person never got back to me with any information after we connected Totally weird
5,The man knew the problem right away
1,I requested help with a specific brand of
5,Knew exactly whattheproblem was
1,First the Pros waited till almost the end of my window to tell me they needed to come later or reschedule and we had the latest window to start with The service person showed and then told me the part needed to fix my washer was no longer available this was not true and was available from multiple sources I called and when I told the office this information I was told a manager would have to call me back Instead I received a text telling me they agreed the part was available but only wanted to use an aftermarket parts distributer who wanted to charge 130 more than the actual manufacturer for the needed part citing they could not warranty the part if it came from the manufacturer and not their parts person You cannot call with an issue because the manager who was able to immediately text me would not be available for several hours and in fact never did call me back These guys are horrible and did not even attempt to work with me other than to say there was nothing they could do
1,He didnt take the Washing machine apart He just guessed what could be wrong just talking to my husband After he left we took it apart and found the springs  what he said to replace all in tact He also said he didnt know if it would fix the problem Terrible service
1,next time send a pro The problem was not what he said
1,My VMOS200SS Microwave Oven Control Board Unit was replaced by Pro
5,Professional
5,Good response
1,First of all charge the amount you quote and then fix the problem to customers satisfaction This tech insisted the problem was fixed and it was actually worse after he did the work So 490 later still a washer that doesnt work He told my husband it works fine and he wasnt coming back Total rip off
5,Excellent person
4,Will complete once the job is done

1,Started out great techowner Eesa came out as planned took apart  assessed the refrigerator explained the problem well I received a quote though it took longer than expected and had some questions They answered one of them corrected sales tax then I asked whether there were any discounts on parts and whether parts are covered by manufacturers warranty The answers were no and were checking with the parts dept should hear the answer to this no later than 12p today I didnt hear back Over the next couple of days I sent emails texts and thumbtack messages to them and left a couple of voice mails I NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN Extremely unprofessional not to mention a waste of my time and money
5,He was very helpful and knowledgeable I would definitely go through Thumbtack again
2,Servicemen are professional and very pleasant However they are not reliable with times Additionally they charge a lot of money just to come out and evaluate the problem which is not applied to a service fee This amount differs each visit and the discount for repeat customers has actually been more than the quoted amount from this site Further after one
5,Thanks for fixing our laundry machine
5,The company was very professional and I am happy with their work
4,Making an appointment is a bit complicated but the work quality is above average
5,From beginning to end Easa was very professional and knowledgeable
5,Arrived on time was knowledgable and explained the problem Fast service
2,The actual servicing of our washer was great The gentleman
1,They came out over a week ago and I paid them 125 plus to tell me what was wrong  Tech told me they would get back to me in2448 hours  Still waiting I wouldnt use them
5,According to my tenants feedback they did amazing job
5,TOTLE was professional prompt clear about my options and fixed my washer Thanks
5,Came for a service call to figure out what was wrong great friendly service Will use again
2,The man who serviced our refrigerator did fine except he didnt tighten a panel correctly and it began to rattle as soon as he left and continues to rattle When I called the girl told me she would need to charge my credit card again and would refund if it was the repairman fault Its a shame because I liked the service man but do outlying that I would use them again Im now getting used to the rattle and sometimes when I hear it I think of the mistake I made using these short thinking people SAD

1,I set up an appointment 3 days ahead of time for a technician to come to my home anytime from 812 At 1140 I called and sent an email regarding what time will the technician be arriving Nobody texted back I finally called the customer service number and the technician answered and states that he will be 23 hours late This is my issue If you knew that you would be running late to service a clients call them to let them know AHEAD of time I say this because I could of made arrangements for someone to be there until the technician got at my home Secondly my husband took a half of day from running his own business to be available This was sooooo unprofessional and inconsiderate I will NEVER use or recommend there service to anyone

5,Miguel was referred to me by a friend to check on my leaky dishwashers He quickly found out the problems  fixed it   We were going through some difficulty with some unfinished renovationupdate  my husband let Miguel checked out our work Miguel quoted us a deal  i can tell hes trying to help out   He started a week later as promised with his son daily to work on them They listened to our concern  worked together solving many issues often beyond our expectations eg he made our closet doors  shower door working better  looking better He hung our shower panel a lot more secure than the youtube video that i watched His son is also a very professional electrician plumber  a creative problem solver He worked efficiently  with care he paid attention to protect our bath fixtures eg hed get drop cloth  papers to protect our bath tub b4 he drilled  installed any fixture without me even asking They also gave great advice on how to put things towel bar toilet paper holder to make the space function better  more beautiful The best part was they were so pleasant joyful polite  encouraging I never imagined the work could be finished within 5 days but they worked hard to make it a reality Honestly i was at my worst myself but they were like angels helping us through They have the best work ethics  are among those ppl like my painter  my retired plumber who worked with me 7 yrs that i would give an extra star if there is an option to give them 6 stars

5,He was honest what he can d6 and wiat he Cannot do he help alot and i recomend him to ayone who needs a handy man
2,I thought we were on the same page He was kind when we met  However I felt I was being taken advantage with the cost of labor he was trying to charge me  He asked me to get the material because his price for the material and labor was over my budget  He told me he would charge me 40000 I express that was extremely high  I was able to find the material he needed to just board up my garage for 20400 So 40000 labor is double of what the material cost  He said since I thought his labor was too much he didnt want to work with anymore which I thought was immature He didnt try to negotiate another price As a consumer I have the right to express my feelings on pricing  If he doesnt understand this then maybe he should not be in this business
5,Front yard needed a redo so I contacted Torres landscaping to put new sod down and

1,Reached out for an estimate and passed messages back and forth for several days Agreed that he would come out to inspect and give an estimate Even confirmed when I would be available After all of this wasted time he asked me to send pictures so he wouldnt waste his gas on the estimate Pictures could have been requested right away Very unprofessional
1,Torres landscaping was the worst experience Ive ever had with a contractor To simply explain here are the pictures of our landscape in less than a month No one spends thousands of dollars for a temporary 1 week fix expected it to last much longer a lot longer Was told by Torres after 2 weeks that this simply needs maintenance At the end of the day we ended up reaching an agreement i was satisfied with However soon after he started sending very very unprofessional text messages All I can say is Buyer Beware
1,Couldnt even get through a discussion on the job They asked if I was a cheap person or if I like to spend money on designer things And was never able to get a quote or information on the installation process They are rude condescending and evasive
1,Unreliable company people We hired them paid a date hold fee and signed contract well in advance of the work date When the work date was coming close I sent them courtesy messages to confirm and double confirm  which I think typically the business sends but they kept saying they are checking on their end And never showed up to do the work and never responded to our many messages They did refund our deposit But now we are left with our work not being done as at this peak season time its hard to find someone   If you value your time please dont hire them
4,They have the ability to handle basic yard work as well as a complete landscaping over haul and they have
5,Erick was great to work with Very patient with all my questions and delivered 100 on the project
5,The work that Erik did was exceptional He worked diligently to get the job done
5,Showed up to give a quote within 2 hours of requesting one Completed the services the next day Very efficient team
5,Pleasant crew Fast response great value and fantastic job
5,Came when promised performed as promised Cleaned up after and left everything as I requested
4,Quick response and good work for a good price Would have appreciated if theyd been wearing masks for my interactions with them but ultimately it was all outdoors
1,I personally have not had a good experience with this company that I hired for Christmas lights installation To begin I made an appointment for an estimate and since they were running late and could not make it I sent a picture They replied with markings on where the lights would be I agreed and scheduled When the crew arrived they installed the lights but missed a part of the roof stating that it was too steep to install the lights there When I showed the crew the markings they went ahead and installed them The light chords were just hanging instead of being neatly tucked in so you would not see them from the street They stated that is why they use thin cables I have since driven around areas to see other lights and even my own neighbor few doors down did not have any cables showing Couple of weeks before Christmas the lights fell down had to reach out for them to come out and reinstall To their credit they did come the following day The lights fell down again few days ago which shattered on my porch and left glass on the ground had to reach out to them again At that point since it was after Christmas I asked for them to be removed They showed up and with a pole they removed lights and clips but left three on the roof and left Have sent them two messages asking why they left three clips on the roof when they should have removed all of them They did not bother to reply  All in all the lights did not look very good as some did not even point in the same direction and the cables were hanging Definitely not as neat as i have seen elsewhere in other homes It was a sloppy half job that I paid way too much for Now I also have to pay someone to remove the remaining clips I most certainly would not recommend Torres Landscaping for lights install
5,Eric came out and got the job done quick and it looks very nice

2,Extremely disappointed in Torres and their customer service Erick replaced our sod and some dead shrubs back at the end of March He noted on his quote that there was a 90day guarantee on the sod and that he would remain in contact with us during this time I sent him pictures of dead sod a month ago that needed to be replaced he responded that he would check it out after my second attempt of reaching him however I havent heard back from him for the last two weeks Will consider changing this rating if he decides to contact me back and replace the dead sod
4,Erick did a great job on my flowerbed looking forward to future projects

3,I offered them a project remotely I think they did the workI am still not sure but the communication was lacking So I am still not sure how the place the looked like before or after They sent me lowres videos via text messaging when I asked them for pictures text messaging compresses videos They took the project based on a highres picture of a shrub but implied that I misled them about the scope since shrub had three stems so it was 3 shrubs like I should have counted the stems I paid them in full but I would not work with them again They are probably hardworking people but they are not professionals

5,They came through at our time we need last minute work They did a great job and considering them if I decide to hire weekly Thank you so much
5,These guys are amazing We bought a house last year with a very neglected 13 acre lawn and decided to tear out and replace the entire thing this spring I received several quotes and theirs was very reasonable for the amount of work needed Alex was super friendly and knowledgeable and on the day of the project Juan and his team showed up on time and got right to work   Between the three of them they were able to completely tear out and replace an entire 13 acre lawn in TWO DAYS This included scraping the existing grass and weeds tilling adding topsoil laying and rolling sod and rebuilding some flagstone paths that had been worn down into the dirt over the years They even went above and beyond and tilled a few areas of unplanted flower beds that I had marked off in the back yard and evened out the rock flower bed borders making them look way better than I had been able to do on my own Everyone involved in this project was extremely nice and hardworking and my new lawn looks so good that Ive already had neighbors ask me for their card   I will absolutely call these guys again the next time I need any kind of landscape service and have already recommended them to neighbors

4,This review is for install of a French Drain Job completed Its been about one month now I guess it works as it has not rained much in my area If you do not speak Spanish the communication between Alex female English speaker and Juan is mediocre at best I told Alex exactly what I was wanting and Juan had to start over on one section due to lack of communication As well I dont have a good feeling that he graded the drain appropriately No screens were placed over the collectors to prevent mosquitoes Had to do it myself However they did complete the job in one days time They did allow me to make payments That is the reason for the 4th star For this particular type of job next time Ill look elsewhere

5,Faris responded quickly and asked for details and came prepared I wanted the French cleats for my mirrors installed a little out of the ordinary and Faris made sure he understood before starting the project I had started putting together a modular cart while Faris was hanging my 4 mirrors Faris finished in an hour and a half Im still not done Haha He communicated his delay within a reasonable timeframe Will definitely contact Faris again

1,He had amazing reviews so not sure why we had a disconnect As soon as I answered the door he was not friendly I explained that I needed a couple of shelving units anchored to the wall but that I had previous issues with the sheetrock not holding heavy items I asked if he was going to locate a stud and he said no would use anchors That was the issue I had when I did it myself Sure enoughanchor would not stay in place I stopped the work and gave him 40 and told him we were finished Alsoevery time I spoke to him he looked at me like I did not know what I was talking about kind of dismissive toward me I considered that we might have a language barrier but could tell by his responses and his English was very good I can hang things myself by the hunt and peck methodmake my own holesdo not need help with that He did offer to patch his hole and I said no thanks

1,This is a revised review  I had given high stars to the service I got the service done in late 20201Within few weeks of the service my TV mount started to droop I reached out to Faris to which he said when he comes around my area he will take a look and fix and gave me some tips to fix the TV mount After multiple failed attempts i have been waiting since September of 2021 The story is still the same from this installer and now hes saying i gave you tips on what to do customer fix their own issues themselves Which I think is the worst thing to say I guess not all apples are shaped equally a true professional otherwise would go out of hisher way to satisfy the customer needs But not this one lesson learned not hiring again

5,This review or for mounting and installation I talked to Ben about four possible tasks that I needed done 2 motion sensor solar panel light mounting 1 door reinforcer installation and 1 cabinet hinge repair Initially I asked if all four projects could be done in an hour However after our discussion it sounded like it would take more than an hour so I I asked Ben to prioritize the lights first to see how much he can do in an hour which he agreed Ben installed the two lights on a nonflat surface and on one of the lights a difficult angle and reach Ben used his own tools and I advised him to bring specialized tools which I didnt have to drill into concrete which I didnt know how to do either Ben did tactfully completed this task Since I was satisfied I decided to proceed with Bens services for the second hour to install the door reinforcer and fix the cabinet hinges Ben and I strategized ways to install the door reinforcer He used another special tool to remove the trim after taking measurements and I suggested fasteners were better than the screws the manufactured provided Ben already had a tray of different screws including the fasteners prepared Ben installed the door reinforcer with the fasteners and tested it He successfully accomplished this task Third Ben was able to easily fix the cabinet screws and now the cabinet works fine Conclusion Ben took 100 minutes of 120 minutes to finish all four tasks Mathematically speaking Ben finished the job 20 minutes faster and was 16 more efficient than I expected In terms of efficacy on a scale on 15 5 being the best I rate him a 5 out of 5 I highly recommend Ben on future projects   Side note Bens professional experience AND Bachelors AND Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering makes him standout as a
5,Very Professional He has done so many jobs on my properties since 2019 and I couldnt ask for a better
5,Great experience Ben responded promptly and arranged to come fix my broken cabinet door the very next morning even messaging an ETA a few minutes beforehand My broken cabinet door was fixed within 90 minutes and I am very pleased I would not hesitate to call again Thank you
5,Ben can do it all Responsive efficient resourceful and willing to help with on the fly additional fixes Will DEFINITELY be hiring him again in the future
5,We had Ben come in to change the halogen recess lighting in our kitchen to led recess lights Given that the halogen lights were low voltage Ben inspected the lights and didnt unnecessarily rip out the transformer but tested and was able to install the new lights with the existing transformer He also changed the outdoor lights for us and properly caulked them  Given the high quality work he did on his first visit we had him come in and hang 9 paintings in our house A couple of them were really tricky to install extremely high  14ft and another required drilling through a duct  Overall we had a great experience with Ben and would hire him again In addition to knowing his stuff he is extremely courteous and professional to work with
5,Ben did a great job mounting my Samsung Frame TV He showed up in the expected timeframe and also was able to help out with another task on the spot for a reasonable fee He did an excellent job on both projects I appreciated his flexibility and helpfulness

5,The workmanship and componentry looks very sound Also his demeanor was very courteous and professional Plus quick response as well   I definitely recommend him to others
5,Ben came prepared with the tools to do what ever was required It was a small job but not an easy one and required some creative thinking Ben is a very pleasant person to work with and I will definitely use him again He may not be the cheapest rate but he is very intelligent and knows what hes doing
5,Ben was great very responsive and kept us updated throughout the process He fixed the light and also helped snake the plumbing Would recommend
5,Ben did a wonderful job assembling and installing heavyduty industrial shelving in my garage including attaching them to the studs so they cant ever tip over Not the simple task you might imagine because neither the floor nor the walls were level or straight so he had to fashion wood spacers to make them level and secure Great job and a lovely guy
5,Ben was great to work with Very flexible and knowledgeable Fixed our main issue efficiently and also did a few other things I asked him if he could do on the spur of the moment
5,He replaced a garbage disposal and changed some outdoor lighting He was efficient and punctual I will call him for future projects
5,Ben had outstanding workmanship and was an excellent communicator I sprung a leak and Ben promptly communicated  was able to have everything fixed in a matter of hours from when I first reached out He fixed exactly what I was hoping to have completed and had great quality of work
5,Ben was way late but hed agreed to do the job the same day since he was so booked the next several days Once he got here he went right to work The job was in his own words a nightmare but he persevered Hes kind of expensive but I really needed his help The job putting pedal extenders on my cars brake and gas pedals was difficult because of the pair Id selected they were inexpensive and Id been warned not at all easy to put on He got the job done and Im very pleased I used them for the first time today and I felt safe and they seemed very secure and on the exact right spot for me to drive comfortably and safely
5,Ben was super quick to respond and was at my house within 30 min for some light kitchen repair He did an awesome job Would highly recommend
5,Ben is a true professional and did incredible work installing a new kitchen faucet and all our Google Home products He is flexible communicates well and does quality work  always going the extra mile
5,Ben repaired some sliding closet doors so that they glide very smoothly Even with some underlying uneven construction that made the job very difficult he persisted and made it work  good as new

5,Ben Handy is absolutely outstanding From start to finish I contacted him to get a quote for a few small things around my house I sent them some pictures regarding the projects to be done he contacted me extremely fast with a reasonable quote I supplied material that I got on my own from Home Depot but he mentioned that he can also get the materials for you We made a 9 am appointment and he showed up 10 min early 850 am He wore his mask did prep at the start and clean up at the end allandall he finished 3 little jobs within 2 and half hours Very impressive  I highly recommend Ben Handy for your home  business repairs  installation
1,Updating this review to terrible because of the following issues   Ben Fixed a broken door in an emergency and I hired him for more work   We hired him to fix a leak in the ceiling some locks and seal a toilet and didnt do a good job and charged us a lot  We are trying to start our bar business back up after the pandemic   We arranged to meet at the venue at 9am He showed up at 2pm because he was hungover from drinking the previous night  After arriving he said he needed to shop for parts He took an excessive amount of time to shop and look for parking because he was hungover He continued to charge us 100hour for this extremely slow shopping time  His patching of the ceiling is unprofessional and half baked See the pictures We are hiring a new contractor to fix this botched job  He is ok for quick repairs that take one hour or less  But do not hire him for large jobs He will rip you off
5,Ben was extremely professional and his work spoke for itself
5,Knowledgeable kind and efficient A little pricey 
5,Ben was great
5,They gave me a great price on painting my deck and my entire house  They helped me picked up colors for the house and it came out so beautiful after all the painting was done They found a problem with the holes in my house and they help me solve the problem Plus they pointed out the my gutters were dirty  They provided me with excellent service  They were friendly and nice  Plus they were busy with other clients and I like how they were able to fit me in their busy schedule I like their service so much I hired them again for another project in august I will refer all my friends and family  I have been getting so many compliments about the color of my house and now it feels like a brand new how  Im so in love with it thank you again
5,Pedros and company are great people and excellent painters and handymen They did a great job paint our large home and casita and also took care of handywork around the house  Highly recommended
5,Pablo was very easy to work with he answered any questions I may have and if I did find something he was quick to do fix what ever I needed YES I would recommend this company

5,They take their work seriously and was professional and responsive
1,I called Pedro for a consultation He was friendly enough on the phone and even made an appointment to come to my house I waited but he never showed up No phone call no message just didnt show Horrible way to conduct business
4,Pedros arrived as scheduled  was super reliable  was responsive to the areas that needed special attention Thanks Pedros for doing the job so quickly
4,Pedros crew was always punctual and professional They had to reschedule a few days due to weather and finishing other jobs so the entire project took a week They addressed touch up and siding repair concerns as we asked because the first attempt at repairing siding did not look complete Overall quality of the paint coverage was good
4,I like Pedros as a company But one frustration was scheduling the appointment for an estimate at dusk As a result the paint we selected was not correct and I was stuck for an additional 70 charge because they bought the wrong shade of paint It seems to me he stuck me with extra paint that he said he couldnt return Generally the job was well done
4,Very good communication with Pedros on time and quick to respond always Starting out first day power washer broke no work that day After that seemed like the project painting exterior was in a bit of a hurry as expected Painting got done by Pedro and his helper When clean up touch up and walk through came Pedros helper went to Russia for two weeks leaving Pedro alone with no other helper I had changed a color on a couple doors so Pedro had to make time to get that done hurriedly so some minor areas were overlooked he had to go to another job I understand that this is a hard business to find employees This is not a team of workers I did appreciate Pedros expertise in recognizing dry rot and repair
4,We liked working with Pedros He was efficient and got the job done quickly   My only suggestion is to make sure they spot clean a bit as some paint was left on our floors that I had to clean after However I feel if I would of caught it earlier they would of fixed it
4,Pedros house painting was very quick with the estimate and the work The price was reasonable and I was very satisfied with the work

4,He will be painting my bathroom this coming Sat Cant rate his work until it is complete
2,Price was fair response was fast Downside left several unpainted spots didnt mask so our wood floors have splatter around the entire house light fixtures Doesnt cut with masking so its that soft line from your base to walls Preference but in a lot of areas just looks lazy and incomplete Ive got a high walk in the staircase that absolutely needed another coat You see the white coming through the yellow he painted A rail wall completely missed painting right in the middle about 14 of it He took all the blinds down then after saying hed put them all back up left most of them down A week later Im still putting blinds back up and cleaning up after him He wont respond to my text since he got paid Not confident I would use him again Maybe in a pinch if Im desperate Just too many cut corners and seems to not care after the project to make anything right
2,Pedro painted our home in August And to be fair he did a good paint job except the front door see picture BUTHe was planning on painting the outside of our home our bathroom vanity and our master bedroom After he finished the outside and wanted to be paid for that apart of the job which we happily did he claimed he had to leave the state for his brothers wedding and would call the beginning of Sept to do the inside After not hearing from him I had to text to ask when he would return I was then told his grandfather was sick in the hospital and to please wait for him I waited a few more weeks and decided to go on this thumbtack app to contact him To my surprise I find 3 new reviews for jobs in Sept Wow Why not tell me he had bigger jobs to do and I should find someone else instead of lying I now have to hire someone else Here is a picture of the front door he painted Opps missed a spot Grrrr To Pedrobeing honest could have very well saved you from a bad review
2,Appointment was not kept by Pedros Blamed me for the problem Did not keep initial appointment time and then was on the other side of town when it was time to get together  Did call and phone not available but still not adapt at time management w appts
2,Spoke to them to discuss what I needed and they told me they would call back in a couple of hours to set up an estimate I never received a call back I used the plumber that installed my toilets originally
2,He was rushed and quickly unmasked his tape leavings lots of problem areas that never cured He came back the next day for touch up but you can only do so much with torn parts
3,No follow thru Once he was paid no response to our requests for itemized receipt
2,Tried to cancel start date Agreed to work 12 days Not prepared
1,1Complete the project  2 Refund clients money 50 for not painting mantle and leaving paint

5,Very honest and Fair Good workmanship
1,Repeatedly scheduled times with me then never showed up Only let me know that he wasnt going to make it after I text him asking him to confirm that he was still coming Would not recommend using him
1,This guy does not display professionalism He wanted the appointment to be in the middle of the day on a Sunday I called him in the morning to verify appointment and left a voicemail which he didnt return I drove a distance to meet him at the house and 40 minutes before appointment he sent a message through thumbtack asking to change appointment This guy is not very friendly either
1,i wouldnt recommend WHAT an experience hire this contractor after being told when he would start only to be told two days later he forgot about me Me being a developerowner conveyed to pedro thats very unprofessional he seems to got offended and said now he couldnt do the job wow  wish i would have known this before hand in my business time is money big mistake
1,He came to my house for a free estimate to paint some rooms in my house and he had an opportunity to see what s to paint and gave me the quote Then over the phone he changed the quotes becuz of doors to paint on He was here to see everything that needed to be painted on and he changed the quotes becuz of the doors When I decided to reduce the number of rooms for him to paint due to high cost of the work He technically did not reduce much to the point where I realize he is not reliable with the price Thanks to him for his effort
1,Was supposed to come at 7 am to paint one bathroom   Never showed Called and he said he had to finish another job  Said he left message but did not on my home phone or cell
1,The quotes price was 13 of any other quote and the time estimated was half of others This lead me to believe they didnt know the job like other pros They also refused to give a license number after I requested it Even though they claimed to be licensed I would be hesitant to hire this company

4,Overall a good experience The only complaints that I have are that the installer kindly helped me by picking up the tv from the store but I was never informed that there would be a 50 charge to drive a couple of miles and putting the tv in his truck Also I thought that paying to put the cords behind the wall included the necessary equipment to do the job not having to go to the store to pick up the items Otherwise everything else was fine I just wish that the communication was better
5,A FixTMan crew came and mounted 3 TVs in my home They were fast and worked clean They even handled a difficult task of mounting over a marble slab Fireplace

5,The service was very good They were very prompt in their responses and arrived on time for the job They were wearing a mask very courteous and professional We had 2 outdoor items to build and they completed the job quickly and it looks great
5,100010 would recommend Farivar was excellent and super friendly and kind He mounted our tv in no time Super a nice guy
5,Shervin was excellent extremely knowledgeable fast really fast  respectful Id hire him again in a heartbeat
5,Although the person came in late it was made up by the quality of work  Very happy with the set up
5,The guys from FixTman did an excellent job they were very respectful wore the proper ppe and are super clean and efficient I would not hesitate to hire them for future projects TV looks amazing
5,Great service Arrived on time and did a great job Im very happy
5,EXCELLENT Pro put my IKEA bed together fast and flawlessly
3,Surprisingly I did not have a very good experience with FixTman but I want to note they did give a lot of opportunity to make things right   It all starts when I reached out when the time window of arrival was closing and I was never contacted about the technician being late and I had to reach out myself Ultimately I had waited the entire time and didnt get any update on when the technician would arrive until well after the time window had passed They were understanding and apologetic saying this never happens unfortunately it did for me Real professionalism I would have expected them to contact me if there were schedule issues at the very least They gave me a slight discount for the troubles and genuinely wanted to make up for it so I do appreciate that Finally about 2 hours after the arrival window the technician arrived They had communicated the final time after but nevertheless it was still later than that time  The technician was rushed very rushed The attention to detail was not there I paid for an entire TV mounting yet I was expected to help I actually had to change my plans to be there that late and I still had to lift the heavy TV on and off of the mount a few times and he even asked my wife to help as well Why am I paying for an installation when Im so actively helping I dont mind helping but I also would rather not be paying for myself to do some of the work It just seemed really weird  In addition I told him clearly and marked exactly where and how high to mount the TV but even then its still too low and not where I wanted it He really didnt want to go the extra mile to make sure I was happy  I didnt want to fight it or make it worse Its just not worth my time But now I have a nice new TV mounted in a suboptimal way Its supposed to be really flush with the wall but he used an extension chord that is in the way which he also asked me to pay for We wouldnt need an extension chord if he actually put the TV in the right spot and cut the inwall channel in the middle rather than way over on the right  Overall it was a really rushed job and I had to help out a lot Also I was told they wouldnt haul the boxesshipping material away but would put it in the trashrecycling but he also didnt do it I just wanted him to finish because it was so rushed and unpleasant I spent another hour breaking down the box and cleaning up afterwards and then spent another hour trying to fix the mistakes and get the TV flush like it should be There were so many steps he didnt do and even mentioned that those steps were for amateurs Unfortunately that also means amateurs do a good job at making sure the mount is flush and setup as designed  The technician was nice but the rushed nature sucked  The company did say they would have a QC technician come out to take a look and fix if they could They would honor a 30 day guarantee So I definitely think they want to make it right and I think they would But the QC technicians window of arrival was a huge 3 hour window the next day That additional stress of it all waiting again for 3 hours just wasnt going to cut it for me  They genuinely want to do the right thing but man I really didnt have a good time and maybe Ill ultimately take their offer to get their QC technician out here but it was just not a good experience at all and I really dont know if I want to deal with another round of it  I think the way to make this right 1 Have the technician come at an EXACT time not a 3 hour window 2 Refund me some more portion of the cost because of how much I was expected to help 3 Actually redo the job patch up the holes and not require my help maybe bring a second or third technician  I hope this is just a one time thing and that otherwise they are great at what they do I will be looking elsewhere and just wanted to leave this in case its useful

3,They were only able to complete half the job they were hired to do Before hiring I asked if they can mount a TV and a security camera They asked for the model and link to the camera and then confirmed yes they could   The day of the appointment they tell me prefer not to come at the prescheduled time bc I am too far I was flexible so I allowed them to come the next day Fatima was pleasant and kind Mounted my TV fine but the man complained that fishing the wires behind the wall would be too difficult even though I would be paying 50 just for fishing and my previous mounters fished it through the wall without saying a peep and no charge Then I gave them my camera he took one look and said he couldnt do it bc of the wires It is a standard Ring camera and I showed them the exact model before hiring them I hired them specifically bc I wanted the camera mounted along with the tv I couldve gone to previous tv mounters who are cheaper had they been honest that they actually cannot mount cameras   Overall they can mount if your TV and other straightforward jobs If you have curveballs or a complicated set up will likely need to look elsewhere
5,The booking process was smooth The pro showed up on time and did a good job for the furniture assembling
5,The tech was on time and very courteous He texted several times to confirm prior to showing up He completed the job quicker and I expected as well

5,Technician was very knowledgeable and got the work done quickly and effectively
5,They were super fast both to respond to my initial inquiry and to mount my TV It was less than 24 hours between when I first reached out to them and my TV was mounted
3,Wasnt what I expected for the cost Usually when I get my tv mounted I dont have to worry about the company having extra tools and the right equipment I need to now go to Home Depot and hide the wires properly myself because in one room it wasnt done right and looks crazy and in the other room they didnt do it at all because the cover they have only conceals up to 3 wires Shouldnt advertise a service you cant provide to satisfaction Have different size quality covers and be prepared at the amount you are charging or lower your prices along with customer expectations I wouldnt hire this company again or recommend them
5,The team that came and mounted our outdoor TV was punctual professional and did a great job They had our TV mounted on a tilting mount in about 45 minutes on stucco with no issues or mess They hid the power chord deftly and had extra supplies to get the job done when we had to make changes on the fly Highly recommend sending photos of your job in advance so that the crew knows what to expect   I would highly recommend them to anyone and use them again for future work
5,Mansour and Reza were punctual professional responsive proficient quick and made things so easy for me Their online site was really easy to maneuver and they even made it easy to pay Ill be using them again for the 65 TV Ill need mounted soon My only small constructive comment is that it wouldve been nice if they had covers for their shoes but since I was still moving in it wasnt a big deal at all Would absolutely recommend
5,I got my adjustable desk assembled by them and the work was efficient and fast Communication was very clear I knew how much I was paying what time the technician would be dropping by etc I would highly recommend FixTman
5,Farivar did a great job helping me with tv mount installation
5,Farivar did a perfect job mounting my TVs He was on time and worked fast
5,5 star seemless experience  They came on time and were very polite We had a 85 inch tv and they did a fantastic job in wall mounting it  We had earlier compared cost and this was the cheapest and by a long margain Will highly recommend their services its a no brainier
5,I had FixTman assemble a Ab Booster Plus for me He came on time and assembled the machine very quickly and had me try the machine to make sure it worked Very professional and I recommend him
5,The guys gave me a call and told me exactly when they will come they were accurate to the minute They were also accommodating in changing the time slot in the same day  When they came in we realized that we wont be able to use the existing mount They were very effective in suggesting a mount that would fit the TV model I had for which they gave me a fair price They installed it perfectly and cleanly super happy
5,was so easy to schedule and the work was completed quickly thank you
5,Received a piece of furniture in the morning and they were able to come by on short notice Excellent communication courteous and did an excellent job of assembling our cabinet
5,Great attention to detail and helped me choose the location and better position for the TV
5,They did an excellent job mounting our 65 inch TV They were very quick and on time Did the job neatly with wires concealed  I would highly recommend them for any TV mounting services
5,I was so impressed with this service They gave me a range from 123 but I contacted the company to inform them that I had to leave by 230 I was told no problem and these guys showed up right at 12pm When do you ever get that these days   The communication from the minute I made the request was exemplary   The two technicians were very friendly professional and fast 30 minutes later when he called for me I thought he had a question but they had already mounted and installed my 55 inch flat screen TV Just a quit setup and they were completely finished   I will definitely use FixTman again which will be in a couple of weeks for my next project   I highly recommend this company 5 Stars plus
2,I sent two pictures of where I wanted TVs mounted and described that one is in ceiling and one is on brick The tech that was assigned was very hesitant to do the work and expected me to do a lot of helping Ultimately he left the job undone because apparently the dispatching person did not share the description nor pictures with the tech that was assigned and the tech let me know that he had shoulder surgery and could not do my install after lots and lots of texts and phone calls to prompt me to commit to hiring them I was so frustrated with the situation that I decided to not continue with this contractor when they offered to send out a different tech on a different day Im sharing the pics I used to communicate the expected scope of wormYou tell me if it is not clear where and what and how a tv will be mounted from the pictures that I shared with them So I was extra insulted when the tech wasnt aware of the scope of work before he showed up at my house
5,The technician came was very polite and professional They did a great job mounting my tv
2,We provided a detailed project description to this business The initial contact went well and they sent a really clear itemized invoice right afterwards which made us feel really confident in their work   However the technician showed up and said he didnt know the scope of the job he didnt bring the tv mount we paid for and he told us he couldnt complete the job because he had another job to get to in 15 hours   While he was here working he didnt bring a shop vac or a ladder for a light fixture installing and tv mounting job He asked to step up on our toddler high chair we said no and he also banged our new TV against the couch and laid is on the edge of the couch display side down
5,Very punctual and was great to work with good outcome and happy with the results
5,Theyre pretty cool professionals Many Thanks Im glad I chose them
5,Great communication and quickaccurate service Hired the team for a 77in tv installation complex as it was on a brick wall they did a great job
4,Although there were a couple hiccups in scheduling and arrival time overall read satisfied with the work Advised that mount purchased was not going to fit in recessed wall but had a reasonably priced mount they ended up Installing that met our goals for side swivel
5,Very professional did a great job Assembly was done perfectly with no damage
5,I had a really great experience using this service You guys were very responsive and worked quickly I will definitely be using you again in the future
5,Will definitely hire again  Farivar was beyond excellent
5,Very nice and professional got here on time highly recommend this guys 
5,The technician was very professional and did an amazing job on my tv stand Im extremely happy with the service
2,They arrived on time with all the right tools but I found the person who helped me to be challenging and lacked precision   First the curtain rods in my living room are not hung up straight and when I said that he suggested they were properly leveled Second one bracket was not properly screwed into the wall and I had to point it out for him to fix it   Next I had him hang up a curtain rod in my childs room and said I wanted the curtains to hang six inches to the side of the window He hung the curtain rod directly on top of the window and then said he couldnt move it because there were no studs I found it frustrating that I found this out after explicitly stating where I wanted the curtain rod   For 180 I wouldve expected better communication and precision
5,Perfect installation The team was fast and efficient They made sure things were in working order and in proper placement Would definitely recommend their services
5,I needed a new Nordictrac recumbent studio bike assembled Its a fairly complex assembly The work was done quickly and professionally I highly recommend FixTman for similar projects
5,They did a great job helping me mount my tv Initially I had a ceiling mount they were able to help me get the correct mount Thank you Will use again for future projects
5,The two installers ended up coming early they called ahead to make sure it was ok They did stellar work and checked with me throughout Id highly recommend them
5,We had an amazing experience with our TV installation Professionally done Great attitude and very flexible with our schedule
5,Yes I would recommend them without hesitation Mansour was very professional and caring and did a great job and also came at a good time to do the work
2,Fixtman charged me 179 bucks to assemble an ikea bookcase qnd crib The bpokcase needs 2 people according to the manual Fixtman claimed their techs are very experienced and 1 is enough  The technician who came was about to nail the wrong side of centre shelf which cannot be repaired later He could not fit the doors We read the manual and told him how to do it He placed all the shelving upside down and did not fit some parts which were required for soft close We also had to help him with the hanging of the shelf for which they charged an extra 50 dollars He did not see the L clamps and their hole size before drilling He was about to drill a large hole which would have made it impossible to fit the shelf   All in all we had to read the manual and oversee quite a bit I felt bad for the technician since he did not seem experienced and fixtman just sent him without an additional person So if you want to hire fixtman make sure you have someone at home to help them and oversee also figure out if its worth your money
5,Great experience very professional  quick Would definitely recommend for future projects
5,Shervin showed up and got the  job done fast and efficiently
5,He was awesome Knowledgeable and friendly Thank you so much
5,Moe answered all of my questions and Im satisfied with the work
2,The installers came in late and seemed in a lot of rush I could not communicate directly with the installer because he wasnt comfortablewilling to speak English But there was another person who helped translate  that and the rush they seemed to be in definitely threw me off  I was misguided on how to center the tv  for an additional cost Since the mount would end up going on the dry wall and not the stud I declined which turned out to be great because the mount itself had a way to adjust the tv horizontally Which I did after they left  Finally the TV was installed 5 inches higher than I had request But then they ran away as soon as it was done before I could get a chance to sit and inspect and all  I am not happy I will just fix it by myself now I guess and will be careful hiring someone on ThubTack
5,Very responsive I wish the marks left on the TV were also cleaned by the folks who came Otherwise they were very professional and courteous
5,Rezas team was top notch 100 satisfied with their quality of work mounting our 3 TVs
2,Hope my experience is an exceptionI hired them because hood review and business volume on this platform 1 After the appointment be set  they sent me text messages They charge reschedule fee and cancel fee I am Ok with it but they rescheduled the appointment at last minute make me spend whole day waiting in the house 2 The guy left without the job done  Until I called the company 3They proposal 85 dollars for my two bookcase assemble after assemble they side they the price for one item This issue cost one hour get settled Everything looks tricky
5,If you need a mounted tv installed Reza team are very professional and complete the install in a matter of no time
5,I appreciated FixTmans professionalism and quality of work They assembled several furniture pieces for me and I was impressed with their care and excellent service Would definitely hire again

3,Update Almost immediately after posting my 1 star review I got a message from the company They apologized and said they were confused because I already had an appointment scheduled to fix the issue at no cost I never got a message asking when I was available or confirming any appointments   When I asked when my appointment was for they said Thursday from 35 Thursday around 1pm I got a text asking if they could come on Friday instead I said I was available before 830 or after 1030 They said okay confirmed  I asked what time my appointment was and they had scheduled me from 8301030 Exactly when I was not available I explained my schedule again and they said they would come at 8   They actually arrived at 805 and fixed everything and it looks great now The end result is great but all the hard work of scheduling and rescheduling this service so many times was not worth it I will not use this company again   Original 1 star review While it seems like they typically have great service I did not have a great experience  I originally scheduled an appointment for 4pm on a Wednesday They arrived at 245 and unfortunately my baby was in the middle of his nap I asked if they could come back at my scheduled time maybe see another client first because I didnt want the sound to wake the baby They said no and asked if they could come the next morning at 8am and I agreed  At 835 the next morning they had not arrived yet I texted them asking if they would be there by 9 because the baby would be napping again at 915 They said there was a lot of traffic and they could not make it by 9 and we rescheduled for the next day at 330 They said We will be there at 330 on the dot  The next day they arrived at 445 They put the tv up and seemed to be in a bit of a rush While they were putting it up I wasnt sure if it was quite right but I saw them measuring and assumed they are the experts and know what they are doing I should have double checked right at that moment When the tv was up it looked fine and they left quickly After looking at the TV a bit longer I realized it was not centered on the fireplace Within an hour I messaged them saying that it was not centered and asking if it could be fixed I specifically said there is 195 inches of space on one side and 165 inches of space on the other side They scheduled an appointment for a few days later at 4 pm  At 345 they called me and said do you still want us to come today or should we come tomorrow I said please come I am ready So they come at 430 One of the guys was there a few days earlier but he did not speak English The other guy was new and he spoke English and acted as translator The guy who was the same immediately started measuring things The new guy looks at me and says Did someone else do this You can see just by looking at it that its not centered And I said no actually you did he was here the other day with someone else And he said wow Im sorry We will make this right   The two men chat a bit and then he tells me we basically have to redo the whole thing They didnt give us much time today They just said you needed it straightened so is it OK if we come back another time He again tells me we will make this right I agree to yet another visit and he tells me that the scheduling service will need to call me to set up time  A few hours later someone calls me and says so it sounds like we have to redo it so I just wanted to see if you still wanted to proceed I ask him to confirm that I will not be charged since it was their mistake We go back and forth a bit he seems to have some incorrect details for example stating thatI asked for service on two tvs which I did not and then he says it seems like maybe we have some inaccurate information and maybe your records got mixed up Is it OK if I give you a call back I say yes and he never calls back So now I paid them almost 200 for a crooked TV and will now have to pay someone else to fix it
5,They came mounted the tv and sound bar I requested and it looks great Just where I wanted it
5,FixTman did a very good job  were fast and efficient and tidy
5,The team did an excellent job They were on time and professional
5,Very capable fast nice and efficient Amazing service
1,The Technician showed up late he then spent 90 minutes trying to figure out the situation which he couldnt   This Soundbar is still here collecting dust 
1,I booked this company last Sunday to assemble my IKEA PAX wardrobe I requested two technicians to complete the task due to the large size of the wardrobe and how heavy the pieces are  They cancelled my appointment on Sunday hours before they were supposed to come because they couldnt find a 2nd technician So I rebooked for the next night Monday and confirmed with them multiple times that two technicians would arrive   Sadly only one person showed up and looked at my wardrobe and said he couldnt do it  Biggest waste of two daysnights for me and still nothing has been assembled They were the quickest to respond to my request on Thumbtack and after reviewing their services I thought it was a good pick based on reviews But I was completely wrong and they took the opportunity away from others on Thumbtack that could have completed the task
1,Flake Initially great responsiveness to book and using their app I was very impressed with the speed and quality of the communications But unfortunately the positive experience ended with the booking communications The person scheduled flaked for the morning appointment and then did not show up again for the rescheduled appointment at the scheduled time   I contacted them 1 hour after appointment time and they then tried to schedule it out AGAIN by another 3 hours later In addition the had the audacity to schedule the same person that flaked for the first appointment for the rescheduled one Really I WILL NOT USE THIS COMPANY
5,Super fast at their work but did arrive late and rescheduled time slot day of
5,Great service mounted my 65 inch TV exactly how I wanted it
1,Even after sharing clear description along with pictures before hand the vendor demanded more money on site stating that the work was under scoped earlier Avoid
1,Ask him to put together a trampoline He didnt even read the instructions They called me and said they need a second person When I examined what he was doing he didnt even read the instructions By the time we got the trampoline set up the net was on backwards and he said he has come back tomorrow to take it apart to put it back together Glad I did not pay prior to the work being done This company should not be in business
5,Farivar was extremely thorough and is clearly a perfectionist I highly recommend
5,Team did a great job putting up our tv in less than 20 minutes Thanks
1,Your service is horrible my appointment was at 10 oclock they did not arrive till 1030 the job is to hang artwork on my high ceiling walls I specified they needed a long ladder when I spoke with a young lady over the phone and when gentleman finally arrived he had no ladder
4,Mansour from FixTman installed the treadmill for us He was late but informed us ahead of time so that we could adjust our planning The installation work was done professionally He set the treadmill properly at the location we set it to He addressed all my questions about the installation and told me to call him if there is any issue we face while using the treadmill He cleared up the area and put everything in the box for easy disposal
5,They were very fast and really professional The TVs came out perfect
1,The technician who had come over to wall mount my TV over the fireplace had no prior information of what needed to be done and insisted that mounting a TV above a fireplace with concealed wires was impossible I had spent time with someone from FixTpro explaining all the details of what needed to be done and shared pictures of the wall concealer kit I had purchased but turns out none of this info was passed on the person who came over STICK TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS
1,They mounted a 65 TV on my living room wall The first time I pulled the tv out so I can see it better from the kitchen the mount has an adjustable arm and is designed for this type of movement the tv and mount fell off the wall They both came right off the wall The company took 0 of the responsibility The TV fell onto a marble table and the tv screen cracked the mount bent and it the iPhone sitting on the table was damaged  They sent two men from the company to assess the damage and take pictures A manager then called and incessantly stated it was not the companys fault due to the evidence ie the pictures THEIR company took and THEIR department reviewed At nauseam he repeated it was not their fault and continued to reference THEIR assessment of the situation and implied that the accident was a result of an outer force applied to it When we asked what this could be his reply insinuated we had done it by maybe applying to much pressure someone hanging from it etc We did neither but had no way of proving it How do we as customers prove to a company with legal council we did no such thing This is unfair and onesided Company v me and my wife Their conclusion that it was not their fault and therefore we would not be compensated is clearly onesided and unfair We are out of about 2500 We would have never imagined that using Thumbtack to refer us to this company would result in a loss of 2500 cost of tv 2000 cost of wall mount 165 cost of installation 185 time and inconvenience   It is 100 their fault and they are taking 0 of the responsibility I will never use this company I will repost this review on Yelp
5,The technicians were prompt experienced and did an excellent job I recommend them highly
5,They were quick and everything they hung for us looks great
2,Its hard to review these people and I feel sorry that this happened to myself but it can happen again and again The main issue is that they send two pros one is the main pro who may or may not speak in English and the other who is actually not a pro but a translator for English This makes it really hard to communicate to the actual person doing the job In our case the translator was very sensitive to our demands took everything personally    Now as for the real review on the work we had to mount a soundbar and also a curtain rod We told them to NOT level the soundbar with the TV as it was not leveled itself and we could adjust the tv later but they didnt hear or didnt understand and weve had to then get in to some argument around it was a terrible experience After that the soundbar was not centered and they again went in to an argument with me about it and I had to bring my own tape measure to show them it was off by a whole darn inch They then fixed it by redoing the screws again so now there are 2x holes behind my soundbar does not show but the shabbiest job ever for a simple mount   Ok now for the curtains they did a good job listening to instructions this time but they left the curtain rod completely lose Me and my wife had to tighten all the brackets with the provided Allen key When I had confronted them that it was lose they said they could manage only that   Terrible service I would never go for these people
5,Great service Timely and really cared about the quality
5,On point insulation was a breeze for these professionals I will recommend them to anyone who is seeking These services
1,Price transparency and price for service actually provided  I was quoted for a very different service to install my TV and consultation on which TV mount to use with TV mounts provided than the service that was actually provided FixTman said that the initial quote that was provided was my final fee despite the many issues encountered services not provided and the parts of the project not completed for example bringing a TV mount that would fit my TV along lines we had discussed which I would pay for Unfortunately it was not an easy customer experience when I contacted FixTman and the situation was not resolved after calling and messaging the Company  I was also contacted by at least three different people via phone email and text at FixTman LLC over a 24 hour period confirming different technicians at different times and days Ultimately a technician arrived a day ahead of what was scheduled and I only knew about it shortly ahead of time   Would suggest a different service at least for TV mounting purposes
1,Missed appointments twice and in 3rd try techs showed up and didnt want to do the job Waste of time
5,They came before time and completed work to satisfaction Would highly recommend

1,I had a man named Derek  He first told me he could do my simple taking apart a couch so it could fit through a door and then putting it back together project  He then calls me and tells me that Im order for the project to happen I need to pay him for moving it upstairs even though he didnt have to move the furniture anywhere I tell him Im not doing that then he calls me to let me know he cant do the project and to cancel my appointment Also he kept calling more than 10 times until I finally had to block him  Update Charlie is a man on this app who decided to contact me and tell me that he thought my project was fake so he decided to screw me over and cancel my appointment  I had proof of a picture I sent to them I told them ahead of time that I did not have instructions because I bought it off of another person  If my project was fake why did I give a real number real email address real pictures real address All I wanted was for someone to take apart my couch so I can move it to another location   Charlie proceeds to harass me about taking this review down He said that everything Im stating is a lie   I mean seriously how rude all because I didnt pay you an extra 85 to take it literally 5 seconds away  I will never come back on here again

5,Great overall experience
2,I bought a new MantleMount one of those tv mounts that drops down over a fire place and needed it installed I filled in my information request exactly what I needed how heavy my tv was pictures etc and then was told the day before that I would need to help the one guy coming unless I wanted to pay more Im nine months pregnant and obviously wasnt up for helping hold a 70 tv I found this to be deceiving that they quoted me low but then had these additional charges for extra guys and an additional charge for dismounting my current tv when I clearly stated in my initial job request that my tv would need to be dismounted I would have appreciated transparency with the initial quote  they quoted me 180 and it ended up being closer to 300  The worst part was the guys that came out seemed to have never installed a mount like this before They placed the mount way too low at first and it wouldnt even come back up over the mantle They came back after I had to measure and prove to them that they could place it higher without hitting the ceiling and then they placed it way too high and didnt even make the sound bar flush with the tv Eventually my husband and fatherinlaw redid it and now it looks good but it took a lot of work since the guys that came out stripped a lot of the screws the mount came with   Im giving them 2 stars for coming out to try and fix it but ultimately we had to fix it a third time ourselves to get it right Wish I could get my 300 back Also just a small note but the cologne one man was wearing was way too strong and left a scent in the room for the day As a nurse I dont wear perfume at work because I know people might be sensitive to it I believe these guys should adopt a similar approach to customer service   The photos are of the mount way too high and the sound bar not flush and my husband measuring it when it was too low and realizing it could go up and not hover over the mantle we took the sound bar off so it wouldnt hover over the mantle  even though the pros said you couldnt take it off   In the future I hope these guys just say up front if they dont know how to do a job versus do it incorrectly and try to convince me its right and theres nothing else they can do and leave They kept saying it would hit the ceiling if it was higher or that the sound bar cant come off Both of which we discovered were untrue   Would not recommend
5,They came on time Quality of work is good

5,Wouldnt recommend service   Left large amount of wire exposed about 2 feet horizontally Cut holes in the wall even though he knew he couldnt hide the wires and this would be the result   I dont know why he wouldnt tell me he couldnt properly hide the wires because of the studs BEFORE he drilled two big holes in my drywall  Recommending an electrician after the holes were already drilled is unhelpful Disappointed  Edited Review  After leaving the above review I was contacted by customer service and a HUGE effort was made to make the service right We discussed expectations versus what they are permitted to do and we came to an agreement Even offered to come out again  These folks arent electricians so they are limited in their ability to do complicated jobs I would hire them to do work for me again if I dont care if wires are exposed in a second Will make sure my expectations are known in advance of job  Tech was fast and nice he even went out of his way to buy a less visible cord for us
5,The Tech Mehrdad is a pro I hired him to install my 6 drawer chest and he did it with utmost perfection He arrived on time and immediately started doing the job He was extremely professional Would love to work with AmzTech again in the future

1,Hemi reached out to me and said hell price match my job and will come at an even earlier time than the competitor who I confirmed with So I cancelled with my original guy and moved forward with AmzTech then they called me 15 min before our appointment saying they cant make it and will have to reschedule for tomorrow Ummmmmmm no thanks Not reliable Makes it extra frustrating when I asked to leave work early to make the appointment only for them not to be able to make it on time

3,Average
5,Great experience working with Kevin He mounted our tv and hung a few heavy mirrors He was timely professional and friendly Would definitely recommend Kevin for
3, 1 star for professional and prompt communication in the app  1 star for showing up on time  1 star for the portion of the work completed  Minus 2 stars for working extremely slow Details below  Why I rated 3 stars I only give 4 stars when I have zero complaints and I only give 5 stars when someone goes above and beyond in a truly spectacular way Thats why this was a 3 Other people rank simply passable average work as 5 stars but thats not the way I rate  Job Pulling weeds by hand Rate 49hr At the end he tried to say the rate was 60hr but I had our DMs where hed previously quoted 49hr  Details I asked Kevin to weed our small front yard and pull a few other weeds along an adjacent sidewalk I was clear upfront that I only wanted to pay for two hours max After 90 minutes  hed only weeded a corner that was about 4x4 and I asked him to pay attention to other areas with big obvious easilypullable weeds that were still sitting there He seems to pay a lot of attention to minuscule details while ignoring bigger more obvious things like 3 tall dandelions and entire swaths of tall weeds I wouldnt describe him as efficient eg using a weak leaf blower to blow 2 inches of dirt at a time when sweeping would be sooo much faster I asked him to stop after two hours since that was my agreement upfront He said hed add a few extra minutes for free and that he usually throws that in for clients He has a pleasant if slightly awkward communication styledemeanor But wow the slowness  even with a migraine I could have gotten more accomplished in half the time   The kicker is that the assigned work isnt complete  I either have to hire someone else to finish pulling the weeds or just do it myself For contrast I previously had someone on Craigslist to weed the entire front yard plus the parking strip in ONE hour for 50 I wish Id saved his number Hiring hourly on Thumbtack is frustrating  It would be better if we could price a job at a flat rate no matter how long it takes because hourly pricing seems to encourage people to work as slowly as possible Kevin is a nice guy but not a match for my expectations Good luck
5,Kevin was punctual  professional and excellent skills
5,Thank you so much Kevin Kevin was very nice responsive came and fixed all the things in 2 hours on the same day and the charges are very reasonable
5,The ivy overgrown mess in my oblong planter was transformed into a neat attractive planter box Now the other plants that were struggling are visible and have room to grow I also received some free plant food and some tips on maintaining the plants
4,I told Kevin I was available for him to come on Wednesday He asked if he could come at 830am I said yes At 823 he messaged to say he needed to come between 9 and 930 instead I said fine He came at closer to 10 I had one coatrack that I needed to mount and two leaky sinks He fixed the coatrack right away and it is now secure For both sinks he said that the leak couldnt be fixed and I needed to replace the faucets on both of them He offered to help me order new faucets but I declined His work inspecting the faucets and mounting the coatrack took less than an hour so he asked me if I had anything else he could help with
5,Kevin helped me bring my shelf vision to life by mounting a TV and installing an Elfa shelving unit He made suggestions to make it more sturdy and aesthetically pleasing even sawing off excess ends of the rods 1010 would hire again
5,Kevin was able to help us analyze a major problem with a broken Murphy bed He sent me instructions on what we needed to buy which was greatly appreciated He hung a heavy mirror and a couple other mini things around the house Highly recommend
1,Arranged for him to work 47pm his preference No show We considered a calendar mix up but he failed to respond to attempts to confirm check and verify When we finally reached him by phone he stated he had not placed us on his schedule after all Summary Lack of communication professionalism in common problem solving and clarity in communication This man does not know me spouse kids et al That number of individuals is even referenced is unacceptable
5,Kevin did a great job installing outside shades mirror bathroom hardware and fixing a light I will definitely hire him again
5,Once he was finished Kevin had done a great job hanging heavy mirrors and curtains Everything was level and he used quality mounting materials He was fast and affordable I would work with him again in the future
5,Kevin did a terrific job of painting the living room and patching up the walls We were also working on replacing the bathroom sink faucet but some major plumbing issues require us to hire a plumber I would definitely hire Kevin again
5,Kevin assembled 2 West Elm chairs for me He was very professional and friendly and he put the chairs together quickly I will definitely work with him in the future
5,Kevin installed a pet door for me and it looks great Scheduling was a little challenging but once we had a time confirmed everything went smoothly
5,Very knowledgeable and kind A pleasure to work with Did a great job For a great price
5,This was a great experience for me I been trying to get my bed put together for two years but lost some screws when I moved here Kevin was able to achieve what no one could and he did it very professionally and fast
5,Kevin was very professional and knowledgeable about plants He was very polite and made helpful suggestions
5,High quality work Very responsive and always arrived on time
1,Kevin is a kind guy but the work he did planting our trees was not well done We asked for 7 trees to be planted  and specified that we needed with holes dug 2x wide filled with new soil and gopher wire He did not do this Instead  the holes for all 7 trees were dug 24 inches wider than the root ball   only 1 tree was given new soil we purchased extra bags of soil for this and pointed them out to Kevin but he did not use them  only 2 trees were planted with gopher wire   We are currently replanting all 7 trees The avocado started to die because it was surrounded by clay instead of enough new soil and there were a lot of air pockets Kevin said it was normal for the tree to lose all leaves and come back next yearbut that didnt seem right Poor tree Weve replanted it with a hole twice as wide as the root ball new soil and leaves have stopped dropping New buds are forming Super thankful   This has been very frustratingWe paid 400 dollars across 2 visits and have to redo the work  the right way We will not work with Kevin again or recommend his services
5,Even though the job was small Kevin responded quickly and was super easy to work with
1,I tried to reach out to him regarding a small project we needed assistant with I heard back a day later so I thought Great He can help us  I dont know if it wasnt a big enough job or hes just too busy but I would respond to his message and not hear anything several times So I called him to ask if he was still interested he said he would call me back and let me know when he could come to our house Once again he did not respond Im frustrated because I would just rather someone tell me they arent interested than give me the run around
5,Very timely replies Professional
5,Job well done at very reasonable price
1,Awful communication skills and very unprofessional He canceled 3 times within a hour of project This app needs accountability for individuals that operate like this thumbtack you have the capability to track message between the individuals with that information it would cut down on individuals like Kevin not showing up or being inconsiderate of someone elses time
5,I Brown him out to Texas to redo my floors and redo one of my rooms in the house every respectable and responsible takes pride in his work always on time also he did a fantastic job on getting everything back to the way it should be no more saggy doors and the room he did is so much better then it was it was always cold and seemed wet or a damp smell he found and fixed the problem and it stays warm like the rest of the house no more wasting money on heaters to warm the house I will have him come back to redo my guest house
5,We had some water damage to the floor in the front room I contacted passed the torch and he redid the flooring in the living room and kitchen He did an amazing job
5,It all starts with the right knowledgeable contractor We were fortunate enough to have Angelo We will certainly use him again for other jobs if needed
5,Angelo came to fix and reinstall a few light fixtures and repair some entryways as well as a few different things around the house Ive been putting off getting repaired for months He was fast and did an amazing job on everything and now Im in sheer bliss with these upgrades and appreciate just being home and inviting company This recommendation is the least I could offer for such a job well done by a professional with a great personality Definitely using this service again

5,Im extremely satisfied with the work that Max did for me for many reasons First he is responsive and accommodating Many other people I contacted were flaky and ghosted me but not Max He responded quickly to my requests and questions Mostly Im happy with his creative solution I hated my bedroom closet and wanted to tear it out and start all over Maxs quote came in at 14 of the price of other vendors because he had a creative solution that was perfect I couldnt be happier with the results and would have no hesitation in recommending Max to anyone who needs work done but is looking for a costefficient solution
5,Best contractorhandymen Ive hired for my beachside apartment Max and Juan floored the pantry upgraded my bathroom and fixed my closet doors Really smart and easy to work with I highly recommend Max and team and plan to call them in the future
5,In my case he was not able to offer a solution after we discussed the problem but I really liked his professionalism and candor and now that I have a better idea of his areas of expertise I would definitely call him for future projects
5,Carlos was great Great with quality and within budget
3,while the quality of the work was excellent it took longer than anyone expected and therefore also cost more i was ok with it costing more the task required it but i was uncomfortable with the idea that i had no idea how much it would cost in the end until it was done
5,This was our first experience working with Max and we are very pleased He did a great job was very professional and did exactly what he promised in repairing and rebuilding our 2 gates Hes also trustworthy and we felt comfortable having him around while we were coming and going to and from appointments throughout the day I basically explained what we wanted and he made it happen We had wood from our gate that he also salvaged and repurposed during the rebuild of the gate which helped save on costs especially since lumber costs have gone way up Hes very competent in his work and our gates look great and function properly as well I would hire Max again for other stuff as well because he did such a great job and was very reliable That hasnt been my experience with other people I have hired in the past I had to chase them down Max shows up and gets the job done Hire him you wont be disappointed

5,Did the requested job well and with no supervision Trust him to do a good job
5,Everything went well Carlos was on time and his work was perfect Highly recommended
5,A very good first experience I will have Maximilian back for more work

5,Georgi did an excellent job Needed a cabinet trimmed for space for a refrigerator and he did the job exactly to my expectations Would highly recommend him and would use his services again

3,Responsive but flakey first scheduled for nov 6th for around 10am then pushed it back to 1pm one day before the job sends a message that he needs to reschedule for the next day Also wanted to charge a 3 hour minimum because we are outside of Los Angeles but our city is in Los Angeles Not really reliable

2,We are not living in the house yet where the work was done I paid for this job based on photos provided but when I went over to the house I saw that EB Tile did not complete the job in an area not photographed They also left scuff marks on the newly painted walls and made some holes in the walls I called right away and Enrique said he would come finish the job and patch up the holes but he never showed up and didnt respond to messages after that Additionally there were some painters working at the house at the same time who left their equipment at the house and they believe the person working for EB Tile JP stole their equipment and paint Overall it was a really bad experience

1,Never will I hire this so call
1,I had high hopes of having a great experience with this contractor Unfortunately he appears to be very disorganized and very unreliable We set up an appointment for an estimate on Sunday afternoon The appointment time came and went with no him not showing up I ended calling him an hour after the scheduled appointment time and he said he was on his way He finally showed up three hours late  The following Tuesday he texted me asking my availability for the week I told him I was available Wednesday and Friday morning I didnt hear back from him again until Friday morning telling me that we could shoot for the following Tuesday He was told if he could give me a firm appointment for Tuesday we could do the job Needless to say I never heard back from him and the job was never done This a very poor way to run a business Buyer beware
4,No receipts or guarantees he wanted cashwe gave it to him He work good yet work wasnt completed we were told he could do the job He came w no ladder or ample equipment Hes a good worker yet he seemed to be in a rush so all the work wasnt completely done Yet the pay he requested to be the same I later found out they didnt guarantee his work she later said what do you mean guarantee She then said Ill give a weeks guarantee When I called back later that night the day that the work was done to say the contact film was bubbling up on the sliding door thats when I was told shed get back to me Its been two days Ive yet to hear from Rains pressure washing This was a first with hiring a
5,Rains Services was very responsive and accomplished my laundry list of home todos Will return for future needs They assembled a shed helped me move heavy furniture and hung lights and upside
5,Ayal was very quick to respond Ken showed up very positive and ready to fix my fence which he did super quick and professional My next door neighbor already reached out with his instant approval of what Ken did as well Thank you Rain Services for an outstanding job
5,Rains services were very prompt in response and committed to their scheduled time He was respectful punctual and did an awesome job
5,Came on time and did an excellent job at assembling the shed we had just bought very competitive price will definitely contact them for future projects
5,On time Good work I called them for fan installation and closet shelves installation Garage resin paint Everything was done in a day
5,Great response time from beginning to end on the project Techs were extremely friendly and courteous I struggled to get several vendors prior and Rains finally got it Thanks
5,He did a great job uninstalling my camera doorbell and installing a new one He also dismounted my television from the wall He was fast  professional I recommend his services
5,They cleaned my windows from paint overspray and also sealed and pressure washed my pavers Quality work for fair prices Shows up on time and takes pride in their work Trustworthy as well they completed work in my house while I wasnt always around Would highly recommend and will use again for more projects
5,Great experience Gutters look brand new and all the troublesome leaves are gone They were able to come out same day too Would hire again
5,Ken from rains services is amazing Not only do these people specialize in pressure washing but he is also a handy man Ken helped me put up a closet shelf and curtains They are very responsive and Ken is very knowledgeable when it comes to handy work He comes in prepared to do any job and DOES NOT QUIT OR STOP UNTIL THE JOB IS DONE Even when I had a minor issue he had NO PROBLEM visiting again to make sure I am happy Im so glad I found him and we look forward to continue working with him Welcome to the family Ken And thank you for all you do
5,Ken was absolutely amazing He worked extremely hard and checked with me to make sure I approved of the work Ive never seen someone work as hard as him Wish there were more people like him We are very happy
5,Nasser was absolutely super He did an outstanding job and went above and beyond He definitely has a new permanent customer  Ive already scheduled the next job for a couple days from now Highly recommend Nasser  I definitely recommend this great business Call them You will be so glad you did
5,Very responsive and reasonable The pressure washing and staining of our pier and deck was done professionally and quickly
5,They were reliable and did a great job at a fair price I highly recommend them and plan to use them the next time I need pressure wash services
5,Rain was so helpful and fearless with helping me to change an exterior light fixture and a battery in a smoke detector Seems like a small job but with my high ceilings its kinda dangerous The price was extremely fair he cleaned up the area and Im very happy with his work and he was a pleasure to work with Thanks again
5,He was on time and he did a great job  really happy with my curtain bars Would definitely call him again for future works 5 
4,Rain helped the same day replace a mailbox for my father I was grateful for his quick response His price was very fair The only complaint I had was that was a huge piece of cement from he old mailbox was left behind near the curb We had to pay another contractor to remove it as my sister and I do not live with my 82 year old father
4,I like that they were in top of the communication to ensure service was provided in a prompt manner He actually arrived ahead of time and was able to fix my garage front panel The job was a little messy and he clean it after work I give a four because the wall besides the area got all full of the glue and other material he was using and did not clean it until I ask him to please do it But overall good job Appreciated the service
5,Great service kept me up to date on progress Gutters cleaned and house are power washed Exceptional job
5,Easy quick turnaround for gutter cleaning and a great price

5,Extremely professional did a great job Highly recommended
3,I requested pressure washing for my driveway sidewalk picket fence and patio Id just say make sure you know what youre getting with the quote The scheduler and serviceman were nice but there were a couple things I didnt care for I was told the service person would arrive at 730AM and he didnt arrive until around 9AM and there was no communication at all saying hed be late He only apologized after I asked whether he knew he was supposed to arrive at 730AM Overall he did a good job but a few days later I realized he only did the inside of the fence When I requested a quote I said I had a picket fence and to me requesting pressure washing for a fence would be the whole fence both sides When I contacted the scheduler saying only one side was done she said the service person is not allowed to go into the neighbors yard or on the area where the lake is but he could come back to do that side if I paid 100 more My fence is not shared with a neighbor so there would have been no problem for him to walk around the exterior if he was concerned he could have asked me about that but didnt The scheduler said I didnt tell them I needed a doublesided fence done But isnt every fence doublesided To me when I ask for my fence to be cleaned Im asking for the entire fence The least they could have done was clarify whether I needed one side or both sides of the fence done I also didnt appreciate that the scheduler mentioned it costs them 40 to give me a quote its kind of unprofessional and I wasnt sure if she was trying to use that to make me feel like now I need to use them So they did a good job with what they did in terms of the quality of pressure washing but it definitely wasnt clear about the appointment time or the extent of what they would do Im now the owner of half of a nicely pressure washed fence and thankfully a well pressure washed driveway sidewalk and patio
2,I stated the residence was 3 stories Needed windows and mildew removed from fasciaoverhang Ken did not have proper extension ladder so could not reach mildewed areas my main concern Very disappointed
2,I have a two story building which needed the gutters cleaned I had a few estimates of the exact same amount of 200 so to be fair I picked the first company that gave me that same price The person showed up pretty much on time but with only a step ladder no where tall enough and a leaf blower Ok so we let him use our tall ladder and whatever else was needed   After hours and one incident where he got himself stuck on the roof because the ladder fell over who knows how that happened we were informed that he could not do one side of our house because the roof was too steep he slipped and almost fell off he said and the ladder did not reach Then I was called to ask if I would be ok with him not doing that whole side and I replied that we are paying for the whole house to be done Thats what we were quoted for  Anyway they then sent another person to see what could be done and finished the job Turns out they used their van and put our tall ladder on top of the van and reached the gutters that way Completely unsafe but we didnt realize this until they were just about finished and we checked  Next thing I hear is that they were going to charge an extra 70 because they said our house needs some kind of lift and they took longer than expected Now mind you the first thing you can see driving up to our house is how tall it is on one side If there was an issue the right thing to do would have been to tell me upfront that they could not do the job or couldnt do it as quoted We would have then had a choice to continue or hire someone else but they decided it wasnt s problem and started It didnt become a problem until 34 of the job was done  I argued that I shouldnt have to pay extra because they quoted a price and they could have just declined the job after seeing our house After back and forth I ended up paying 240 as I am not completely unreasonable but I dont feel like I should have been guilted into paying extra especially after the mess they left All other quotes were including bagging up and removal of debris Rains doesnt seem to do that   The kicker though is that they started a case with Thumbtack saying I hadnt paid A WEEK LATER I have proof of payment of course and have sent all the info to Thumbtack  I am attaching some photos of the mess they left on just one side of the house all those leaves came from the gutters If I find the photos of all the leaves they blew onto our pool screen Ill add them but I cant find them at the moment And all the leaves and dirt blown onto our pool deck  Moral here is to make sure they can do the job for the price quoted before they start If you dont they may put you in the position of paying extra because what are you going to do if theyve already done most of the work Also they need to have their own ladders and proper equipment as well as clean up after themselves
1,If it is possible you should pick someone else This company is unable to fulfill its commitment for services agreed upon I secured an initial appointment for Monday and supposedly there was a missing part so it could not be put together without it I was charged 30 for the visit no assembly done When I received the replacement part the company had scheduling issues and sent someone else to get it done but he was unable to figure it out so he left without doing anything but moving a few pieces of the furniture to the top of the bed So now Im out 30 and dont have anything to show for it but this experience Again dont waste your time hiring this person
1,Had two shelves hung Within a month the bottom one fell off the wall while I was in the bed Damaged the shelf and wall I sent Rains Services a message and was blamed for the damages and they proceeded to ignore my messages Had to escalate the situation with Thumbtack to get them to take responsibility for their work They finally reimbursed the 90 cost for the project and 50 to cover broken parts to repair the shelf Each screw was to hold 80lbs There are 3 screws A basket of socks and desk supplies weighing maybe 5 pounds in total ripped the shelf off the wall When you hire a professional you expect them to do quality work and take accountability when the work is subpar I had to threaten a lawsuit to get my money back and will never do business with this company again Be sure to ask about a warranty which for me was only a 24 hour guarantee after they left the job site
5,For sure will recommend them to my friends them deserve the mouth trust
5,Very professional with the work  One of the best  Highly recommend

5,Dan came out and replaced a broken fence we had He got back to me right away and came out to fix the fence when he said he would He did a great job I am going to hire him to fix my walls and counter tops

5,Dave and his brother did a great job painting my home He also fixed a few spots on my wall and recommended doing a few other jobs I highly recommend and will definitely be using his service in the future
5,Our previous contractor someone that we knew through family and friends abandoned our project after receiving 23 of his estimated costs for the project up front  A costly lesson that we will not make again He left our project in a terrible mess and us holding the bag for about 10k worth of work started but not completed  After his abandoning our project I went to the internet to look for a contractor who might be able to finish our disaster It was there that I stumbled across an app called Thumbtack and found Dave and his crew at RTLPhillips inc  Dave brought professionalism and a sense of purpose to our project He gave us vision on the best way that we should proceed to remedy the horrible situation that we had been left in He let us know how he intended to do things and what we might expect He and his great crew then proceeded to quickly and expertly renovate the exterior of our home Daves attention to detail is meticulous The speed with which he and his crew were able to replace every bit of rotten wood on our 70s home his most excellent carpentry work in doing so his design and paint color selection advice and brother Pauls paint job one the finest Ive witnessed ever made working with RTLPhillips inc a real pleasure Thank you so much Dave and crew You saved us from our disaster We will of course call you first for our future projects and now wish to give you our most heartfelt thanks for everything and highest recommendation possible to you and your company

5,Selling a house and Dave was quick to come out and take a look at what needed repairs and recommend what should be done right away and what we should perhaps wait for the inspection to take care of Him and his crew did a great job and got it done 2 days after we originally met
5,RTL contracting did an excellent job giving our 1990 built home a complete face lift We hired RTL to paint our home and modernize our round columns to square and install new out door perimeter lighting Dave and his team were very responsive and provided a day by day update on the process and the next steps in the 2 week renovation The project was completed on time with beautiful results RTL contracting is not cheap but you pay for what you get I will definitely hire Dave for my future home renovation needs
5,Dave and his crew did an awesome job on my bathroom From rebuilding walls behind the old shower to flooring and painting Dave listened to what I wanted and made suggestions The end result is that I am thrilled with the bathroom and the price was right
5,FANTASTIC JOB These guys are the real deal Professional thorough and efficient I would recommend them to anyone everyone
5,They did a great job repairing stucco cracks and repainting my entire house Its apparent they know what theyre doing Also appreciated the fact that they showed up on time and kept me in the loop if they couldnt make it had to work around rainstorms which is understandable Would definitely hire again
5,Dave and his brothers did an amazing job They are really nice guys and you can tell they know their stuff We had a patio ceiling to be replaced and I had others who either proposed panels which would sag or didnt give me confidence they wouldnt shoot holes into the attic Dave clearly knew what he was doing and the job was done topnotch beautiful His rate was higher than the others but for specialty projects like this one I would highly recommend him You could tell he and his brothers cared about the work which meant a lot and reassured us it would be spectacular

4,Was fast to respond and came out to my home and completed the wall in one day All of his guys were professional and the wall looked fantastic when completed I was offered lower pricing after the job was completed by other contractors so compare pricing before you hire them to make sure its competitive
4,I had asked for pressure washing on my deck and the front of the house was added to the ticket at my request The deck is still pretty dirty but I asked them not to have the washer so high that it took the paint off so they used a lower pressure that really didnt fully clean it But is is not their fault it is what I requested So they did what I asked and completed the job in a timely manner
4,Dave  Paul did work in our master bedroom removing the ceiling tiles that were there and redoing the drywall They added a coffered ceiling which is beautiful We love our new ceiling Only thing keeping them from a 5star rating is the amount of dust cleanup we had to do after the job

2,Not really happy with the amount of money I paid and the haphazard attitude about the mess I had to clean up with the stained tiles from the grout It literally took hours to clean each tile or the wrong electrical outlet put in or the paint job which still has touch ups needed Or the floor that was left filthy after grouting and I was told to clean it Or a problem area that needed tiling was ignored or lay a wall across from my bathroom has speckles of paint chipped off Especially as I paid yes 1000 a day
4,David was very nice and worked with us to get exactly what we wanted done We had a wall added in our home with an added AC vent He framed in antique doors that we purchased He was a great value for our money and really worked with us and within our budget He went out of his way to help us An area of improvement would be punctuality but he did work within a short time frame because the wall was for a nursery We would work with David again and recommend his work Our wall and doors look amazing

4,Let me start off by saying this company responsive and extremely kind people work there I get responses within minutes They matched a quote I received from someone else to mount my two TVs and and attempted to mount my headboard to my wall   This company has great reviews I think my project may have been more than what the technician can handle I had instructions the I provided the tech with but for some reason he refused to use them My bed cane with 3 panels to be hung and take perfect measurements and attention to great detail I stayed with him during intial setup and continued to referencing him to the instruction manual because he kept trying to figure it own his own or do it his own way It took about 4 hours to install I had to leave to work in which I went upstairs to check before hand From a quick glance it appeared to be fine My mother called me when she arrive and said one of the panels were uneven When I returned home I took a better look and realized it was all wrong One panel bracket was coming off the wall causing it to lean forward The other panel he stuffed with something because the panel was not hanging on the bracket due to incorrect measurements The last panel I guess he gave up lol and the bracket was completely crooked and unleveled I went to sleep with pillow surrounded my head Incase one fell so it would break the fall  I sent a message to the company with photos which they immediately responded and they wanted to send the
5,The technician was very professional Extremely polite and competent His work was impeccable Very kind gentleman as well He cleaned up afterwards completely I highly recommend him I was extremely pleased

1,Installation of blinds did not work they would not roll up or down due to placement When troubleshooting and trying to make them operate at all they fell on my head and sliced my hand open Worse i cannot even replace them bc the tech took the receipt
5,Pirooz did a great jobhe was thorough careful and a pleasure to deal with We would definitely use him again
1,The tech said I had to buy a new bigger tv to be able to not see the bracket when the tv is up against the wall After he left I read the manual and learned the bracket can be lowered He agree to come back to fix it I called and texted a few times to follow up but he did not reply Then I reached out to FixTman and a follow up visit was scheduled He did not show up Another appt was scheduled He did not show up I then requested a refund and FixTman said he would give it to me When I finally spoke to him he insisted he come back and said he didnt have the power to give me my money back I said ok One last try He came This time he said the tv was not heavy enough for the bracket I found this to be a ridiculous excuse I told him that made no sense The bracket is designed for the size tv I have and he is the one who said the bracket was the right one Anyway he left and came back with another bracket Finally the job was done right I get mistakes happen but the excuses are not acceptable Did he really believe that I would accept the tv is not heavy enough He is nice enough when he shows up but the entire experience was horrible
1,We had the work done by FixTman Inc reviewed the results were that your work was a fire hazard We had to pay another  20000 to fix the improper wiring
1,I would give zero stars if I could Confirmed appointment for 11 am 2pm and then cancelled at 157pm Super unprofessional This is the second time a technician from their company canceled on an appointment last minute Do NOT hire

1,This is horrible company do not do business with them they have me waited two consecutive days no one ever showed very unprofessional stay away from them they will waste your time
1,Typical bate and switch scammer When I clicked to hire these clowns the price was 75 an hour which is what they advertised on Thumbtack Then they contacted me and told me 90 and tried to hack up the price They are u professional and call from weird phone numbers Be very weary of this company as they are not honorable
5,Wonderful experience with Pirooz Personable punctual and great attention to detail Would definitely recommend
1,We all have busy lives So when you get rescheduled on TWICE it does more than just upset you This company rescheduled my service two days in a row After I hired a babysitter for both days Now Im out  and my housework still isnt complete Total waste of time
1,The technician was very slow I had 2 small ikea drawers assembled and he took double the time as the last person who assembled the same model for me When he said the drawers were done there was a 2 inch gap in one of them that I had him fix Then he told me because he had another job to get to and because it took so long he couldnt assemble the third piece he was scheduled to assemble This is unacceptable I booked this appointment for 3 pieces and only 2 were assembled I would have hired someone else if I knew the job wouldnt have been completed Horrible customer service
5,Great attitude Definitely will pick Him again Thank you

4,UPDATE I am updating my review to 4 stars After seeing my review the company reached out to me to explain the situation I had with the amount of time it took to complete the job Customer service rep was really responsive and listened to me as I explained the issue I really felt that they were willing to do whatever it takes to make a customer happy   ORIGINAL REVIEW The technician assemble the desk well but they sent one person to assemble a six drawer cabinet at 5pm It took five and a half hours to finish The guy was here until 1030pm and would not take a hint Really needed to send more people or give me an idea of time It was an extremely slow process Then upon finishing immediately started bugging me for a review they did a good job assembling everything but I wouldnt use this company again

1,Completely terrible experience The project was not done right and many cancelations
1,This company is totally unorganized I requested service and explained what I needed done clearly via text and pictures One of their workers came to my home and said that he couldnt do it alone and the company called me and told me that they would have to charge extra to hire another person Then they called me and told me that they didnt have anyone with a high enough ladder  Ridiculous and unorganized bit was quick to charge my card before service

2,UPDATE After hearing about my experience Fixtman did everything they could to make things right for me and I really appreciate their efforts They went over an beyond via phone and text to make sure they captured my concerns and they were responsive throughout They didnt stop until I was satisfied and they were very thorough patient and kind to me even though I was visibly upset and that speaks to their professionalism and commitment to customer service The experience I had with them rectifying my concern is the reason why I will return again Thank you Charles for being super patient and really trying to make things right which Fixtman did    Horrible Just horrible Ali was the worse I worked with this company about 3 weeks ago and they did a great job with my bed and barstools so I came back again for a couch and desk and I wish I didnt do it Lesson learned Ali left in the middle of a job and even left not only the trash of the desk with nails on the floor and the unfinished couch but apparently while I was in work meetings he found my snacks and drinks too and helped himself and left that on the floor before he left I didnt see that part of it until he left and I am pissed and furious Disgusting Will never use their service and to think I tipped him 40 bucks for their last job

2,I would not recommend Agile movers Im not trying to be rude but they took a long time to eat up time so that I had to pay for an extra hour after asking them to decrease the amount of workers so that it was more affordable and they also broke stuff
5,Great job got here a bit early and finished it quick and exactly what I wanted Removal of all fixtures
2,Firstly I want to commend the excellent response rate and communication from the Admin side They were quick to also fix a job badly done  I had Adam come home a do a few things around the home   He was keen on finishing the job as soon as possible and not necessarily on doing a clean and a professional job  For example He installed 2 toilet paper holders for us  Both of them came right off within the first day of use   When he installed them He went on to cover the holes of the older ones I could have done as bad a job as he did   When they came off He came back and drilled another set of holes and reinstalled the holder This time he left the previous holes he made completely untouched    The third time he came back in He did not seem to think what was quiet obvious to the naked eye that it was an ugly job   He had to be told firmly that the expectation was quiet simply that it looked like a professional did it    I do not recommend him  Otherwise the admin is great and they are effective
5,On time Worked diligent toward the goal Professional
2,Nice person but wasnt able to install the safety baby gate well in front of my staircase I have to find someone to fix it properly
5,This was the best experience I have ever had with a move
5,On time Job was complete as asked Very happy with this choice
5,The mover was fast friendly and ultra experienced He was very professional and his work was high quality
3,Pro was very responsive but very unprofessional and overpriced I had a simple platform bed assembly in which his price was 50hr with a minimum of 2 hr or if the job was 1hr the price was 75 plus a 25 travel fee Sidebar Wayfair was only charging 80 but I would have had to wait until the following week When I inquired about the travel fee heshe responded with Look As if to say listen mam this is the price Needless to say I respectfully declined his service and found another pro that was willing to come to me the same day and complete the job for 65 and no travel fee
5,He was great He knew what he was doing Fast and polite
5,Super Quick He took everything off the uhual  assembled my bed in less than a hour Thank you so much
1,This guy came in at 830 and rushed through the whole assembly He left a whole mess in my house and didnt even offer to clean up By the time he left i saw my walls chipped where he brought the furniture and my room walls scratched where he assembled the furniture This is the mist horrible service you could ever get Honestly t
5,Everything was terrific Installer was polite professional and did a great job
5,The packing was really fast and they were helpful in sorting items as well
5,Awesome service Fast and efficient Highly recommend
2,Pros   They pack my up my stuff quickly in the Uhaul boxes I provided  They moved systematically from one room to the next   They wrapped fragile stuff well   they worked for almost 8 hours straight   Cons   Skimped on tape on boxes even though I supplied plenty for them Especially poor on picture frame boxes I had to retape all of them   Did not add crushed paper to fill to top off contents which caused some boxes to collapse when stacked   missed one kitchen drawer   they did not schedule a lunch break so I bought them lunch and forced them to take a break  After opening some of the picture boxes found damage to one of my valuable oil paintings and a max of 2 painting per box I had also insisted they put adding between paintings and they did not One box had 2 framed oil paintings and 4 framed prints stack in the same narrow UHaul picture box with no padding

1,Update 152022  The business owner reached out to me and told me it was my fault that the frames are crooked He said the contractor Miguel offered to fix it but I declined I explained to the owner multiple times that I told Miguel I DO NOT WANT MORE HOLES DRILLED   Instead of Miguel saying I can fix it without drilling holes and I can use a shimmy he decided to be LAZY and say ok I had ZERO knowledge that it could be fixed without additional holes So now it is MY fault that my frames are crooked   Although I did not use this service for the full two hours I still paid the amount got Miguel coffee AND tipped him bc it was the right thing to do to tip someone for their service   The owner promised he would send someone over to adjust the frames and never responded back to me about setting a date But when I first inquired about their services MAN they responded REAL quick less than five mins I wrote a message telling them to please do the RIGHT thing and he went off on me So GHETTO UNPROFESSIONAL LAZY money hungry bunch of people Its my fault that your contractor doesnt know how to measure OKAY   You guys can read our messages I was not rude AT ALL in my message asking them to do the right thing But we all know how men can be with their sensitive little egos Got all upset bc he was told the job was not done well  Original post It was ok They responded immediately came on time I wanted six photo frames hung up Two rows of 3 Theyre not straight He offered to fix it but theres no point If you move it then youll see the hole that was already drilled I dont have plaster to seal it up Couldve done better measuring and marking before drilling

5,I would use this company in the future for all
5,Super responsive via Thumbtack Showed up on time fixed the issue with my fridge in about an hour and offered to come back for free if the fridge acted up again Work was reimbursed under my extended warranty with Costco All In all couldnt be happier
5,Our Tech George was very punctual and texted his ETA A very pleasant young man He diagnosed our problem on the Ice Makerwater intake valve was rusted out but needed to come back a couple of days later to replace the part I got a call the following day to schedule an appointment for part install Again punctual and tidy We also needed a new water filter so he picked one up and brought it back later in the day The visit was pricey but what isnt nowadays and now have the refer working properly and hopefully for years to come
5,Our technician Vitaly and his partner were on time diagnosed our problem and clearly explained our options The work was completed within the time frame they quoted   I have nothing but positive comments I would definitely use this service again and highly recommend them Thanks
5,George was very knowledgeable of the problem conducted all tests found the right part and resolved the issue Brilliant work
5,Alex was meticulous and did a great job
5,Was able to diagnose and
5,I had standing water in my dishwasher I did the diy part but he checked it again and everything was working fine It was reassuring that everything Well worth the 79 to make sure it worked
5,Our fridge went out and they came out the next day to access the problem We needed a compressor and new ice maker they had the parts and fixed it It was quite a job and they really put some time into the job All in all we feel it was a good value The compressor was an upgrade to the inferior stock one and now our fridge runs like new
5,Technician was professional and was very fast at
5,George was fantastic Very professional thorough and knowledgeable with getting after our refrigerator problem Had it fixed in a little bit over an hours time He even ran a little diagnostic check on how things were working He ensured me that the work was guaranteed for 45 days  Ill certainly call him again and recommend him to others
5,Absolutely nicest and best
5,Our freezer was out He came ASAP He was very knowledgeable friendly answered all my questions and was very efficient His cost was very reasonable and definitely worth it He saved us lots of money by fixing it rather than having to buy a new one
5,Tech was on time and finished refrigerator
5,Alex was prompt and got the job done He diagnosed the issue and replaced the damaged part What a relief to not have to buy a new dishwasher
5,When everyone else in town was booked up two weeks I got a professional in my home in 2 days When having a refrigerator down its extremely important to get it back up and running soon I was very impressed with the prompt service
5,The young man arrived on time and fixed my refrigerator in less than a half an hour and with in four hours it was cold again inside The company is in Portland and he had a 45 minute drive
5,Excellent Plus Quick response and had the needed
4,He wasnt real personablelanguage barrier but fixed band aid our stuff We got a major issue but he gave us some more tine with it He was honest and said it wont last but I was willing to take a chance on a couple hundred verses replacmrnt Id use them again for sure
5,I had hired someone else to fix my dishwasher and they could not figure out the issue These guys figured it out and fixed it Very quick response Would recommend
5,Very thorough and professional Excellent communication
5,it is the second time I have used the and they have been great
5,Technician came out the first time and we decided to go with original parts as piecing together parts from Home Depot was not the best route They returned after I received the parts and had them installed in no time I would recommend this company
5,Alexi was very competent diagnosed the problem  completed the work in a timely fashion
4,Very knowledgeable about the service More expensive than I had anticipated with no additional supplies needed but my problem was solved and the tech did show me how to address this issue in the future
5,Called and got an appointment same day and even had the compressor for our LG fridge in stock and in the truck Cant ask for anything better than a same day fix
5,Knowledgeable and ethical he was not looking to price gouge which is one of the most important things you want when someone comes to fix something in your home you do not know about Will definitely hire these guys next time I need similar help
3,HVAC was on time I did have a hard time understanding the technician as he had a heavy accent However they diagnosed the issue and provided a timely bill
4,The service tech was friendly and worked hard However they couldnt source the defective part for replacement and I was left with 82 diagnostic fee and nothing was changedfixed Side note I soldered on the LED SMD myself and fixed the light which they quoted 130 that they couldnt get The temperature sensor 150 was not replaced
5,Quite pleased with this companies service Quick easy on time to spot and happy with my fee   Bill Luettgerodt Lake Oswego
4,expected arrival 2 to 4pmhe arrived at 345  Problem was a simple compressor tube cleaning that took no more than one hourhe charged 250 which is much too high  Alex the service provider was thorough and efficient in analyzing the problem and correcting it and cleaning p after the service
5,Guys did a great job replacing frozen stuck ice master on my Samsung refrigerator
5,Called on Mondayassessed problemnew part installed on Wednesday Great company
5,Quick response gathered info before visit to have the correct part ready
2,I would give them high marks for the speed of scheduling someone to come out and the techs were on time both visits But the language barrier was so significant that I wouldnt recommend them Our dryer was squeaking pretty loudly and after looking at it they said it needed a new motor I asked if they felt with the age of the dryer it was worth fixing They both looked blankly at me and replied I just needed to make decision So we proceeded After the
5,Very nice good work Definitely would recommend to anyone in need of
5,Wow thank you so much for fixing our dryer on a Saturday We had wet clothes in there and were so worried about the dryer and it overheating Thankful you were able to fix it for us very quickly 
4,Didnt like that he charged an extra amount to use a credit card The better approach would be to charge the full amount upfront and give discount if one uses cash I felt that he was scamming me even though that might be the agencys actual policy
5,Very quick from time of booking on thumbtack to completion of project for my dryer Definitely would use Them in the future
5,Absolutely fantastic I contacted them on a Sunday and received an immediate response they could come on Monday and they were right on time Fast professional service they will be my go to guys from now on
4,This pro came on time and did the work correctly but it was fa more expensive than I figured I didnt ask for a senior discount but I wish I had
5,Contact them on Friday afternoon and they came and fixed my dishwasher on Saturday What else do you need
5,my dishwasher was
5,Quick and good Cant ask for more when your fridge is dead 
4,The tech was nice on time and fixed the dryer quickly 4 stars because the cost was astronomical 130 for 30 part and 200 labor for a 45 minute visit
3,The repairman was very nice and considerate but I think it would be good to send somebody with at least rudimentary English
4,This is the second time I have submitted a written response to your inquiry
5,On time and did not try to fix something that was not broken
5,Had some scheduling issues but the technician that arrived was friendly and performed the service requested
5,The service tech was extremely knowledgeable friendly polite well spoken and discovered the problen rather quickly
5,They were quick to schedule showed up on time and were very thorough
5,He was very nice and explained exactly what was going on in my fridge Finished promptly
3,2 guys showed up at my house They moved the refrigerator out and started doing diagnostics Although they were having a discussion they were not speaking english so I have no way of knowing if they were discussing the results they were seeing or something else Then when they were done with the diagnostics I was informed that I needed a compressor They replaced the compressor at considerable cost and gave me a 30 day warranty I had to write a check because they did not want to pay the credit service charges It has only been 12 days and now I am getting noises from the refrigerator When I contacted them I was told that it was probably something else and a technician would have to diagnose it I am going to contact another company and have it looked at as I do not feel comfortable with doing business further with these guys It may be unrelated but I have a very uncomfortable feeling about it
5,The refrigerator and even the ice maker work well again
2,They will not answer questions that the warranty service requires
5,Same day service excellent work quality and fair pricing Would use again
5,Ill be able to give you a rating after an appointment Thank you Jerold Walden

5,Terrific job on floors that take a lot of abuse in an industrial work place Floors look new after decades of neglect

1,Horrible company Expect dishonesty Its about the  My compressor has an industry standard of a 10 year warranty They wanted to upsell me on their compressor to the tune of 1200 not disclosing the warranty on my unit I discovered the warranty at Home Depot and confirmed with LG So they would have profited off of the extra 400 I would have paid then turned back on the manufacturer and received a new compressor for FREE I will be disputing my charge He also damaged my Brazilian Cherry floors I may need to go after them for that as well

5,Got help the day after I called and the
2,Didnt feel
2,Nice guy but unfortunately misdiagnosed the problem and provided no solution It appeared to me he needed more assistance from a peer on the phone than expected to figure out the problem
5,Responsive Got the estimate and advise on the
5,Responded quickly to my request to
5,Highly recommend this company The appointment was easy to make the technician showed up within the window he diagnosed the problem pretty quickly  helped unloadload the refrigerator The followup appointment went similarly well had to wait a couple of days for the piece to come in and the payment was seamless Thanks for a great job

5,Fast quick and efficient work for a minor fridge
5,Got my oven back up and running quickly Will call them again if another
5,Very professional and experienced stayed until the job was done and went the extra mile to made sure there was not any other issues
2,Poor communication and a misdiagnosis of my washing machine Incorrect parts ordered due to the misdiagnosed problem and incurred costs associated Would not recommend
1,Horrible service Gave them a chance twice thinking its human to make mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance The same technician named Andrew Bichukov was sent to my place twice Once to
5,I appreciated his explanation of the
1,Worst experience ever So this is about the 5th person Ive hired off this app and they all went well until today I have an air duct that came out of my fridge and I just needed it to be put back in This guy first tells me it doesnt go to my fridge Then he asks why I want it put back in Then he told me you dont call a repairman and tell him what to do Rudest guy Ive ever worked with in my life
5,Dimiti was great Thank you so much Was quick help diagnose and solved the problem and offer to help if need be in the future
5,Very good tech On time came back with part on schedule  Also fixed our washing machine for the hourly fee but no additional service charge Keeping them in my contacts for future needs
5,Was quick to respond Was able to diagnose the problem and quickly fixed it
5,I needed my dryer fixed before the holiday weekend and they made it happen Fast efficient and friendly Thank you so much
5,They came out same day to look at my dryer had the parts and had it up and running in no time
1,Well where do I start and keep this under five pages long First of all I wish I could give them zero Stars it was about a four month or more process they diagnosed my dishwasher of having a bad pump when they took the dishwasher apart they said the water pump was not broken but they put a new one in anyway that did not fix it then they told me that the pump fried the control panel I said okay about the control panel water pump and control panel now Im into it for 500 they replace the control panel that did not fix it they tried one more thing they did not tell me what it was they replaced it for free that did not fix it I told him I wanted my money back this has been such a joke and a huge waste of my timeI finally got all of my money back so I went through all this trouble and my dishwasher is the same as it was before I started these people dont know what theyre doing they were looking up on YouTube how to fix it while they were at my house I would suggest nobody call these people
1,I had thought this was like a professionalcommercial type of business but I guess its more of a local handy mans personal business  In the first 5 minutes of him arriving he had told me that I needed to replace the whole control board before even really touching the machine So I was getting ready to pay him for his assessment so he could be on his way and I could just go find someone else to do the job But then he tells me he wants to make sure and spends another hour and 15 minutes going inside the washer and then comes up with the same need to replace the control board It seemed like he needed to watch some videos or talk to somebody else about it first Then at the end says it will be 210 to replace the control board plus partsidk if he wash just killing time down there to make the 70assessment worth it or something But I definitely will not be calling this company back He was a kind man not rude or anything just didnt seem like he knew what was going on and just wanted me to choose the most expensive option when we are pretty sure thats not the problem Pretty disappointed
5,Dimitri was very good No problems Took the time to explain answers when I asked questions
5,I am thankful to Solo
1,Show up when they say they will on time and do a good job
1,The first time we hired them for a dishwasher leakage
5,Very good except had to come back to turn on the water
5,Really liked Andrew
3,The tech that showed up was very knowledgeable and professional A plugged freezer drain that took 1 hour to
5,Great experience Work was done quickly and professionally Our washer is back up and running
5,He did great and quick work Very reasonable price
5,Very thorough and professional
5,Quick response on time and fixed Easy to pay with phone app
4,Dimitry responded quickly came when he stated did a good job finding out what was wrong and then fixed it ITs working great but Im waiting for my invoice so I have a record of what was fixed
5,Did a great job was very happy with the service
1,Mansplained to the end No respect for women Criticized our nutrition from items in our fridge unbelievably unprofessional Will never use this company again
1,Absolute scam artist Do not use this company
5,Our technician was straightforward and got our gas stove and range up and running Thank you
2,The worker was mad we had a warteen
5,They had responded the next day went right to the problem  resolve it

4,Well done
5,Was very responsive arrived right on time for appointment
5,Very fast service efficient and thorough Would hire them again
5,Same day
5,He did a great job of informing us about what was wrong and how to get a hold of LG to have it fixed under warranty
5,Such a great experience Easy and fast to schedule great value Kind and explained everything
3,Showed up Found ice in ice maker tray Decided nothing wrong Checked freezer temp Decided nothing wrong Charged service fee 79 Said if problem not really fixed then he will return no new fee Still no new ice after 4 days Rescheduled for Friday 7August2020
5,Vitaly and Dmitry were both highly skilled and personable
2,The communication was not good from the beginning The person was late they apologized for being late when I checked if they were going to come and I had to ask many questions to understand that they agree with my diagnosis of the dishwasher and to understand what the next steps were going to be They charged me 79 for the consultation before telling me what the problem was They were supposed to call me the next day but I had to call them at 3pm to see if they were still looking for the piece to
1,The reason I leave a 1 star rating is the diagnostic they provide did not solve the problem They did not spend time to reply or correct their wrong diagnostics The issue was dishwasher not cleaning properly the dishes They said the garbage disposal is problem your dishwasher is perfectly fine I changed the garbage disposal but still the same issue continues So their diagnostic was wrong If there were a different root cause they did not spend time or effort to check I could use my money more wisely rather then employing this team
5,Extremely pleased with Vitaly and the work he did on our washing machine
2,Oven was fixed but very unprofessional Insisted we paid by Venmo questioned when we wanted the number and Info for the office Office would accepted a credit card and when we didnt want to pay by venmo technician threatened to undo his work Very odd interaction
1,They took all my personal details and told me they couldnt find parts for my
1,This service was just completed and I am incredibly disappointed with the entire interaction While the job was done and the
4,Got my fridge up and running in about an hour It was worth the overnight wait to get it done
2,They were very responsive at the start but then would not allow me to talk to the actual technician after the initial assessment They had me pay via Venmo which was very sketchy and then couldnt schedule the work until a week later after ordering the part Then less than 12 hours before the appointment they texted me to say the technician wouldnt be available and asked if I could reschedule for 8 hours later I refused because this was for a rental and my tenants already made arrangements with their work and the technician showed up at the time originally discussed Once the work was done while I was in a work meeting I received 2 phone calls and a text message asking for payment The most responsive they were was for my initial call and for their payment I would not use this company again due to the lack of professionalism and refusal to allow me to talk to the technician and then paying via a Venmo account
2,They could diagnose the problem but werent professional in following up Upon multiple attempt they told part is no longer manufacturered They could have done a better job in letting the customer know the detailsupdates
5,Was very professional and helpful
5,Very satisfied with technician thoroughness  quality
2,The appointment was between zero 8 AM and 10 and a professional texted me a few different times and kept saying he would be later and did not show up until 115 PM

1,Washer broke and I called these guys They fixed it for 279 It broke again a little over a month later and theyre charging me another 279 because theyre warranty is only for 30 days I could of bought another washer at this point
4,Did a good job Works great now
3,A bit frustrating trying to get through to the company there was a language barrier that led to some misunderstandings
3,Unfortunately he did not solve the problem Cleaned out the ice and left the area very clean
1,He was late to every appointment rescheduled most appointments After he was two hours late to the final appointment I fired him
