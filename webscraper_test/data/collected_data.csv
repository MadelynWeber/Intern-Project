5,"They did a great job. They rebuilt my closet, hung curtain rods, fixed a kitchen cabinet and drawers as well as a few other small projects. It was very reasonably priced and done quickly. I would definitely hire again."
1,Very poorly. Owner shows up and says his worker was going to be late. I didn’t want to wait and he says he would go get the worker. They never came back.
5,Al & A.J. are two of the nicest & hardest workers I have ever hired. Will use them again!
5,C and H performed their tasks in an excellent manner very professional they did great work. I really recommend C and H for jobs around the house.
5,"Al and his team have been fantastic in both service and workmanship. We needed a shower replaced in our rental home. He not only provided a number of options, but recommended ways to save money as well. The work project itself, Al made sure if there were any concerns we had, he addressed it promptly. We plan to use C&H for a number of other smaller handyman projects we need done both immediately a...

5,"Absolutely outstanding -- your search for a handyperson is over. The team arrived always promptly, did outstanding work, and were extremely kind. They always had professional, creative, and sound solutions to our variety of tasks we needed, and did a great job describing their rationale. Prices were great. We will absolutely have them again for any further work....don't hesitate to work with them."
5,"Al was prompt, and he and his worker, did a nice job. Another party suggested pulling up part of a cement walkway, and this route was not so major."
5,Great! No issues. Small job. They offer other services as well.
5,Showed up on time and completed all requested work professionally and quickly. Have now signed up for bi-weekly services.
5,The installation was done in a timely manner and done well.
5,"The job foreman and cleaning person, Rosa, arrived at the advised time. We went over the work to be done. After all the details were worked out, Rosa went to work. The results met my expectations. All interactions were professional. The work was completed on time. I would definitely use C&H’s services again."
5,The whole experience was great! The team members are extremely professional and we are thankful they showed up to help us.
5,"My relative has been living in the same condo for over 50 years and finally agreed to have the junk acquired hauled away. During this process mold was found in a bedroom and kitchen wall.

5,This was my first general cleaning after my deep cleaning last month. I am very happy with the quality of work performed. A great job. I will be setting up future monthly cleaning with C&H.
5,"Al and his crew do an outstanding job! We have used them for both housecleaning and handyman services. Highly recommend. They have done a spring/deep cleaning which made the house look sparkly clean again, as well well as bi weekly cleaning to keep it maintained. In additon, we needed two doors replaced and they were able to handle this in just a few hours and at a reasonable price."
5,"When I moved into my house I was disappointed in the condition it was in. I had Al come and provide a estimate to get it cleaned properly. I was very happy with the work performed. Everything that was cleaned sparkled when it was completed. The quality was better than I expected. The cleaning crew was friendly. Al came and made sure that all the cleaning we had agreed to was completed. Will be sch...

The screen on the crawl space was an urgent need to keep out unwanted pests and they got it fixed fa...

Al was very responsive when we were setting up the appt and he arrived with Rosa to go over what needed to be done. He also came back at completion and rolled up his sleeves and helped sweep out the garage. Many thanks for your hard work!"
1,"I am not impressed. The cleaners did not wipe away the dust around the fireplace or move a small fridge to clean the hardwood floor underneath. The house was completely empty and we were told the job would last 6-7 hours. When my husband returned home at 6 hours he found the cleaners sitting in the car. When I swiped a finger inside the bathroom drawers they came back dirty. Clearly they had not b...

She was very attentive and gave attention to detail. We will be scheduling with them again! Thank you!"

After 4 hrs. she had finished exactly what we had agreed to. The floors and counters were really clean. We had no complaints. We contacted Al to repeat the service again this month."
4,Very slow. It took her 2-1/2 hour for the master bath only. Then forgot to clean a glass shelf.

We walked through the rooms they'd be cleaning and discussed particular areas of concern in each (oven, fridge, hard water stains on faucets, etc.).

2,"While the actual work done by the provider was initially more than satisfactory, there are some details that force me to write a negative review. The man who did the cleaning arrived quite late because he had been given the wrong street name by the company. Apparently this forced him to rush through the cleaning in order to make his next scheduled appointment on time. He did an excellent job of cl...

5,"Pablo and Maria come every 2 weeks, and we love it when they do. The house is so clean after they come. They arrive exactly when they say they will. They bring all their tools and cleaners and special tricks with them. In 2-4 hours, the 2 of them work so hard and clean the house so well, it sparkles when they are done. Pablo and Maria are a great team and they are very pleasant while they are here...

5,"We live in a large home with multiple living spaces, and have been using Jared's cleaning service for several months. Our main goto person is Ashley, and she has been great! She is very efficient, and our house is always super-clean after she is done. She is also a great communicator and always gets in touch and communicates any schedule or other changes related to the cleaning in advance. We real...

5,They did an excellent job. I was very happy with the team that came out and the work done by all of them. Their pricing is very fair and I plan on using them on a regular basis.
5,"Dominique does a terrific job. Bathrooms and kitchen sparkle and the rest of my place is dust & dirt free. When I request a change, she is always willing to work with me. I couldn't be more pleased. She's usually on time and if she is going to be delayed she always calls and let's me know. She is a jewel."
5,"This is my third time using their service. Ray is great. My house isn't a disaster, but he makes everything sparkle. My faucets are shiny, Stains left by a contractor when installing two sinks were removed by him today. I'm happy. I am happy not to have to clean the hardwood floors anymore. The owners are very responsive and the price is fair."
5,"Arrived on time. brought all needed supplies including a steam mop for tile floors which really was different from any other cleaning service I have hired before. It made the house feel alot cleaner. also, got cobwebs from high places. went above and beyond what one just sees. Monique was excellent."
5,"AMAZING!! I was TOTALLY stressing my home going on the market and having a bunch of ""handyman"" things to get done and Krisitna and Jareds Service came to my RESCUE. they sent over Ray who seriously knocked it out of the park. I had several challenging projects and Ray took care of all of them and did a great job! This company is the REAL DEAL - professional, very prompt to respond and do QUALITY w...

After in-depth research on Angie's List on a Sunday, I left a message on this company's voice mail asking them to contact me. To my surprise, within an hour Jared returned my call. During my conversation with him, I explained what...

5,"I am extraordinarily pleased with the care put into the cleaning -- it was not slap-dash. The old kitchen and bathrooms sparkle. I am completely satisfied. The price was less than I expected. Everyone I met was pleasant, friendly, and competent -- no whining, no judgements."
5,"Excellent service from Ray! He came early (before 6a) just to accommodate my schedule, and got to work right away, even though it was still dark outside! The tile looks fabulous - better than it has ever looked, and the garden wall is sparkling clean. The company beat the estimate I was given by a competitor, and the work was exceptional. Ray is very personable and professional - I will definitely...

I think he uses his cell phone for his business and therefore it was kind of hard to reach him. I don't think I would use them in future until I call them and remind them of some things that they missed. If they resolve that then I w...

5,"Once they arrived they got right down to business. Did a very thorough cleaning of a house that really needed a deep clean. There was lots of dog hair, dirt & dust everywhere but that didn't deter them. We went through the priorities at the beginning and within 5 minutes they were at it. I do feel they are a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. Other less costly services I've us...

The deep cleaning was so thorough that many things that I didn't know could shine were shining when the deep cleaning was completed.

5,They showed up on time and got right to work and did a great job. We will definitely use them again!
5,I hired them through Angie’s List for housecleaning. It’s Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service. I’m happy with them. The cost is $100 each time. Only one cleaner comes to clean for about 4 hours.
5,It took them a long time but that was because the job warranted That amount of time and the house was a complete mess! I am so gratefull for them staying and cleaning as much as they did I can't wait for them to come back and finish the rest of my house... I have been able to upkeep what they did and when they finish they will need to keep coming back as my home is just too big a job for me!
5,"So far, we are very pleased with the job done by Jared. Our bathtub and shower are the cleanest we have ever seen them. He brings his own cleaning products, which are all natural, and they leave the house smelling very good. However, he respects our requests to use certain products on our new furniture, in keeping with the manufacturers recommendations. He seems knowledgeable about the best produc...

5,"I contacted Jared with confidence after reading the business reviews on Angie's list. I called on a Sunday expecting to leave a voice message and instead I got Jared live. He explained pricing and what to expect. I scheduled my first appointment knowing I would not be home and left a family member in charge. I've yet to meet Jared- only have spoken to him a few times and left a few task lists. My ...

They did all of this in under 6 ho...

5,"This is my second review of this company. I continue to be very pleased with the quality of the work performed. We have a dog and two cats. They shed large amounts of hair on the carpet and furniture. Jared gets all the hair vacuumed off the floors, then vacuums the furniture and kitchen chairs. I am amazed at the amount of hair he is able to pick up with his vacuum. He also does a fantastic job c...

1,"My husband and I tried scheduling consultations. They finally returned our call after several attempts. When they did schedule with us they never showed. At first we figured they were busy. The first returned call when finally called was an apology for not returning due to them being out of town with a wedding. We get that life can get in the way. Then he told us he'd call us back to schedule. Nev...

They completely cleaned an oven that had become quite dirty. Pablo redid the caulking arou...

5,"Oscar and his contractors were prompt, they completed the job to satisfaction and left a clean workspace. They repaired/replaced trim in all of the entryways on my main level. They also installed a storm door to my front door. They were very careful in their work. I would certainly hire them to do more work in my home."
5,Perfect! A dream come true. Installed the side door to the back of house. Now I look out over my yard with joy and admiration. During this change Oscar and his team insulated the entire side of house. OMG the room is so much warmer. Thanks a million! from Arneda B.
5,"Very good quality of work. Great crew, punctual and he was an honest guy."
5,"I had him do a work at my house, and he did a very good job. Very professional and a very nice person to work with. I would totally recommend him and would call him again if I need more work to be done."
5,Perfect! Very professional and precise. Cleaned up and presented the deck I dreamed of. On schedule too. Thanks again
5,"Oscar. Does good work at a reasonable price. He has done small handyman work and large improvements and renovations. Will hire him agai,n."
5,It went very good although I had to wait for the replacement several months due to an erroneous delivery of window. Otherwise the work was excellent!
5,"Very well, especially in bad conditions."
5,Frank was on time and professional. He had the job done in less than an hour. Excellent job well done. Anne went out of her way to remain in contact until my job was scheduled. She provided great and quick service. Thank you so much.
5,"I had a problem on garage sinking at the back, he was able raise the roof a bit and was able to change the board and while doing the replacement of the boards he saw chipmunks nest in side the wall, so he put a reinforced 6 inch wide backboard on the base to keep the chipmunks from coming back. And on the Back Porch, he installed new strom door on and put a new light as well, he also stained the p...

5,He does a good job and I highly recommend him to everybody
1,I requested a quote from them 2 times. There has been absolutely no response. Nothing to indicate that they would or could do the job. If they called today I would not hire them. NO RESPONSE.
1,"Called 3 times, receptionist was very nice, but no one would ever get back to me. They won’t come out to look at a job, you have to email them pictures hoping someone will get back to you. I waited a week and no one ever got back to me."
5,Did everything I need and done it quickly. Reasonable price. They work fast and do a great job. I get the same guy every time. Great with details.
5,We're happy with the service and we've been using them for years now.
5,"Very good. Chris was punctual, friendly and professional ! We will have him back for future projects"
2,Never showed up to estimate or return calls
5,excellent. I had used them for years.
5,They helped me out in a pinch. Husband had a hip replacement and we realized we did not have the proper stair railings to help him go up and down the stairs. They came out quickly and installed the extra railings we needed. Matched the new railings shape to the existing railings and cleaned up afterwards
2,"The initial visit was fine: I had a good vibe that the man who visited to assess the job was knowledgeable and trustworthy. He said he didn't know they were still doing this kind of work but would take it back to the shop and someone would contact me with pricing and timing. After 5 days I recalled the number, spoke to a woman and told her I'd gotten no response. She said she'd contact Mr. Handyma...

5,The person did an excellent job on the walls. You can no longer tell they were separated.
5,"I received a phone call from their office telling me that my handyman was picking up some materials for the job and would be a few minutes late. He was, literally, only a few minutes late. He wasted no time setting up his equipment and immediately went to work. The quality of his work was excellent. Halfway through this project I asked him to do some additional work installing a French Cleat syste...

5,"Mr Handyman was prompt, professional and neat. Jim showed up, assessed the situation and made the necessary repairs and cleaned up. I have 2 more projects and I will not hesitate to contact Mr Handyman in the future."
5,"All of the techs that were sent for the variety of jobs we were having done were very professional, did very good quality work, solved some challenges with our old house that required creative solutions, were very quick to start work, communicated very well throughout the project. We had a great experience with the team and will definitely hire them again for future projects."
5,"Great, on time, very courteous. Hardly knew they were here until they showed me the well finished project."
5,The repair man was on time courteous and professional . The work was completed quickly and properly. He made suggestions that made the project better. He cleaned up afterwards .
5,"Very well. Barbara was a wonderful receptionist and took all my many messages and took all the details down and shared them with the workers. Excellent communication was handled with all involved. Also, James was the worker who came out and he did an excellent job. I was so pleased that he knew immediately that the cupboard doors could be moved up so they would open after a refrigerator had been p...

5,"I am always pleased with their work. Thus, I continue to call them for other small tasks that I cannot do. The communication with Mr. Handyman is very good regarding scheduling, any delays, and desired specifics about how you want the job done (or any needed hardware)."
5,He fixed our patio door that got pushed off its track and showed me what to do if it happened again. Would definitely use them again.
5,Terrific from the price quoting phase to the final installation including providing insurance documentation and W-9.
5,It went well. The technicican showed up in the morning. I let him in. He was done and sent me my bill by noon. The work was well done and clean
5,"Mr. Handyman is an awesome service for so many reasons. I'm sure different people use it for different reasons, but personally, I'm a small business owner who is renovating a house, and it's a lot to manage without help. Prioritizing things like small repairs and assembling furniture is extremely difficult for me, and it's so valuable to have a resource like Mr. Handyman who I know will come to my...

5,"Nice job ! , very pleased . Nick was the installer , very nice , organized , cleaned as worked , and made sure he looked over the area not to leave any debris ."
5,"It went great. They did it while I was at work and I always get a little nervous when I'm not there to clarify any questions the contractors might have. However, they did everything perfectly and I feel they even went above and beyond my request in getting the vinyl siding nailed down and secure."
5,Very quick to come and give estimate and quick to complete the project.
5,It was great. They responded to my inquiry the same day and sent a technician out the following day to quote the project. I accepted the quote on Friday and he did the work on Monday. Jon was polite and worked efficiently and cleaned up after the job was done. The final cost was well within the quoted price.
5,everything was done promptly and under the estimate
5,Its under new management and its even better than it used to be.
5,"In each project, I found Mr. Handyman to be reasonable priced and their technician Jim was very professional. I am pleased with the overall result of each project and would definitely use them again in the future"
5,Good job prompt and took no time at all

2,No work was performed since no one contacted me.
5,"The technician (James) was personable, knowledgeable, and aimed for perfection in his work. All aspects of the job were completed at a high level of quality -- the replacement fascia boards above my front door were especially challenging and were done perfectly. I was also impressed with the speed at which the work was executed. The communications from the home office were also excellent and helpe...

5,Excellent. He was really nice and he did a good job. He put a tarp down. Very good. They did the job the same day they came out to give me an estimate. They were right on time. He was very good. Definitely use again.
4,"The work got done, though it was completed by someone with little experience in these areas. They did come back and fix the problems I noticed, so in the end it was ok."
5,Wonderful! Technician Nick came out and repaired my deck and did an excellent job and was done in 2 hours and it was very affordable
5,"He did some work, a couple of jobs for me, about an year ago. I was fine with him. Two was a little bathroom window. One is a bay window. Three separate windows. They must have misunderstand me, and we got it straighten out. So, they replaced the two windows in the middle, and as they were doing the work outside, they called me outside one day, and wanted to show me something. If I had only had an...

5,They are down in my book as the people I turn to because I've been happy with their services all the time.

5,"very well, they were extremely professional, showed up on time and were done before i knew it. didn't think it would make that much of a difference, but now im almost too hot, so i took my shirt off"

My fencing had some damage and I was worried about my dogs getting out, Mr. Handyman made an appointment promptly and Dan arrived on time and finished quickly.

5,"I am a Dan fan...big time! He works really fast, cleans up, eager to help and do a job right. He seems to ask himself how he could do a job differently to save me money. Dan the Handyman is a great help to me."
2,"Three business days before my scheduled appointment of June 21, 2016 they called and cancelled. Jim from Mr. Handyman gave no reason other than they couldn't do it at this time. I had a door jamb that was broke and the door was not lockable so I pleaded for them to please just do that one for safety. He agreed and sent someone over on June 21, 2106. they had given me an estimate $457.00 and 4 hour...

3,Problem was solved to my satisfaction and raised the grade to a C

The first job entailed replacing wood that h...

They said racial slurs to me concerning hot sauce. The doors to the bathroom and laundry rooms were only painted on one side. The guy was getting angry and felt like I was trying to tell him how to do his job. They were upset that they had ...

5,Very professional and friendly. Performed requested repairs timely and did an excellent job. Work area was immaculate when they left.
5,Installer arrived on time and went right to work. He removed the old door and installed the door I bought at a local box store. He keep the work area clean and took the old door with him. He also filled the gaps in the door frame with insulation. The price didn't seem out of line and I will be calling Mr. Handyman in the future.
5,The workmanship was excellent. No complaints.
5,"I am totally thrilled. I have been unable to open my front door since painting was done over a year ago. Several of my male friends had attempted to open the door, without success. Nick spent less than ten minutes and had the door open. When I commented that he must be really strong, he told me that he worked smart, not strong. He told me even though I had left the door open for twelve hours after...

2,"After I approved the quote for the first property and the work did not start for a week to ten days, I called back and was told that some emails had gotten screwed up and that they were waiting for a part but work would start soon. After another week or so I called back. I gave all my information and was told that the issue would be looked into and someone would get back to me. No one called back ...

He is always professional, cleans up any mess and punctual. We will continue to contact Deitmar whenever we have an odd job - would highly recommend."
1,They came out and basically wrote down everything that I needed to have done which I thought I could have just given them over the phone. The guy that came out said that could not give me an estimate but someone else would reach out within two days with the estimate. I waited over two weeks and have not heard back from them.

1,Mr. Handyman never showed up for his service appointment. Please do not schedule with them.
1,Called twice and left a message twice the week of 5/5/2014. Never got a return phone call.
5,"Misc services. Hanging curtain rods, pictures, shelves. Fix leaking shower."
4,Chose a different contractor based on expedited scheduling requirements.
1,unfortunately I was told he did not provide service on the NE side. Or should I say my home address. Athough the ad states East and West.
5,Very prompt and on time.? Always cleans up.? Does a great job with everything.

1,"Charged me to come and fix the gutter guards that they have installed. Gutter guards have COMPLETELY fallen off. I have called there 5 times, and I get the same response that someone in the office will get back to me, however no one has bothered to call me.

He incorrectly hung up our towel rack (did not use a leveler so it was lopsided and did not ask me where we wanted it to be placed) then started to put together my baby's dresser.

5,"Called for and received estimate. Work was scheduled to be performed at our convenience. Repairman was punctual, knowledgeable and friendly, Price was very fair and work is very good."
5,Overall it was a good experience. I gave a B for price only because i normally do my own work but couldn't reach the vents. I also gave a B for quality only because the individual who performed the work left some screws in the driveway where they were parked.
4,"The caprenter's name was Jim, very nice and knew just what to do. (I had a leaky porch roof and needed some stairs rebuilt) They make the steps at their plant and brought them to the house. All was done in the two days they said they would be."

When Bill (the handyman) showed up the next day he was fairly well prepared on what needed to be done. He cut out one plank (I was afraid more would need to be removed) about 16 inches long and popped in a new one. Bill was very nice and let me watch as he worked. All in all it to...

5,They did a nice job. The young guy showed right up and looked over things and told me how much it would be. Then within a few days a gentlemen showed up and did the painting and everything was good. They were prompt and nice. They got everything finished in one day and didn't mess around. I would definitely call them again for work around the house.
5,Very efficient with call back to review work to be done and provide estimate. Quick scheduling of work and gentleman that performed the work was very friendly and professional and did a great job. Trim looks great.
1,"Came out and looked at our utility room and our small bathroom. We didn’t hear from him for two weeks. Finally, I called for the proposal. I feel he should have called us sooner, also he wanted to charge us $2,000.00 for the work. Which i feel was way over priced for the work."
2,"I had some issues with the work that they did but it got resolved. They completed 90% of how the work should have been completed. I spent a few bucks on them to complete it. It is complete now but there were some hazels with the guy who was running it. Now, everything is complete. They customized some stuff in the kitchen for me but I have an issue with the final work that they did. I spent a week...

He had to do it twice because the first time it was not level . He had a helper with him who did nothing but hand him tools. He charged, what I would say was a considerable amount. Other than charging too much, he ...

5,I had a pull chain previously. They came in and put a new light switch. They were not very expensive and the quality of work was good. I was satisfied with their service.
5,They explained everything to me and the job went very well. I like that I can call them up and they will come out usually within the week. They will accommodate my schedule and have even come on a weekend. I will use them again.

Unfortunately, due to the unplanned shopping trip, he asked that we reschedule having the garage g...

The leak alternatively was supposed to be fixed by the plumber but which wouldn’t. He was pretty damn good. He came and adjusted our schedule. The man he sent was very nice.

I do not think that the price is out of line, and it is worth it to me to get these nagging little things done. In fa...

5,The work was performed in not the best of conditions. The laundry area was crowded and not a lot of room to work. The exhaust vent went into the attic and not easily accessible. Both problems were solved to my satisfaction.
1,never showed for his appointment with us. Never called us.
1,Did not come to my home to give an estimate or call me back after more than two weeks.
5,"it went very well , Jim arrived on time and everything was done quickly and neatly"
3,"I also bought a double lock set so he could replace the locks on the front and back doors. He replaced the back door lock but did not touch the front door lock. When I tried to use the new key on the front door, I had to replace the front door lock myself."

5,"It went very well. This is the third time that I have had work done by Mr. Handyman, and I am always pleased with their work."
5,"EXCELLENT service. Complete professionalism, expert quality workmanship. The gentleman came exactly on time, worked incredibly quickly and treated my home with care and respect. They will be my go to guys for handy work in the future!"

2,"Michael had come out and gave us an estimate. We already had the wood from floors we had done earlier. When Michael looked at the project, he stated the left over wood would be enough to complete the job. He quoted us $1200 for the project and we offered to pay cash for a $100 discount. His carpeter, Jim, showed up two hours late the day of the job. As far as the quality of the work, it was satisf...

5,"He repaired the door problem and installed the closer in a short time. I had to pay a one hour minimum, so I had him move a nightstand and my bed to make wheelchair access easier."
5,"Everything turned out well. The water damage on the ceiling looked great when they were done, and it blended in perfectly. The price is very good, and they are courteous and prompt. Having the debris removed took a little longer than I would have liked, but they were neat otherwise. I was happy with their work and would use them again."
5,"They are fantastic. When I called the company, they said they could do it the next morning because I had to work around a doctor appointment, which was no problem. They were here promptly and were very courteous and friendly. They just took control of everything and got the job done. I loved them, and it looks beautiful."
5,He fixed that and also he did a few other things to finish the hour he was charging us for. He was super and I would recommend him to others.
5,Good job. No supervision needed. Only they wanted a credit card hold -- probably because I was a first time customer.
4,"I was told that the job was relatively small and would probably only take an hour. They could be out the following afternoon. I had to provide the make and color of our vinyl siding. When I got home the following afternoon nothing was done. I waited until Thursday morning and called to see what happened. When the worker picked up the piece of siding he didn't know until he reached the house that t...

5,I was very pleased with their work. They were very professional. They were on time and cleaned up after themselves. i would definitely refer them to other people.
5,"We have had no problems at all, and the project turned out well."
5,"Good experience. I'm an out-of-state landlord, so my tenant called Mr. Handyman based on word of mouth. The person who took the call recommended that we obtain a new disposer rather than buy through them, in order to save some money. That worked out well, and the repair work was painless for my tenant."
5,He did a good job on each and I am thinking of hiring him again.
4,"The owner was fine. The man who came to fix our siding tried to charge us over $200 more than the original quote. I had to tell him what the original quote was and so he called the employee to check if that was correct. It made for an awkward situation. I did pay them a little extra for working hard, but I was still thrown for a loop. Overall, I was pleased with the quality of the work."
5,Jim was great. He works very hard and the quality was excellent.
5,"I spoke to Kathy and she was very good and professional over the phone. They are acceptable and I was very happy to talk to a live person instead of a voice mail. They are there everyday apparently from 9 to 5, and I really like that. I would most definitely call them again if need be."
5,They are very nice and competent. They corrected everything. They have done very neat work. I am very pleased.
4,"It did not take very long to get the wallpaper off. The employee patched the drywall and let this work day overnight. He returned the next day to prime the surface and paint it.

5,He did good work and at a fair price.
1,"IN MY ESTIMATION, MR. HANDYMAN SHOULD NOT HAVE EVEN CONSIDERED CHARGING MORE THAN $40-50, WHEN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WAS ACCOMPLISHED. THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS A REAL SHOCK TO ME SINCE MY EXPERIENCE WITH CONTRACTORS RATED A ON ANGIES LIST HAVE, UP UNTIL TODAY, BEEN EXTREMELY PROFICIENT AND WORTHY OF THEIR EXCELLENT ""A"" RATING. MR. HANDYMAN GETS AN ""F""!"
5,"They were very good & were very prompt with returning phone calls, very professional & did an excellent job of diagnosing the problem & correcting it. I would hire them again in the future."
5,"They were trustworthy, nice, pleasant, professional and did a very good job."
5,It was very good. He just seemed to be very knowledgeable about being a handyman. He gives out a very confident air about him. He was very respectful and polite.
5,"This company was great and I will use them again. They came out in the exact time frame I needed. The worker was very professional, and when I called they gave me some suggestions to help me save money. The final service ended up being less expensive than the quoted price on the phone. Overall this company is very efficient and I would recommend them and use them anytime in the future."
5,"On time, very polite, good job & reasonably priced."
5,"Jim worked hard and professionally the whole time he was here. He had the right tools for the jobs, except on one occasion. I was very pleased with his work. When he was done I finished by painting the posts and caps and they look good."
5,"I hired the Mr. Handymen crew 2 - 3 times while preparing to put our house on the market. They were very responsive, willing to do a variety of jobs, even adding some newly discovered jobs onto their list after they had come to the house. If they didn't have the tools they needed, they ran out to get it. Very easy to work with, fast, and efficient."
5,"Mr. Handyman gives you the option to purchase your own goods. I chose them to purchase and do the work. They charge $130 an hour. It seemed high to me, but since I cannot do the work I was satisfied that it was done in a timely manner."
5,"The technicians were very helpful, courteous and personable. I have used them for larger jobs in the past and would definitely use them again."
3,"I wouldn't hire him for doing my lights again. I just thought that he was too expensive for putting up just Christmas lights. The work was adequate, though."
5,"They were fine! They were able to do the work just fine, and they were very easy to work with. The task was completed before the end of the pre-paid time period."
4,"He charged for one hour, regardless of how long the job took."
5,"They did a great job. Professional, work man like staff. Good office and scheduling support and attention to detail. Flexible to small changes. Any issues that a rose were handled expertly. We are having them quote our kitchen remodel now."
1,"STOP! Beware! Don t let their ad confuse you! Mr. Handyman was hired to install a shower door in a brand new bathroom. While they were on the job we added the tissue holder and towel bar. We contacted Mr. Handyman because the door was leaking. They sent out a tech to assess the problem & sealed where the thought the leak was. Needless to say it was still leaking after use of the shower. This went ...

5,"It went excellent. All the phone calls, setting up, making a list of estimates for me all went great. I could decide which ones I wanted to pick from. I chose them all. His name is Bill Arison."
5,Thankful for their willingness to provide immediate service in an emergency.
5,He does an excellent job. It's $78 for the first hour and $39 for each additional half hour. I will continue to use his services.
5,"The company sent a professional employee to help with some home repairs. The work was done expertly and in a timely fashion. The fellow who did the work was conscientious, he cleaned up after himself and I was comfortable having him in my home. I HIGHLY recommend Mr. Handyman for help with home repairs. I can not say enough good about them!"
5,"All work perfectly, and he never 'cut corners', even after I told him that would be acceptable."
1,"The job was well performed but they charged $80.00/hour which is pretty steep. But to add insult to injury, they charge a $40.00 appointment fee (?). I do not pay such a fee when I schedule a doctor's appointment or make an appointment for car repair. This $40.00 is just plain greed. Angie's List should not honor such businesses that clearly ""rip off"" the customer."
5,They made an appointment to do the work.
4,I didn't the quality of their work. They charge by the hour and the job took longer than it should have. If I would have know they charged by the hour I wouldn't have hired them.
1,Bill came to my house on 9/21 in order to give me an estimate on replacing my fence. As of 10/18 he has not contacted me with the estimate.
4,"I realized the toilet seal was leaking and running down the wall in the garage. I knew Mr. Handyman was expensive, but they were the only ones who could come out within a week. I thought I'd have to have the flooring repaired but was told it wasn't necessary. A few weeks later I noticed a rocking when sitting on the toilet. hey came back out and screwed down both bolts on each side of the toilet."
5,"Brent found that previous owner had added under sink instant hot water heater, using outlet previously occupied by dishwasher. Dishwasher was now hardwired to 'lighting' breaker. Brent came the same day that I called."
5,Jim was here at 9 o'clock on Monday morning when arrived he said that the cost would be around $139.00. Jim repaired the handle on the stove. Jim was very fast and also saved me a lot of money because the final cost was $39.00.
5,"Michael was prompt and helpful, making suggestions that only a real pro would have known. The seller contacted the builder Ryan Homes, who sent a crew to make those repairs, even though the home itself was past the warranted period. I paid Michael for the beautiful writeup of his estimate, great guy to work with! Thanks, Michael!"
5,"I especially liked the technician that came out, he was very professional and knowledgeable. They were very responsive and I got prompt service."
4,"Company was fine. They didn't show up when they were supposed to but, they did come out the second time I called."
3,"They were most responsive. I live out of town, and they would say they did the work, and someone would go look for me and the work wasn't completed."
5,"We were very happy with everything, starting with the phone conversation with the person who makes the appointments. She explained everything in detail. The work was done to our satisfaction and the technician was very professional. We would definitely call Mr. Handyman for future work."
3,"Most of the work the carpenter did was excellent. There seemed to be some sort of communication error between the owner and the carpenter. The entire job was expected to take 1.5 days. It took 2.5. The owner quoted me 1535 for the work. I left a detailed list of what I believed to be part of the quote with a request that someone call me if it deviated from the quote. The carpenter built a detailed...

There were a couple jobs that he said he didn't feel comfortable doing, so they'll be back in a couple days with some one else that can price the jobs. They originally wouldn?t honor the Angie?s List, and I was told by Mr. Fay that they put both coupons on this next bill. I was to...

5,"Service tech Bill Gantz was punctual, well informed, pleasant and definitely qualified for my requirements."

5,"They called to set an appointment for an estimate. They arrived on time and spent time evaluating job and talking with us. We were given a written estimate and told we'd get a call the next day to set time for workman to arrive. The time was set, the workman arrived punctually, and the work was done professionally and to our complete satisfaction. We'd call them again without hesitation."
5,He fixed the problem and did a good job. He was friendly and an overall nice guy.
1,"When I called I got a sales pitch. I let them know what I wanted. They said they do not give estimates, they only come out and do the job. She put me on hold and then said someone would come out the same day to take a look. I waited and waited when finally about 4:30 I received a voiemail saying he wasn't in the area and they would get back to me by the end of the week. I never heard from them."
5,"After trying for weeks to have another handyman come over but never returned calls, I called Mr. Handyman. They were very detailed, gave me all the information up front on pricing and how the appointment would be handled. They even called the day before to confirm the appointment. They were on time, very efficient and only charged for the time they were there. I will definitely call them again for...

Kathy, Office Admin. had left me a confirm/reminder message on previous business day which is always nice to get. Dan looked over job first, set up his sawhorse and tools and got right to work.

2,"He charges $195 for the first hour, including just to come out and take a look. Following that he charges $19.95 per quarter hour. I didn't even have him come out because of his price."
5,"When I called, the service asked all the right questions and took great notes. When Jim arrived he had a print out of virtually everything I had said, so he was very prepared. Jim was on time (actually 10 minutes early), laid down drop cloths, and did some of the more grimy work outside to limit the dirt in my house. Jim also spent the time to really diagnose my problems rather than jumping to the...

5,They were very professional. They were on time and courteous.
5,"I am happy as he was on time and done quick. He arrived before the scheduled time. Labor charge is $78 per hour. I thought it was interesting that as soon as he entered the house, he put plastic covers over his shoes. He was very clean and didn't leave a mess when finished."
5,Service was prompt and efficient. Service tech was very courteous and professional. Price was reasonable & fair.
5,"WE HAD 4 TOTALLY DIFFERENT JOBS ALL SIMPLE, BUT NOT WORTH CALLING AN ELECTRICIAN, PLUMBER OR CARPENTER. MR. HANDYMAN IS A GREAT RESOURCE, WHEN MANY SMALL JOBS ARE NEEDED AND ALL THE WORK WAS DONE IN 2 HOURS."

4,"HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME INVESTIGATING AND PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO IT. HE DISCOVERED IT WAS A VERY MINOR LEAK, BUT THE CONFIGURATION OF THE PLUMBING MADE TOO DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO REPAIR. HE RECOMMENDED A PLUMBER AND DID NOT CHARGE ANYTHING FOR HIS VISIT. I WOULD CONSIDER USING HIM IN THE FUTURE."

5,Great job! Would definitely hire again. Professional nd couteous.
1,"After a brief description of what I needed, the response was ""I don't mean to be rude, but do you want me to take on an 'afro-american project'?"" When I asked him to explain what he meant, he said ""do you want me to do a fix with like rubber-bands and bubble gum"". Enough said. Seems guys like this are less afraid of the light and are crawling out of the woodwork. Must be the Trump effect."
5,He's very honest and I would trust him with anything. I'll put it this way: I'd let him be in my house even if I wasn't here.
5,"Kjell was very busy with other projects but was able to fit us into his schedule. Communication was good, we kept in touch up until the day before he was supposed to come over to do the installation. Day of, he showed up early and got to work right away. The closet kit he installed looks great and was installed faster than I thought! Prices were reasonable, I will be calling him again for future n...

4,"My experience was kind of mixed. My husband actually supervised their visit. He thought they were good and asked them to do more work. I came home and I wasn't happy. The Big Deal was for a set number of hours and my husband wanted them to finish the work so we paid them for extra time. We had a crack in the living room ceiling and whatever he mudded it with, it didn't blend well with the other te...

I will use Full Time Servants again for any of our dry wall needs and would recommend them to ...

He missed a fine detail; I saw a corner of old paint still sticking out and it really should have been removed. I don't know why he missed that. He even went to the store to and from my work site to pick up some paint for me; he did not have to do that, so that's really...

5,Kjell was terrific. I would definitely recommend him and will use him for all of the household repairs that may be needed in the future.
5,Everything was done correctly and in a very timely manner. The fee was more than reasonable.
5,"I had been told by more than one person that porcelain tile was tricky to drill through without cracking, so I decided to hire the work out. I needed the work done asap, and even though Kjell was scheduled up for the week, he was able to accommodate my tight schedule by working the job late in the afternoon. The job took about 45 minutes to complete. He used a hammer drill to make the holes for th...

5,Very pleased all around.
5,He is awesome!!
5,Very good.
3,"The job did not go as anticipated. We had to stay on top of the work, which initially was rather mediocre. We were told that we were too particular, since we wanted the tiles to line up - imagine that!!! Also, anything negative that happened was the customer's fault and not the contractor's. We will never re-hire this contractor or recommend him to any of our friends or associates."
5,"Richard was fantastic. He has excellent communication, work ethic, and quality of work. We are very pleased with the work he did for us and will definitely use him again in the future. It was so nice to have this experience with him after having a bad experience with a previous contractor. I wish we had found Richard sooner. He installed and finished drywall including matching it up with existing ...

5,Extremely well. Richard arrived on time. Was very professional. Completed the work on time. When necessary on design issues he asked me what I wanted or what I had envisioned for the space. My home turned out perhaps even more esthetically appealing than I knew it would. The new door handles and pulls make me very happy and add joy to my time in my kitchen. I would recommend Richard to anyone.

5,"We were looking for someone who could complete a job that another contractor had not finished, and called Richard after seeing a lot of positive reviews. One or two good reviews could be from family or friends, but many of them is usually a good indicator. And that was the case here. He was prompt and punctual, and did excellent work at reasonable prices. Once he was able to start, he worked on ou...

His work was thorough and I was informed of his progress and any additional probl...

They removed it but along the way damaged the sheet rock and said we needed certain areas that were a problem repaired by someone else. We hired Handyman Unlimited and they were incredible.

5,"He did a great job. It was not an easy job as it entailed a lot of little jobs, i.e., plumbing, demolition, reconstruction, wiring and re-wiring, tiling, etc. He did not contract out any job.

I very much appreciate his attention to detail and neatness, as well as his creativity in tackling complicated and involved jobs."
5,GREAT!! Richard evaluated and solved a problem for us. He cleaned up behind himself both times he was here. That is the mark of a good workman.
5,"They painted the entire door and when they were finished, it looks new. I can't say enough about how pleased I am at the work done and the price was very reasonable. Thank you Richard and son!

I wanted ceiling fans and recessed lighting installed, but a couple electricians who came out told me the job was impossible. Finally, I found an electrician who came up with a strategy to install the fans and lighting so that the wiring was all tucked up underneath the ceiling -- no ugly wire mol...

He did this easily and seemed to have the mold...

5,Great. on time. great quality. very professional.
5,Beautiful work; I'm very happy with it. Thank you Richard !!!
5,"Richard is absolutely METICULOUS. He arrived daily at the time he said he would. He laid tarps from our front door all the way to the master bathroom so he could come and go without getting dirt into the house. He removed the tile from our shower and showed us exactly what the problem was that caused the leak and explained what needed to be done to fix it. It was very apparent that he is a master ...

3,We did not get past the initial phone call because he said he was too busy and booked until summer and referred us to his daughter. He really seemed more interested in getting business for his daughter than anything else. We chose not to call her because she is not on Angie's List and we decided to call someone else.
5,"Richard is an absolute professional and joy to work with. He is utmost of meticulous, very detail focused and wants his work to be perfect! Which it is!!!

5,Jenny came out and gave us an estimate for the work and then came back the next day and did the initial work. She returned once the grout had dried to finish the job and it looks great!
5,"Richard called before he came, he was punctual, and he completed the work easily. He clarified what he was going to do before he started. He has worked for me several times over the past five years on both small and large ""punch lists"" and has always been professional.

He then came over when we had a big rain to make sure it was not leaking. He only charged his original fee. Richard goes beyond what you would expect from a repair person. He is very professional. I highly recommend him. Ben Miller"

He went to the property and promptly provided me with a verbal quote of the estimate of his work (via telephone). However, he did not send me a written, detailed listing. While I appreciated his punctual response, I found the quo...

In fact, in many cases he went above and beyond the estimate and did work that was not specified just because he saw that it needed to be done.

5,"Richard came out to look at the job exactly when he said he would and called within the day with the estimate- excellent workmanship, gave helpful suggestions for the design and finished the work quickly knowing that we had a time issue. The ramp was completed in one day. We were thoroughly pleased with the project and would definitely use his company again."
5,"The experience was wonderful. He came out and listened to everything that I was wanting. He gave some really good helpful tips. He listened patiently and was right on time. Everything was wonderful but I hadn't budgeted for the $1,000. I only had budgeted $700 so I am doing a portion of the work myself and then I am definitely going to give him a call back to come and finish up. I really had a lot...

5,Everything went as planned. The job took the estimated time. The labor estimate was very close to final price and I thought it was a fair price. The materials that The Handyman purchased seemed somewhat high. I should have asked for receipts. I would say the work was exceptional. The Handyman pays a lot of attention to detail. I would call him again.
5,"Glad I found Richard. This was a project that I thought I might be able to do myself. I am certainly glad I did not take it on. After Richard tore into the project, we found electrial outlets had to be moved, heating ducts had to be moved and the door opening had to be cut just right. There is no way I could have done it. Richard did a first class job. He did the construction, electrical, pumbing,...

5,They did excellent work. They were very punctual. They were very communicative in regard to what to do and in fixing some of the issues that I had. They were very thorough.
5,"Our house was built in 1963. The new $70 / 70 cfm fan didn't quite fit in the space of the old fan, but the technician was able to modify the space and adapt the duct work. The new fan works just fine, but is a bit noisy. I don't remember if Williamson's offered us the option of a quieter fan. We would have been willing to spend more if one were available."
5,"We have used them for a number of years, and they have always been honest. We would use them again, and we would recommend them."
5,Installed quickly and cleaned up after work. Workers were polite and courteous. Unit was installed as quoted and looked great.
4,"We first visited their office on S Alvernon Way. Then we met them again at a home improvement show. Our decision was based mostly on price. The visit to their Alvernon office was not impressive. The receptionist could not help us with our questions. The sales person was busy on a telephone call in a back room. After a few minutes, we left without being helped. As we were leaving the parking lot to...

5,THEY GO BEYOND WHAT WAS EXPECTED-EVEN CHECKED OUT MY WATER HEATER.
5,They gave me great info on my current system. They didn't try to sell me a new system even though my current one is old. I feel they were honest and straight forward with me. I will definitely work with them again in the future. They were very thorough. Both my family and I use them for all of our needs.
5,Williamson's Heating & Cooling did an all around fantastic job. We had a really big problem with our ceiling and they came out very quickly with no hassle. The high quality or their work made us very happy and we highly recommend them.
5,THE MAN THAT COMES OUT IS VERY COURTEOUS AND NICE. HE TAKES HIS TIME AND ALWAYS HAS A NICE CONVERSATION WITH ME BEFORE HE LEAVES. THEY ARE JUST A WONDERFUL COMPANY.

1,"Johnathan Delgado (don't know who Jesse is) assured me that the company was licensed and insured and that he would email the paperwork. When asked again, he said ""I'll send them tomorrow""... As he could never provide the Condo association with the documents, he made me waste 2 weeks waiting for him to do it. SO DISRESPECTFUL!"
5,"I was very pleased. Jesse was on time, did great work. Absolutely would call him again."
5,Falero did an awesome job at fixing our sink and installing a new quality disposal. Mike was amazing to talk with and walked us through each step. I can’t say enough about these guys and their work ethic and sterling quality of their work. I would not only recommend them to anyone but I would use them again in a heartbeat!!!
1,"Vendor is not licensed as a plumber per Miami Dade BCCO database. He arrived to work in our building which requires license and insurance and chose to register as a guest not a vendor to avoid this issue. With that said, he seemed nice however he vistited unit 2 times and each time failed to fix issue. The first visit he arrived with no tools or inclination to do more then look at the unit and rep...

4,All work was done well and efficiently.
5,"Fantastic! I would definately hire this contractor for another project. I received a fair quote and was able to discuss the details. I was able to easily schedule my visit. I received email communication to confirm the visit. The technician arrived right on time and, even though he was working outside, he wore a mask the whole time. Justin K. was clean, respectful and professional. He knew what he...

5,"Unbelievable! Beyond impressed with quality of service, and the technician that arrived, very punctually was very knowledgeable and polite. Being a homeowner for approximately 10 years, I have dealt with quite an assortment of contractors. Mr. Handyman has gained my trust after this experience, especially after calling multiple contractors with a state of urgency, all of whom replied they ""may be ...

5,"Eric did a phenomenal job repairing our deck and was a joy to talk to. The work he did speaks for itself, and he is obviously is skilled at what he does, but what was also great was that he offered to do additional repairs outside the initial project scope. I would definitely hire him for future deck repair and woodworking needs again."
5,"Awesome. Bill did some of the same work for me last year, so it’s nice that they try to keep staff you’re used to do the jobs needed, if possible."
5,Very well. The service was able straighten and reattach a long length of siding blown off and reattached siding tat was loosened. The serviceman arrived earlier than estimated and completed the work quickly.
5,Mr Handyman did good job considering the circumstances. My mailbox was knocked down but the ground was froze. I was provided with a sound temporary solution. Plan on using Mr Handy man for the permanent installation.
5,"The Service Technician was extremely professional and paid close attention to our needs. He advised us that the screening did not need to be replaced, but only needed to be “re-seated” in the door frame (That saved us the cost of a new screen). I would recommend Mr Handyman of Waukesha to anyone for household repair."
4,Not completed yet. Was unable to repair. Will be replacing whole unit
5,"Great! Ron Marish was polite, pleasant and completed the job quickly."
5,It went well. It has been over two weeks and no mice. David was very professional and did a good job. He cleaned up after the job was done. I would definitely hire them again.
5,"I could not be more satisfied with Mr. Handyman of Waukesha! Bill came to do the evaluation and it was clear he knows home repair. He is personable and I felt I could trust him - was glad that he was assigned to come back for the repair work. I also appreciate their flexibility - Bill advanced the project to the point where I can do finish it with the painting. Jessica in the office was great with...

5,"EXCECEPTIONIAL! Work was done as estimated. Removed all waste, and vacuumed. Professional work. Will hire for more projects!"
5,Everything was great. Professional and polite. Fast response times. Fixed both of the issues we had. Didn’t price shop so I’m not sure if they’re competitive price wise but we were okay with what was charged.
5,"Kevin Lucht was excellent. His work was top notch. He was professional, considerate , timely and a very kind man. The coordinator Carry was great at her job ...kept me informed and answered all questions I had during the process. I would highly recommend and will be calling again!"
5,The quality of the repair was perfect! It looks now completely like it was before Amazon truck hit it; no-one even would notice a difference.

5,"I was very pleased with the responsiveness of both the office and the technician, Bill. I was kept informed every step of the way and the job was completed in a timely matter and with professionalism. I never used a handyman service before and am not able to compare price and rate the cost, I know enough that I will use Waukesha Mr. Handyman again."
5,"The entire process was excellent. We highly recommend Martin at Waukesha and Milwaukee County North Handyman, Supurb."
5,It went very well and timely. Extremely satisfied and will hire again for different projects.
5,All went well. will monitor if leak has stopped and will have them return to replace drywall..
5,"It went great. The technician, Bill Andersen, did a terrific job scraping/painting the garage. He went above and beyond in numerous ways (e.g., cleaning the gutters on the garage so they look brand new, meticulous scraping, making suggestions that ended up improving the look of the garage). He also replaced the leaf guards on the gutters around our house and did some other repairs on some of the t...

1,I rated them F because there was no follow-up to my initial inquiry.

4,Price I paid was more than quoted but the job was well done and of all the contractors I contacted they were the most responsive. Very up fronT with pricing and I like they send a picture of your contractor before he comes to your home. Very communicative and professional!
5,"The job was more complicated than expected due to age of pocket doors and settling of house and took more time to complete. Ralph the technician was very knowledgeable and efficient given the more complex job. He completed the work in a very professional manner and was friendly and courteous.

5,Everything went great! Don took everything into consideration when figuring out what needed to be done before starting the job. The job went faster than expected. Don did a fantastic job and I would recommend for any job needed to be done. Thanks again.
4,The carpenter had to run home to get his compressor which delayed the start and had to come back to the house after the project was done to pick up his cell phone charger that he left behind. The work itself was just fine.
5,Excellent job. Would use them again.
5,Technician was on time and work was done in a very professional manner.
5,Went well the man they sent ( Jerry) was very professional and kept the area very neat. I would ask for him again his work was outstanding
5,The work was done quickly and with precision. The repaired area is matched perfectly to the existing drywall and texture. There is no sign of the original cut out.
5,Dennis was great. Sent me a text right away and asked for photos then quoted me a very fair price. Set up a time a few days later to come out and did the initial repair and came back the next day and did all the finishing work. Very personable and professional too.
4,"slight scheduling issue other than that work man was extremely polite and work performed was satisfactory. front door seems ready for winter weather. Job involved removing door, sinking door hinges deeper and evenly, striping one side of door casing and installing a new door sweep."
2,Had an appointment scheduled and got a call and left a message on the Friday before to cancel the appointment. I had to call back to find out why and the carpenter quit and they had no one to do the work.
4,Very Poor. Didn't want the job. Slow to get back with me but honest.
5,Excellent job! Looking forward to working with Justin again on my next project. Hanging pictures on my wall.
1,wanted to be prepaid in advance via estimate--not interested
4,it went as best it could on the repair
1,"The guy called 20 min. before the appointment to cancel, by which time I had already rearranged my schedule for the day to meet with him. He made excuses about his worker calling in sick or something and when I noted that that was not my fault he copped a very rude and unprofessional attitude to the point where I simply terminated the phone call. I would NEVER spend money with these people. RUN AW...

First off the handyman showed up to do a drywall repair and did not have any drywal...

When I pointed out the unfinished part of the house, I was informed that the quote was time/materials, and I would re...

2,"I had a water damage on my living room drywall and it took almost 4 visits spread across 2 weeks to fix it. The quality of work was poor and they were supposed to complete the work with interior painting too. But till date, after 3 weeks of follow up, the painting work is still not completed. No response to emails...I made the mistake of paying them for the work done till date. Now they have got p...

1,"I strongly discourage using this company. First, the handyman that quoted our job quit and a different handyman came in his place a day early. The new man did a terrible job muffing and taping. He took the entire day to get about half of a standard size living room done. When your paying by the hour that’s a big deal. The next day when he was to come back he never showed and the company could not ...

5,It was an excellent experience. Dean went above and beyond in fixing the issue and was meticulous in the finishing. He also came up with a solution for some rotting wood at the base of the window/door. He also came up with a solution to the cause/source of the water problem. The end result was a night and day difference. I look forward to working with Dean in the future.
1,"If I could give this company zero stars I would. This is the worst experience that I have ever had with a contractor. I truly cannot even understand how these people are still in business. We called Mr. Handyman to have two windows installed in place of one window. We called this type of service because the existing opening would need to be changed for the two new windows to fit and I could not fi...

I uploaded some pictures to Mr. Handyman and the two in the office (one being the owner) said it would probably take a days worth of work with 2 people.

5,Matched and installed a deadbolt for an exterior door. I was slightly disappointed that the deadbolt was something i could have purchased at the local DIY store but it works fine and the installation was professionally done.
5,"I've used them several times, and they work with you, they are always there when I need them and they do very good work. And if they don't do good work, they'll come back and they'll fix it, no questions asked.I've got to also buy my own materials. All the other places, they bring the material and they have a mark-up on it. There's no other place that I know of, I just had some work done by Monty ...

3,"I went with this company due to what I seemed to be a fair price based on the estimate given by the installer. The actual installer and customer service representative on the phone were very easy to work with and pleasent. We missed the original install date but rescheduling was not a major issue. The installation went smoothly and the installer was very careful not to make a mess. I did experienc...

5,"If you need a professional company to help you with repairs this is the company you should call. I cannot thank them enough for helping me out with an emergency repair I needed today due to damaged caused by one of my tenants. Mr. Handyman went out of their way to come all the way to Shorewood and fix the doors that were broken and caused a security problem. This is a fantastic provider and I know...

5,"We found them on Angie's List. They were very professional. They responded quickly and they also followed up with quotes fast as well. Overall, they were very nice people. One thing they did was instead of doing everything, they even gave us options so that we could fix it ourselves if we didn’t want to pay them to help save us money as well, so they were very accommodating. I would definitely cal...

4,"The first guy did not do a good job. However, they sent another guy to fix and complete the work."
4,The service was okay. I felt the price was a little expensive.
3,His service is fine but the cost is way too high for the work done.
5,It went well. They're always easy to reach and they can get things scheduled and done quickly. They can also buy and pickup all materials so I wasn't having to do any running around myself.
4,"Because they charged me a $50 trip charge and never disclosed that this would be part of the costs, I feel like they deceived me. I would not hire them to come back because of this."
5,"Super friendly and professional on the phone and in person. Did the jobs quickly (did not milk the hourly rate). Keep in mind that if they have to get parts or supplies that you don't provide or tell them that they'll need to bring (they do inform you of this when you set up your appointment) that the time to go get things is billable. When I have another list of stuff to get done, I will definite...

4,"The work was done quickly and well; the only issue was the complexity due to the number of switches turning on a light. The handyman needed additional help and added some time to the project. It turned out good, but was more difficult to estimate total cost."
5,"He was within budget, on time, and very professional. The job turned out great. He was reasonably priced. I would use them again in the future."
5,"Gave accurate time estimate, arrive on time every time, help prevent future problems."
4,"Overall it went OK and the end product was fine. The workman, however, broke the vanity basin that he was installing by applying too much torque before the basin was properly set. The basin broke and flying porcelain hit the workman in the head, causing significant bleeding. Stuff happens, and the workman was apologetic (and the cut wasn't as bad as it appeared). He also indicated that he had seve...

2,"I thought the trip charge was a little high. He came to do a standard plumbing job which he knew in advance. You would think he had standard plumbing supplies in his truck, but no he left again to pick up parts at a store which is 4 miles down the road and returned 1 hour later charging me 88 dollars for the trip. while doing the job he spilled glue on the floor which stained it and never came off...

3,"We hired Mr. Handyman to install doors in December of last year. Quality and price were good, however punctuality was not. We were the first job of the morning, and he was an hour late. The poor grades are a result of them never following up on a larger job we had called on. After a positive experience with the doors, we called for an estimate to remodel a bathroom and convert a room into a 1st fl...

My husband is on oxygen and the dust caused serious breathing problems. I have contacted the owner Marty and have spoken to him multiple times. He is unwilling to take responsibility and said that I shou...

He was on time and he completed the job in the time he thought it would take. He was extremely professional. I also spoke with Debbie in the office numerous times and she, too, was great to work with. She...

2,"When they came over to do the work I needed they didn’t give me the discount the flyer promised, and they charged a travel charge as well!"
5,"He completed his job in a couple days with the two areas we had agreed upon. He was up front and honest with everything and the price was what it should be, with no added charges. When he came over he noticed that our screen door gets stuck in the ""open"" position, which had been a problem since we moved in, but wasn't as high of an item on our to do list. He had an extra part for the door and fixe...

Even though we've had a lot of rain lately and thought it would be awhile before they could come out, Brad was there on 6/22/11 at 8:00 am as promised. It took him about an 1 1/2 hrs. to complete the job. Our gutters are absolutely immaculate now. The cost was a little pricey at $86.00/hr. However, due to my husband having recent surgery, we ...

They've been very punctual, courteous, professional and performed the work in a timely manner on all three visits. They have an hourly rate, which is reasonable. They also provide Angie's List discounts. The owner of My Handyman had subcontracted out another company when we had the gutter guards installed, ...

5,"These guys are exceptional. They immediately discovered that the builder had never included supports, so they added the supports, replaced the rough cedar posts - on time, at budget, you cannot see that the posts were replaced. A pleasure to work with - and will do so again when needed next time."
1,"We met Marty on April 13, 2010. We went over everything we needed done. Porch railings on bottom, some window sills covered in aluminum, garage door trim and rubber seal replaced.We told him we would like it done by end of April. He said ok. We waited for some time, we called him, he called us, eventually he said after a couple of weeks, that he couldn't find railings that long and will see if he ...

He was very prompt in responding to my call and finished the work on time. The price was also reasonable. He told me what he wanted to do and asked me if I wanted him to do anything else. He is very neat and tidy. He cleaned up after himself. I have recommended him to ...

3,"They did what they came over here to do, but I remember that we were not that pleased with the work. They were responsive, but we just were not very happy."
5,"He installed 2 deadbolts, changed the locks on 3 doors and gave me keys for them. He also went to the hardware store and got me a door knob with a lock in it and he did a nice job and I was satisfied with him. He was accommodating and waited for me because I was late."
5,He did a really good job. He cleaned up everything when he was completed and was very prompt.
5,"He was very polite and did a great job of explaining what he would do and how it would be done. They gave me a 25 dollar discount for being an Angie's List member. He did a great job, overall!"
5,"He was very prompt, knowledgeable of how to work with difficulties and was tidy. He performed a high quality of service."
5,I would use him again in the future.
5,We have no complaints about him at all. He was very personal and very polite. He kept me informed about the job how explained everything. We were very satisfied.
5,They are really good. They are prompt and on time. They got the job done in one day. They are professional and I have used them before. Their prices are very fair.
4,"The first employee was very courteous and did an excellent job with the patching, texturizing and painting. Unfortunately, the caulking wasn't quite up to par. After talking to Amy at My Handyman, we made another appointment for someone else to come out to re-caulk. Another employee from My Handyman (Chip) came out about a week later and re-did the caulk at no charge. Chip did a good job, is a ple...

5,I was very happy with the quality of workmanship that was performed and promptness of arrival! He was very willing and able to take care of the miscellaneous tasks that needed attention. I will use them again.
3,"Randy was late the first day, seemed courteous enough but ill prepared to perform task. Second day was on time, was courteous, but again ill prepared for tasks and made numerous trips to his truck for tools he should have taken with him the first trip. Work completed was done well but feel the cost was out of line with the amount of work."
5,"On time, polite, communicated clearly, explained his work plan completely, gave us options when able. Had trouble reaching company after hours - we are only home in the evenings, we had to leave 3 messages before the company actually called back - this may have been an answering service issue."
5,They were very responsive at returning our call and coming out to do the work. They came back free of charge to make some adjustments to a lock that was installed. We were very satisfied with the work.
5,THEY REALLY WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO ACCOMMODATE MY NEED FOR A FAST APPOINTMENT. I WAS RELOCATING AND HAD TO GET THE WORK FINISHED IN ORDER TO LIST MY HOUSE FOR SALE. I CALLED LATE IN THE AFTERNOON AND THE HANDYMAN WAS THERE THE NEXT DAY. THE WORK WAS EXCELLENT.
5,WHAT I LIKED ABOUT HOW HE WORKED IS THAT HE WOULD MAKE CERTAIN TO HAVE ACCURACY IN PLACING THE ITEMS WHERE I WANTED THEM PLACED. WHEN HE WAS DONE HE ASKED IF I NEEDED ANYTHING ELSE DONE AND HE DID SOME ADDITIONAL CHORES FOR ME. I WAS TOLD WHAT THEIR RATES WERE BEFORE THEY STARTED AND I THOUGHT IT WAS EXPENSIVE AND I WAS GLAD TO HAVE IT DONE.
5,"MY HANDYMAN (CHIP) IS A PERFECTIONIST. WHEN I SCHEDULE HIM FOR WORK, I KNOW THE FINISHED REPAIR WORK WILL LOOK NEW. THE OWNER SOMETIMES STOPS BY TO SEE HOW THINGS ARE GOING. THE COMPANY IS VERY FOCUSED TOWARDS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION."
5,"Polite, courteous, on time, very helpful, and knowledgeable. Excellent!!"
5,"They are not real cheap and I have used them about three times now. They really know how to problem solve and all the people I have worked with have been very knowledgeable. They have a service call charge, a trip charge, cost per hour and cost of materials. If you want the quality sometimes you have to pay the price. I would hire them again. They do not make excuses and I have never had to have t...

3,"I TOLD HIM THAT MY SPECIFICATIONS MUST BE TO VA STANDARDS, HE SAID THAT HE GOES BY THE STATE STANDARDS. I FELT LIKE I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO ARGUE THIS POINT, I JUST WANTED AN ESTIMATE BASED ON MY SPECIFICATIONS. HE DIDN'T ITEMIZE OR GIVE ME A DRAWING OF THE ITEMS THE WAY THAT I NEEDED. HIS PRICING I FELT WAS VERY HIGH."

5,"Joe did great work. Timely, neat, and pleasant. It was so great to have him around to get to the things I haven't been able to do myself. I provided all the materials, and Joe was able to install everything and make his own adjustments if necessary. Very knowledgeable and definitely worth every penny. I have already hired them on for additional work and I recommend them highly."
5,"THIS COMPANY WAS VERY PROMPT IN RESPONDING AND INSTALLING OUR NEW STORM DOORS. THE INSTALLER WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND DID AN EXEMPLARY JOB. WE WOULD HIRE THEM AGAIN, AND NO DOUBT WE WILL."

4,Was told to have mirror cut down but if they had measured the counter top I w not have to. Cost $25 and mirror looks terrible where placed.
4,The work of the Handyman was great.
2,Workmanship was shoddy. They damaged the door they were installing. They damaged the handrail on the steps. The door still doesn’t close right.
1,"Top to bottom the worst handyman experience of my life. Simple tv hang turned into property damage and a 1 hour job took 4. It was bad. They didn’t measure or plan, just kept drilling holes (14 holes for 4 bolts) and winging it. Laughed off my concerns. Scratched my floors. I told them up front I’m a renter and to be very careful-they promised they would and then...yeah. Don’t hire these guys."
4,"good job, and I was happy with the work performance."
5,Did a excellent job

Still hard to believe that they sent a crew on such short notice when the front door was smashed in and could not be locked."
5,Overall it was a pleasant and professional experience.

3,Very responsive and on time appointment for quote. They wanted a 50 percent deposit for minor repair handyman type work. I felt uncomfortable with this way of doing business. Too much risk for the customer. If high dollar parts were involved then maybe.

He looked ed at other repairs that he assured me could be taked care of which I will be scheduling shortly. Good company."
5,"Joe came out to give a free estimate to screen in a porch that required two sides to be screened. His estimate was $2500 to complete this job. He was very friendly and seemed knowledgeable and came up with some good ideas on how to handle the work. However, we did not choose him to do this project due to the price. I guess as a first time home-owner I sometimes get ""sticker shock""!"
5,Joe was very particular with all details. He even had the carpet removed to prevent it from being damaged. He was careful which subcontractors he used to cut the the hole in the basement wall. Gas and water lines had to be rerouted in order to dig the hole for the egress window.
5,"They did a really good job. We had a problem with out back door where water starts standing and it rotted the wood around the door frame, they replaced it. It seems to be expensive but they did it correctly. They used the proper wood for weather. We've been very happy with their work."

5,"It went superb. I have been out of reach for about a month due to personal reasons, and he called me back to check up on me. He went above and beyond the call of duty."
4,They showed up on time and did what they said they were going to do. Their prices also stayed the same as their quote but they might have been a little high.
5,"They showed up on time and did a great job under very adverse conditions. It was wet and cold. They tore off the decking, repaired joists and put new decking back on. It took 3 days as they promised. Cleaned up very well."
4,"I called the company based on Angie's list reviews; they were evidently very busy, and so even the estimate date was several weeks in the future, but that didn't matter. The woman I talked to was very polite and precise about dates and making sure we were both on the same page. On the estimate date I received a call a little bit before the actual time, asking if he could come a little early as he ...

4,"I think they would have done a good job but I did not go with them. The person who came was very professional. At that time I just felt that their bid was a little higher. But after having the work done, I thought that their prices were probably very realistic. I would rate them very highly as far as their promptness and professionalism based only on the quote experience I had with them."
4,Used Josh and his service for a couple of small repairs and a door installation. He did a through job on each task and did not cut corners. Had a minor issue with the finish on a door installation but he came back promptly and made corrections. I would recommend him for any small handyman work or repairs.
4,"The price was reasonable. It was a good experience. The service was good. It was really, really fast. I am pleased."
2,"It was a bad meeting, the job would have not bee done by this company. I got someone else to put in my door."
5,"I had ideas about what I wanted, and the people where eager to listen to what I wanted; when I wasn't sure which way to turn, they had lots of ideas to help me sort it all out. I worked with Angela (cabinets), Dixie (flooring) and Mike (appliances) and they were all extremely knowledgeable and patient. It took a while (about 2 months) and I hated living without a kitchen for all that time, but I u...

5,He was on time. I bought all the fixtures and had them all ready so he didn't have to go to get parts. He showed up and did the work.
5,"I needed an estimate for a bathroom remodel that was already half finished, but abandoned. This company was prompt and professional, and upfront about the challenges and cost of finishing work started by others. Although I did not hire this company for this project, I felt confident about the details and price of their quote, and would seek quotes on future projects."
5,"Josh began by doing several small handyman jobs for me. He does good work, his prices are fair, and he's trust worthy. My house needed painting and he bid on that and gave me a very fair price. His crew was very neat and I'm very pleased with the whole paint job. So, when there is anything I need done at my house (whatever size job) - Josh is the man!"
5,"Their people were really professional, friendly and nice. The only thing I didn't like was when I had them first out there was that they didn't actually get up on the roof to look around. We had already been up there and I kind of told them different things that were wrong. I didn't like the idea that they didn't get up there and look for themselves. That was the only thing I didn't like. I think ...

5,"He is wonderful, the most wonderful contractor in the world. He did more in one day than some of these others do in a whole year. They always walked out before the job was done. He is the one. I don't think I will ever need another. He is too good. I have been taken by so many other people that's why I like Angie's List."
4,"First man came out to my mom's house to find out the problem. No one got on the roof to look around he was just going by what I told him. They e-mailed out a quote, which I accepted and was asked to give half down. Then we scheduled an appointment which was very timely. The handyman that came was very pleasant and did a great job but going back to what I said about no one getting on the roof, they...

5,Excellent. Identified further issues and project completed on time and on estimate. Look forward to working with them again.
5,He arrived on time. Quickly assessed the need and completed the work. Also wanted him to do small plumbing job but he said he could not do it.
4,"He came out a couple of years ago to give me a quote, but I thought it was too high. I really didn't have any opinion either way, the reason I didn't choose him was because he was too high."
4,"The service sent out a man who was extremely nice and very prompt, he complimented my work but ended up having to take down most of the drywall to fix the seams. His work was excellent, however since it was only a 2' by 14' section and I had all the materials and had performed all the demo and structure build looking back I can't see why it cost $600. I've recently had some work performed by anoth...

I think he is really great. His is really painless service, ju...

5,They were great and did it in half an hour. He spoke to his boss to help reduce the price.
5,"Crew did a thorough job on the repair.?When they came for the first visit, they advised that the area had not completely dried and suggested holding off on the repair for a week to allow an remaining moisture to dry out. ?When they returned, they were able to coordinate all of the work, between drywall and painting in a narrow window of time."
5,"They were prompt, punctual, responsive and got the job done efficiently. We were very pleased with their level of professionalism and expertise."
5,They were very professional. They set up an appointment and were on time. It went well. Their estimate was pretty high. I would use them in the future.
5,"We ended up not using this company, as we did some of the work ourselves, but I was very impressed by this company's response, the professional contract and estimate, and most of all by the follow-up calls to see if we had the work completed and/or if we had any other needs or questions about the remodel work that we did."
1,The response to my request for an estimate was initially very good. I received a call and the handyman showed up on time. My son talked to him about what needed to be done. My son said the gentleman was very polite and seemed very professional. The handyman told my son that an estimate would be emailed to me in a few days. Never received an email or an estimate and never heard from him again.
3,"I was called at 1 pm and told Louisville Handyman Inc?was running late for my 12:30-1:00 appointment for an estimate of deck install/roof/door replacement. We discussed him coming later that afternoon but was unable to set a time due to his schedule and mine. This was ok and I said we can make appointment another day. Then the odd thing was he asked if I had other estimates already. We reviewed th...

5,"Appointment made over the telephone. The service person Sam arrived on the exact time and date. He did an excellent replacement of the damaged drywall. Once compound was applied and dried. He painted the area and it is now impossible to tell where the repair was made. He cleaned up his work area, was very thorough and professional. We will continue to use this company in the future."
5,"After we agreed to the price, the planning began. From the start date, everyone involved showed up exactly when they said they would. All of the work was completed as planned. Eric was involved from the beginning to make sure all was on schedule and that there were no problems. I could call Eric at any time with questions or concerns and he was very responsive and always went out of his way to mak...

5,There were some leaking pipes. They fixed that leak and cut some holes in the wall and patch them up. The guy that came to do the job was really nice. He did a great job. The work he did looks good. I felt they were a little expensive based on another quote we got. I will consider using them in the future again.
5,Great experience. I have now used Louisville Handyman three times. I have always had prompt and professional service. Would definitely recommend this company and I will use them again.
5,"Louisville Handyman was extremely professional, yet wonderfully personable. I definitely got my money's worth! I'm a very inexperienced homeowner, had just moved to a new town, and had a long list of ""little things"" from the home inspection report. Eric Thornton, the estimator, was terrific! He helped me prioritize the home inspection items and had some really helpful suggestions. His empathy far ...

1,I did not appreciate the extreme price they quoted me.
5,"They were good, but, were on the expensive side. I may use their services in the future."
5,He did the work in the most cost-effective way possible. He was very good and very reasonably priced. I was expecting a much bigger deal. He came up with a good common sense and effective solution. I like his service and the way he operates. He tries to the best of his ability to give his honest opinion. He's an excellent carpenter who uses his time efficiently. I loved him. I would use him again.
5,He did an excellent job. I had no complaints. I didn't price anywhere else; I just wanted it done. He was very responsive and came at the time he said he would. He was very professional. I would absolutely use him again.
5,I have used them in the past. They are excellent. I would not hesitate to use them again. They were prompt and gave reasonable bids. They were generally able to stay within their bid amount. They do high quality work.
5,"It entailed a lot of work and it was a good quote. We just didn't use their services. Just by talking to them and having them come out to my house and give me an estimate, they were very professional. If I could have afforded the quote, I would have used them. They were too expensive. They have a really good reputation as far as I could tell from Angie's List and just from other sources around her...

5,Great! Very professional and prompt.
4,"Could have been better, really should not have taken 3 days."

Well, it’s now the end ...

He said he would get in touch with me the next day...his schedule had become to busy to do the work...

He did discover that additional wood would be needed for the job due to more extensive wood rot. He secured the additional supplies and still finished the job on time as promised. The quoted price did go up however even with the increase, the price...

5,"Punctual, performed work exactly as agreed, nice guys. Doors look great!"
5,"The owner, David Hammond, provided a detailed, written estimate of the job. After the estimate was accepted, we agreed on a time to complete the work. David met the schedule.

My husband and I were very happy with the work and would recommend We Can Do to anyone."
5,"This was new construction. a bedroom for our 3 year old grand daughter. They worked quickly, were fun to have around and never minded that they were under the watchful eye of a three year old supervisor. Great work, careful cleanup."
5,David was pleasant to work with and did an excellent job on screening in our patio.

5,Everything they did was very good.
1,"We chose We Can Do depending on the Angie's List ratings. I called and left a message several days passed and he called and left a message. I called and left a message several days passed and he called and left a message. I called to respond and could not leave a message. I understand being busy. However, not even responding to a possible client or making an attempt is not professional."

5,Our bathroom upstairs had a leaking and stained the ceiling over the kitchen area. So we wanted to have it repainted. I have tried a few handymen and neither wanted to take the job because it was a small job and required multiple trips. Dave gladly accepted it and did a wonderful job.

5,"David did a fantastic job - we couldn't be more pleased. He was hardworking and honest in his dealings. He did a lot of work in a short period of time, I'm certain we would have paid twice as much with a different provider. He took on our BIG problems with ease and make them look like small issues. We will definitely use him again as we need other things done around the house."
5,David called soon after I purchased the coupon from Angie's List and scheduled a time to come and see what I needed done. He took all the measurements for purchasing and installing a banister to my basement on a concrete wall. He returned about a week later and completed the work in about 45 minutes. I am beyond pleased with the job he did.
5,"The contractor was very efficient in attempting to fix the existing fixture. After determining that we would need a replacement, we were able to find the same model at Home Depot. Mr. Hammond responded very quickly in another trip to our home to install the new fixture.We were very pleased with the response time and the effort made to fix the old fixture."

I feel confident that they would let me know if a job required another person with different skills than they have."
5,he does great work but best of all he explains every thing and the ways we might want something done and how much each way would cost so that we can choose. We will certainly have him do work for us in the near future. My husband would like a little lower cost.

I called ""We Can Do LLC"" and Mr. Hammond showed up at my door a few hours later, gave me a reasonable quote and started the job right there. My ceiling did not require a huge drywall job (like the other two led me to believe), but merely a plaster repair. He came everyday to apply coats of plaster and then sand...

5,They did a very good job. The job was done quickly by one worker and he completed the job within 2 hours. He did show up on time and cleaned up after he was done with the job. They came and started the project within two days of the time when I called them.
5,"I thought he was great. He came when he said he would. He did what he said he would do. We were very pleased with him. He called us back, a lot of times people in that industry don't do that. He showed up on time. He cleaned up all the mess. I was very happy with him."
5,Excellent service and work!
5,Great service.
5,Great.
5,see review.
5,Went great. Very thorough
5,A very good experience.
5,"Joshua was incredible! He did a perfect job and did it quickly! With Covid being a worry, I asked him to do the work in my garage which is not heated. I felt terrible about that but he was very agreeable and polite. I could not have asked for a better person to do the job. I would definitely hire him again. He gets a A+ from me!"
5,Wonderful. I would hire them again.
5,We are very pleased with this work. Repair of walls looks great. The pattern in the plaster was matched and painted. Joshua was on time and got right to work. He cleaned up after the job was complete.
5,"Joshua showed up on time and was ready to go with all the materials. He estimated it would take 2-3 hours, and it ended up taking about that time. He is professional with a great attitude and I would hire him again. This was a fairly small project which many won't do because it's not worth it, but Joshua understands one small project usually leads to more in the future. He has good business sense,...

1,"first time the call did not go through. Next time, I left a message, no one ever called back"
5,"Joshua has been great. He has proven to be a tremendous help in preparing our house in the Highlands for our move this spring. So far he has installed a kitchen sink, water filtration system, garbage disposal, new lighting inside and outside, oak handrails and newel posts for the main stairs, a new 15' countertop in the laundry area, new front storm door, replaced a dimmer switch while re-anchorin...

5,Very well. I was very impressed with his attitude and professionalism
5,"The first handyman I contacted through Angie's list did NOT get the job done because he had ""bigger irons in the fire,"" and I do not think he knew what he was doing. He kept bumping me off of his agenda over a period of three days. I would NEVER call him again The second one was considerate, gave me a reasonable price, fixed my two projects, and was prompt. Both jobs were done to my satisfaction a...

5,Ceiling looks great and he did a great job! Will definitely hire again!
4,"The work was performed on schedule and correctly. However, the drywall finish wasn't great. The mesh was still showing when complete. Thankfully the drywall contractor I had come in afterwards fixed the work."
5,"I'm providing an A grade rating to this company because of their honesty. I loved that this company was transparent and did not commit just to get our business and then make us wait like so many others do. I spoke to Josh and he was honest at providing his availability. Even though we didn't to do business with him due to our immediate needs, we will certainly keep him in mind if ever needed."
5,It went well. The work was done quickly and the craftsmanship is good.
5,"Handyman was timely, professional and helpful."
5,"When we finally connected, he came over and did an excellent job!"
5,It went well. He was the lower of two bids for the above work.
5,He as always did a great job for a fair price. Highly recommended!
5,The work turned out excellent and I would hire again and/or recommend him to other people. The workman ship was excellent and complete.
5,"Joshua is very good at what he does! I LOVE my new bathroom. I had intended to just get needed repairs done in my bathroom, but Joshua suggested some tweaks that would update the entire room. He was willing to do whatever I wanted, but I went with his suggestions and could not be more thrilled!! And he stayed within my budget. Excellent work, professional, kept work space clean, responded quickly ...

5,"Very good, extremely nice and did a great job of repairing walls and ceiling. Even went to Home Depot to get caulk to complete time I had paid for."
5,"Joshua was great. Arrived early, did the job needed, was very friendly and answered all my questions."
2,"After much back and forth as to time to do the work, a schedule was finally agreed upon. I took off work and waited and waited. . . finally I emailed him and his response was that he had not put my name in the time slot. Not a word yet about rescheduling or refunding coupon cost."
5,"Very well so smooth on dry wall, I only have to sand a little bit -very professional."
5,Joshua performed the work above and beyond my expectations. He explained what he was going to do and gave me great information for what to look for to determine if we have a larger issue than just old grout.
5,"Great! Prompt, courteous, excellent work."
4,"Punctual, very nice. I may have been expecting too much on the crack in my ceiling."
5,Josh came on time and did an excellent job. He explained everything he did and told me hints to try to prevent it from happening again. I will definitely use Josh again on future projects.
5,I am very pleased with the quality of work and would recommend this professional.
5,I was very impressed. We will be hiring him again.
5,"He began work as agreed and on-time. Was careful in repairing what could be repaired and what had to be replaced. Nice job ""distressing"" replacement wood to match original. Came in at the lower end of the quoted range."
5,Excellent! He even bought the new hinges.
5,"Sun porch is approximately 10 x 12. We supplied paint and primer. Joshua recommended a high-quality primer since we were painting an interior vinyl surface. He also supplied some extra primer. Joshua took extra care with caulking brad holes, taping baseboard and metal hardware, and any other imperfections. Nice job! Repaired a 90-year old ""Russwin"" door latch. Removed a bathroom door to completely...

5,"He is excellent and very fast and neat. He does excellent work as well. In fact, I damaged someone elses house and I had him go and fix that too at a reasonable rate. I would highly recommend him."
5,"Josh did a great job. He arrived on time, worked fast, and did a great job. He is highly qualified and is a very nice guy, too. We have already asked him to do more work for us."
5,"While in the midst of a renovation, we ran into a problem requiring installation of a new ceiling electrical box. Joshua has done multiple jobs for us in the past so I called and asked if he could come the next day so we wouldn't have to delay our project. Joshua was gracious to come even though he had a full day's work scheduled. He's a gentleman and always does a good job."
2,"His caulking job was fine, good work. BUT: IT took him 3 1/2 hours to caulk 4 tubs??? He double charged me because he said the Angies List deal was only for one residence and I had him do two apartments. What's the difference: $75/hr for two hrs. of caulking in either kitchen or bathroom is what I bought. So I paid him additional $75 - culda got it done with Lowe's or Home Depot guys for $50. But:...

5,"If you are a perfectionist (or are married to a perfectionist like I am), Josh is your guy. He replaced four exterior doors and three screen doors in our circa 1964 house with new doors from Home Depot. They look great and fit perfectly. He is a great communicator, and does an outstanding job for a very reasonable price!"
2,"The drywall repair was okay, but wasn't smooth, and they suggested it was ready to be repainted, which is just silly. In the process of the ceiling drywall repairs, the moulding at the top of one of my cabinets was broken off, and repaired by haphazardly nailing it back in place (crooked) and bending the nails onto the wood (?!). I would have preferred that they admit they did not have the proper ...

4,It was alright. We were not able to come a convenient appointment until the March or so. He offered to come but we were unable to make our appointments work. He showed up when we agreed to and kind of cleaned up after himself. The price good. I don't think that he did as good a job on finishing it up especially with the spackle. I think that could have been done a little bit better.
5,Josh did a terrific job! He arrived in time was friendly and professional. Kept the area clean. Would definitely recommend Josh and would hire again.
5,Joshua provided the estimate on a prior visit and showed up the day he scheduled the repair even though it was raining all day. He completed the work in a day and agreed to add on some extra indoor repairs I requested. He and his coworker were professional and thoughtful.
5,It went fine. It was just the cost of the Deal. They were a little late but they called and let me know so it was fine. I would recommend them. They had a lot done in the 2 hours.
5,"At first we had some difficulty (punctuality, professionalism, thoroughness of the job) as we were working with a gentleman who was an employee for the owner, Joshua. For reasons unknown to me this employee no longer works for Joshua. After I began working directly with Joshua things got immediately better. He and his assistant were very professional, polite and flexible. They were eager to work w...

5,"Joshua ran a little late the morning of the appointment, but was good about informing me (I was off all day, so it wasn't any kind of problem). Quality work and looks good. The job was bigger than the 2-hours purchased through Angie's List, but he's coming back late this week to finish the job."
4,"The worker arrived on time the first day, and worked on caulking the shower/tub. I also asked him to return to repair some drywall in various areas of the house at an additional price. He was late the second time he came, and did not call to let me know. The caulking work was not acceptable, and I asked him to re-do it. Even the re-do was not acceptable to me. The drywall repair was good. The youn...

3,New grout did not match the remaining old grout - the new was much darker. I declined the provider's offer of a re-do.
5,Joshua Roark came write on time. He promptly started working. I had a leak over the granite tile above the kitchen counter. The kitchen counter tile had lifted. Joshua carefully removed the tile without a scratch and placed it back in place He also fixed the drywall above the kitchen counter. My wife came home and was very pleased with the work performed. I would highly recommend him.
1,We received no reply form our inquiry to this provider.
5,"The handyman and his helper arrived on time, worked quickly and finished the task in the two-hour time-frame that I had already paid for. I was very pleased with the finished product, and with how knowledgeable this handyman was of historic properties. He shared some very good ideas with me about how to proceed with the bathroom renovation."
5,Came on time and completed job I less than 3 hours. My wife had been wanting this done but I just couldn't get around to it. Happy I called them. Excellent job
5,"Very professional, friendly, cost-efficient work. Would use again."
5,"Josh and Jamal were on time, extremely courteous and professional. They completed the work requested in a timely manner and cleaned the area accordingly. I would definitely recommend them and would hire them again."
5,Old caulk was removed (which was a challenge). New caulking was completed. It made a tremendous difference in the appearance in the areas that were done. Everyone was professional. I would definitely use them again!
5,Professional Handyman arrived on time and went right to work. I showed him some other projects I wanted done and he prepared an estimate. His rates are reasonable and his work is professional.
5,Josh was prompt and professional. He called ahead to let me know when he was coming. He was on time and completed the work exactly as promised and cleaned up the bathroom following the job. Great service.
5,It worked out really well. They did a very professional job and it was exactly what we needed. I rated it highly.
5,It worked out really well. There were no extra fees. They did a very professional job. It was exactly what we needed.
5,"Josh and his assistant were great! I was very impressed with him as he gave me a time to meet him at my house and he was actually there a minute early. He gave me a fair estimate and I accepted. He showed up at my house (again on time) and completed the work when he said he would and it looks great! My wife was hesitant about strangers being in our home when we weren't there, but Josh is very trus...

5,"Excellent. They arrived exactly on time, completed the work efficiently and well. I will definitely use them again."
5,"These guys were great. I had really only planned to have the shower caulk removed and recaulked and that would have been worth the $75 to me but they told me that wouldn't take 2 hours so we added 2 tubs caulking to the original job. Since they were here and I had another thing I needed fixed, I asked if fixing a pocket door would be something they would be able to do. Of course they could and the...

5,"Meticulous removal of old caulking with new razor blade for each room. Perfect new caulking, deep and neat. A true craftsman and artist with a caulking gun. A great value with so much accomplished for such a reasonable cost. I will never try caulking myself again."
5,"Joshua arrived on time and went right to work. My husband and I were amazed at how quickly and expertly he performed the job. This is an older home and neither the floor or walls are level or square. Joshua efficiently made adjustments to make the cabinets and countertops work without additional expense to us. I had ideas that weren't the easiest to execute but Joshua completed the task without co...

I was out of town and impressed that he had everything done so quickly and we...

5,Joshua and his helper quickly moved through my projects. They were very professional. I'm having them back to install screen door when it's delivered.
5,"They did a great job! There were no additional fees associated with the Big Deal, not even for materials. The guy who comes out is easily available and does what we ask him to do. He is professional at caulking bathrooms and his pricing is great on Angie's List."
5,"He was efficient, nice, attentive. He did what I asked and it was quality work"
5,"I was allowed to use the coupon that I had purchased from Angie's list, but due to the problem, the cost was higher. Both men were professional, courteous, and respectful. The job was explained as what needed to be done and its cost. Only wish that I had was that they had provided and installed a new tub drain mesh as well."
5,Everything turned out well. They showed on time and did the work as promised.
4,"It was good. He was a pleasant guy, did good work, and did a good job. He looked good and cleaned up. He took him about six hours and probably paid him an extra thirty dollars."
5,The drain cleaning ran into a hiccup with piping what was in poor condition. The gentleman took extra time and repaired the piping.
5,Joshua was very nice to work with. He arrived promptly and went right to work on cleaning grout around our two tubs. He applied caulking where needed. He also applied a layer of silicon seal to finish the project. We are very pleased with the finished project. He also did a nice job cleaning up when he was finished.
5,"We just wanted to hire someone who is dependable and is good at what they do. After looking at his reviews, we decided to hire him. When we contacted him, he was able to come out on a Saturday to provide an estimate. He ended up being able to complete the work on the same day. It turned out really good and it looked much better after he completed the work. We are going to be calling him to install...

4,Josh arrived exactly as scheduled and went right to work. He was a very pleasant young man and a pleasure to have in our home. He regrouted the shower and caulked where needed. He also caulked around the tub and vanities without being asked.

4,"Service came out and previewed work requested and approved list. The work done was done well, except for the ceiling fan. Fan was out of balance and needed to be cleaned and balanced. He worked on the fan for a long time, 3 hours, and no fan remote will not work. Spent a lot to time trying to fix a problem that wasn't the issue. He didn't carry a lot of tools, and had to make trips to get them. He...

5,The service provided by Professional Handyman worked out fine. I got the job done. He was quick and communication was fine.
5,He was on time. He did his work. He was clean. He gave us a good estimate. There were no complaints about it. Everything was fine.
3,"Our kitchen sink is badly clogged and they tried to unclog it but broke a pipe. The sink is still clogged, but I think that's mostly because our plumbing system is badly designed, so there's more work to do no matter what. My landlord was not happy with the results but I thought the father and son who came and fixed it were very nice people. If anything I think their customer service was great."
5,"Joshua did an excellent job. In fact, Joshua also put in a back yard fence, re routed gutters, and cleaned brick mortar for me. Also, when there were problems with the air conditioning, Joshua went right over, checked out and repaired the problems. I have been so pleased with Joshua's vast knowledge in diagnosing and repairing the home maintenance problems I've had this year. I would use Joshua in...

5,"He was very fast, friendly and efficient. He also seemed quite knowledgeable about all types of projects."
4,"I have used this provider three times. The first time, Josh did the work himself and he did a beautiful job. The bathroom looked great and the clean-up was immaculate. The next two times he had a new worker in training. The quality of the work was not the same, and I had to cleanup the excess grout myself. I would use this company again if Josh was doing the work himsef."
3,"Part of the work was of pretty good quality and part not very satisfactory. Not very good on cleanup or do over where needed. If I needed tile work done again other than the very simplest thing, I would hire a tile specialist. This contractor in my opinion is not in that category. A Very nice person, but the work as a whole was somewhat disappointing."
3,"It was okay. It was supposed to be 8 hours worth of work. It was not a direct 8 hours of service; they are allowed to bring somebody and split the time up. I didn't see that part. He came and said someone else was coming. I just thought it was a friend and didn't know that it was on my dollar, which it was. He did 4 hours and the other guy did 4 hours. I probably wouldn't use them again."
5,"He responded quickly to my emails and showed up on time. He came out to take a look at the job and then came back on 2 different dates to finish the work. This was great because the coupon we bought just covered 4 hours of grouting and caulking and he actually needed some thin set for the tiles in addition to grout and caulk. We are very pleased with the work. Turns out he's a widely talented ""han...

5,The person who came out was very prompt and very efficient. The price was appropriate. I'd absolutely hire him again.
4,I was looking to replace the missing and damage wood siding on my chimney. They seemed knowledgeable and they were professional. But I decided to use a local company instead. I will not use them in the future.
5,The repairman fixed all broken grout and cleaned shower. He did not however have the sealant and asked me if I had already purchased it. I was not aware that I had to. Other than that he did a great job. Will probably use him again.
2,"The handyman from Professional Handyman was on crutches when he got here and he brought somebody with him to take up the slack and I had purchased 2 hours of professional handyman service and I wanted a ceiling fan to be hung and it required me making a scaffold in the room so that they could work. He told me that it would take longer than 2 hours to hang the fan and he said he would charge an ext...

He called approximately 1 hour after his stated arrival time wanting to come in the sfternoon. I had already called someone else to do the repair due to rain forcast for afternoon.
1,"I don't think they were professional at all because they didn't write me anything out, that is what bothered me and when I questioned his prices and I ask him if he could please write me something out he went to the store and sent me pictures of the parts and prices. I thought that was ridicules and they he changed his prices. He said he way under quoted me but he still was pretty low so I was goi...

5,Overall this job went off without a hitch. No major snags and he took care of the minor ones.
5,He showed up on time and completed his work quickly and professionally. He cleaned up after himself and asked me to approve the work before he left. I was very pleased with his work and would contact him again for handyman types of work.
5,"Arrived on time, friendly, and efficient."
5,"Did a great job. Came out as promised. Dug deep to remove all signs of mold. Replaced grout and came back a few days later to caulk because grout hadn't dried yet. I appreciated that he didn't just caulk and I'd never have known. I had paid him for 3 hours and he had some time left and offer to replace caulk and grout around my tube. Again, I that wasn't part of our deal but I sure appreciated it."
5,"We originally bought 4 hrs of tile, grout and caulk work from one of Angies list specials. However, when Joshua came to do the work it was discovered that we had extensive water damage behind one wall in the tub area.

He did a beautiful job, balancing their placement perfectly and taking the time to make adjustments to make sure they were even. I would call him again for any work I need done."

We are thrilled with the results of Nate’s work and I highly recommend Nate. Nate exceeded our expectations, very timely, professional and he keep his work areas very clean and neat."

When I initially called him with a list of 4 'random' items I needed to have looked at (replace fence posts; replace a railroad tie that we have by our driveway; some siding repair & ceiling issues due to a previous leak), he responded within an hour. He came by later that evening on the way home just to look over the jobs and let me know what he would b...

5,Both jobs were well done and priced right. He is excellent.

When I reached out to him on a idea to shiplap the entryway, he was ready with solutions. From idea to execution took less than week. Nate is always responsive and reliable.

5,"Great work once again by Nate. He is a very rare example of providing top notch quality of work and customer service/responsiveness. Not surprisingly, when I first contacted Nate he told me he was backed up a couple of weeks, yet he continually followed up with me until we found a mutually convenient time for him to do the job. I would hire him again in a heartbeat."
5,Nate arrived on time and completed our entire less in less time than I believed possible. The quality of his work is superb. He is the best handyman we have ever used. We would use his services again and we recommend him without reservation.

5,Nate showed up on time. He did a very nice job and left the area as clean as if he was never there.. Highly recommended.

We have utilized the services of several handymen during the last 25 years.

He was able to work with a beautiful, yet pain in the butt, light fixture that I had bought for our dining room, and even had me come take a look before he s...

He called back within an hour saying he was around my part of town and could install them right away as whatever he was working on hit a snag and needs to wait for parts. Within an hour we...

He was just friendly, smart and hardworking guy. He's just the type of person you'd trust having in your house and he's making sure he's always doing the right thing.

5,Nate and I had to reschedule the first time around because I didn't have everything that was needed to move the first fan from a flat ceiling to a vaulted one. He was very punctual and professional and was able to complete the install in less than 2 hours. I would definitely recommend him!
5,"This gentleman was very professional, however, I decided to go with another company instead."

5,"Nate was on time, he listened to my requests. He installed both the light fixtures. It is hard to find handyman like him. I am absolutely using him again, for my next job."
4,"Nate was professional, timely and did good work. Three of the installations were very high. We rented a ladder which he helped my husband unload, load and bring back to the rental place.

I was very impressed with Nate, and will call him again for all of my future needs, and, being a Realtor, will refer him to my clients"
5,"Nate arrived on time, had everything he needed to perform the tasks we contracted. The ceiling light went up without a hitch in about 20 minutes.

5,"Very professional, responsive and he did a great job."
5,"Nate responded in an expedient manner to our request for a timely service. We had two jobs which had to be completed prior to our household goods being delivered to our new residence.

I highly recommend his services and we wi...

5,"If there was ever a ""perfect"" handyman experience this was it ! Honestly, after a string of ""Handyman Specials"" gone wrong or at best just barely OK.......This was PERFECT ! Response, punctuality, professionalism, everything just as it should be. Nate two fans down and installed two NEW fans in less than 2 hours. Very polite and respectful young man."
5,"Nate was a little backed up schedule-wise when I purchased the deal, which was fine, because I had a lot going on for a couple of weeks myself. He did reach out to me once when he had an unexpected opening the next morning, but I couldn't make the appointment work with my schedule. When my schedule started to open up, I gave him a call. We arranged a date and time roughly a week out. He texted me ...

5,On time and quick. I left the house and when I got back they were both up and working. Would use again!

He replied to all my emails very promptly. He called about 30 minutes prior to arrival, which is helpful to a busy mom who spends more time in her minivan than at home. After he installed one of the fans, I...

5,We have tall ceilings which was not a problem for Nate. Some places we called charged more for high ceilings. He had to make some adjustments to the brackets which he did with no problem. One of the fans was a little wobbly so he even came back out to fix it when he was in the area. I would not hesitate to recommend Nate.
5,"Nate was so nice. He fit us in at the earliest slot in his schedule, which was very much appreciated! Very professional, prompt and did very nice work. Will call Nate again for other work!"
5,"He did a great job. ALL of our fixtures turned out to be challenging installs, but he was able to get them all up. The chandelier is about 10 feet up in the air over the stairs landing and so he had to hang over the railing at the top of the stairs and balance himself on a ladder over the 10 foot drop to install it. If we need anymore lights installed I would definitely use him again."
5,"We initially bought the 2 fan installation but then decided to add additional work such as the dimmer and moving one fan to another room. He was very professional while assembling the units by cleaning up after each install and was very respectful of our home, and then he did the additional unexpected work without a fuss. He was promptly on time, very reasonable and competitive in his pricing, ple...

Not only will I use him again, but friends have asked for his number."

He was easy to communicate and schedule with and even came out twice because we discovered (when he was here the first time) that one of the sets of shutters was damaged and had to be re-ordered. He made multiple trips to home improvement stores to get the correct anchors and drill bits so that the shutters could be installed correctly (in brick) with t...

He was very polite and nice about the situation and told me to send you guys an email for a refund on the money. Tha...

5,"Nate was fantastic! Hard worker and smart. He had to install 2 fans in rooms with old electrical wiring and make it work. One room had a low ceiling and he had to figure out how to install a fan flush mounted - it was missing the original pieces for flush mounting but he figured it out. He reinstalled this fan after discovering the fan would be too low with the extension pole - he didn't complain ...

5,"He did great work. He called me within days of me buying the coupon and then, he came out and I had them install very high ceiling fans. He had all his own equipment. He is very clean, neat, and fixed actually another overhead nook because the siding has not aligned up right where he was putting it. He fixed that for me as part of the process at no charge. I just spent the $99 Big Deal."

5,Fantastic Job! Nate does a professional job!

5,"Nate was terrific. He called, we set up a time, he arrived on time, did the work, cleaned up, left. One of the fixtures was a bit difficult, but Nate solved the problem. He's also professional, polite and pleasant. We've got other projects for which I will be calling Nate."
5,"We spoke over the phone about the project, and after I explained what I wanted/needed done, he told me he had never done an electrical box swap. I appreciate his honesty, but have found someone else who is more experienced with that to do the project."

5,Great! Nate is the best and I am a very hard to please customer!

5,"We have done so much updating on our house for some reason we never followed through with some of the major lighting fixtures. That is, until we saw a special on Angie's List for two installations for $99. Always a bit nervous about hiring a handyman, because they're as hard to find as a good/honest mechanic. So, we checked out Nate on Angie's list and decided to take a chance and take advantage o...

The original ceiling fan was installed in a non-standard manner, but Nate used his extensive home-improvement experience to persevere. The results are impressive! I plan on hiring Nate for other projects around the house and highly recommend his work!"
5,From start to finish my experience with Nate was great! You can tell he takes pride in what he does and his finished outcome proves it. He was on time and worked efficiently. He was very courteous and made sure I was happy with his work. His prices were also very reasonable. I would recommend Nate to my friends and family and will use Updates By Nate in the future.

5,Great!
1,"Paid inspection fee for an estimate. First appointment was rescheduled and pushed a week out due to an estimator no longer being available at scheduled time. When an estimator finally did come out, inspection felt rushed and was not as thorough as other inspectors I had come out. Did not feel comfortable moving forward with service. Waste of time and inspection fee."
4,My job started about 8:30AM and ended about 6:00pm. Kevin and Marcos worked very well with each other and got the job done. They were also neet
5,"We were very happy with the work from Pablo and Mario and JWHI — they were professional, punctual, and did great work on a variety of handyman chores, from painting, to caulking to fixing doors and patching up a leaky roof. When new issues arose, they proposed and executed creative solutions. Really happy with the work."
5,The workers did an excellent job. Attentive and responsive to our questions. Excellent work.
5,"This is the fifth or sixth time we have used JW for home improvement projects, and we have never been disappointed. We started with 'simply' trying to find the source of water damage in our lower-level, and ended up renovating our laundry/storage room and installing new vinyl floors throughout the bulk of the downstairs. From Josh making multiple trips out to ensure the estimate and scope was soli...

5,"On-time, courteous, and professional. Thomas and Antonio did a great job. I would hire them again in a second."
5,"Excellent technicians, hard working, professional and friendly."
5,"I found JW Home Improvement on Angi's List. I had two other estimates, but they came in the lowest and gave excellent service. Side note: I didn't know the owner (Jessie) of the company came out to give me the estimate. He was very nice and worked with me on what I needed done and fit my budget. Chris Brown, the contractor, was on time and was very professional. He was able to do everything I need...

Alberto and Javier are truly master craftsmen. From removing load-bearing walls to installing cabinets to gorgeous tile work to painting and much more, they seemingly are able to do any task with perfection. They are also a delight to work wit...

All of the technicians were friendly, prompt, knowledgeable, respectful, highly skilled and operated efficiently...

5,"Co. responded promptly to my inquiry on Angi.com. Very cordial, professional. Cost quoted was outside of my desired budget but the rep. was nice, offered alternatives and thanked me for my time and consideration . Very professional."
2,"Disappointed that we can't hire JW to just do some quick handyman jobs around the house for 4 hours. They require an estimate first, then 6 weeks to schedule. The work doesn't need an estimate, we just need a handyman to work for 4 hours and get done what they can during that time. Will have to use another provider."
5,"Great. Oscar and Fernandez were prompt, considerate and very competent. The wall and the cabinet surrounding the water shut off match perfectly with the remaining wall. They covered all furnishing, designed appropriate shelving and cleaned up all remaining depre."
5,Alberto & Javir did a wonderful job at my home very experience in the task that each had to perform and very professional guys. And we did a walk throw at the end of the jobs to make sure that my Wife and I were Happy with there work. Great Job Bobby & Sandra
5,"We bought our townhouse knowing it was going to need a few projects done in the short term. One of those was the creaky, squeaky staircase connecting the main level to the upper floor. Several of the steps were obviously insecure, bouncing and flexing whenever we stepped on them. However, carpet covered the stairs so we could not see the full extent of the problem or the cause. We contacted three ...

5,"I cannot say enough positive things about Oscar and the team at JW Home Improvement. Oscar's abilities as a finish carpenter are the best we've seen in any home improvement project in our time in DC. He went above and beyond and demonstrated considerable personal pride in his work. He was an absolute joy to work with and we're grateful for the quality of the work he did to our home. We needed a 10...

5,"I originally hired JW last year to install a new subfloor in one of my bathrooms. The crew was punctual and very professional. Once they began demo for the floor, they noticed significant rot under the tub and were able to add that repair to the scope of work for a reasonable price. I was very satisfied with the quality of their work. On the strength of the bathroom work, I hired them again early ...

5,Good communication and got the job done quickly.
5,"Overall, very well. There were two pair of workers here over 7.5 days. The first did very good work, but had difficulty matching the stain of vintage woodworK (probably maple). Also they were average at clean-up. The second team was terrific, especially at matching the color and restoring the woodwork. They also did excellent repair/restoration and cleaned up well."
5,Job was performed well in less time than estimated.
1,Horrible service. Multiple phone calls made and emails sent without a single response. Poor customer service and I do not recommend this company.
5,"They did great work painting our extensive exterior wood trim, repairing a section of our fascia, and installing an outdoor light. The technicians and the JW main office were both a pleasure to work with. The great thing about these guys is that if they discover a problem, they can almost always fix it themselves, since they have all the relevant skills. We have hired them often in the past and wi...

5,"Our technicians (Marcos and Josh) did excellent work. Their craftsmanship was high quality, and they were truly a pleasure to work with. I definitely recommend JW if you have an old house with a lot of repair needs -- it may be more efficient to hire them to do several tasks at once, instead of hiring separate contractors. We will certainly be hiring them again."
5,The JWHI technicians did a great job with my list of repairs. They were professional and communicated well. Would absolutely hire again.
5,"This was our second experience with JW and we anticipate additional work. The entire process from estimation to scheduling, implementation, and close-out was very smooth, with excellent back office support. As the work progressed, we added some additional handyman chores that needed attention. Oscar took a very thoughtful, creative, cost-effective approach to our project, part of which involved as...

5,"Excellent workmanship, efficient, and a pleasure to work with."
5,"So please that I went with JW. The side entry porch had rotted wood throughout and the steps were sagging. Also, exterior house paint had been removed years ago but prior owners did not address one side of house, probably cause it was hidden behind crepe myrtles. Crepe myrtles are now gone and that wall is very visible on the street. Also there were some little jobs needed around the house such as...

JW did very thorough work, all issues fixed/repaired, new access door installed, and finished product works great. While a bit costly on an hourly rate basis, you pay a premium for quality, which is always worth it in the long run. wou...

5,"I have used JW Home Improvement on three or four jobs for my home. The quality of their work is uniformly excellent. Their employees are courteous, thorough, and professional, and they always clean up well after completing a job. While they are not the cheapest handyman service in town, you get what you pay for. The only area where they could use some improvement is with their invoicing/billing pr...

I used JW Home Improvement several times at my old home and have received excellent service every time. All jobs, including this one, are completed quickly, affordably, and with very high quality. I highly recommend anyone with a specific need or a list of needs contact JWHI to get help!"
1,"The guy who came to give an estimate wasn't qualified to diagnose any of the problems I presented to him, and ended up giving the worker the wrong direction on our repairs, wasting two months of our tenants time and much too much of our money with no results. 1. We had four different kinds of problem to fix, and the estimator in trying to ""save us money"" wanted to book the one guy they have who ca...

They didn't cut any corners and the final product looks like it has been part of the house ...

5,"There are not enough superlatives to describe the wonderful work that JWHI did on our home. We called them in because our house desperately needed to be painted, some key exterior repairs were required, and the gutters needed to be replaced.

5,"We have worked with JW Home Improvement for a number of (8) hour days over the past few months. We staged new light fixtures, switches, and plumbing fixtures and JW sends the right person who removes the old fixtures and installs new fixtures over (8) hours. This strategy has worked well and we have brought back JW 3-4 times over the basement remodeling project."
5,The contractor did a beautiful job with a somewhat complex installation of crown molding in basement to cover some electrical -- it required him to work around windows and tiny corners. it looks amazing.
1,"Excellent job by Thomas Motamoros and Apolo Gonzalez at JW Home Improvement. These men were punctual, neat, well-mannered, and skilled carpenters and painters. The job site was always clean and orderly, and the work was excellent. They performed beyond my expectations."
5,Jeff Dahlgren (JW Home Improvement) did an Excellent job for us with high quality work and budgeted project time very efficiently.

Alejandro and Alfredo were professional, courteous, and consistently checked in with us as the work was being performed to ensure we were happy. We will definitely hire JW again in the future."

5,Very well. Staff was very responsive (emails ore phone calls). I was impressed.

5,"Outstanding! My technician was Apollo, and I will most assuredly request him to replace my other two doors. He was great. I was very well pleased! Thanks"

We had them screw in the ceilings in three bedrooms and the hall as well as fix large vertical cracks in several rooms. They put screws in the ceilings a foot apart along all the joists.

He offered excellent suggestions and communicated well throughout ...

Technicians were punctual, neat, kept me fully informed on the project, and even asked if I needed anything when I wasn't feeling well.

5,"The technician -- Angelo -- arrived on time, clearly knew what he needed to do, was efficient, and very friendly. Also, the staff in the office were very easy to work with, and were good about keeping me informed of the schedule for my work. I will certainly go back to JW for additional work."

5,Efficient and looks great. He was done at low end of the estimate and able to get a promo offer for a price reduction.
5,"From start to finish, a pleasure to work with. Juan Martinez did an excellent and professional job and our ceiling looks like new. Also, in these trying times, he was very careful about mask wearing as well as very meticulous about cleaning up at the end of each work day. Would highly recommend."

5,Great! 2 handymen were extremely knowledgeable and professional. They worked diligently and followed our directions. All of their work was perfect and just what we wanted.
1,A waste of 50 dollars. They never itemized my request. Tried to charge me one lump fee. Horrible
5,The entire process went smoothly from scheduling to the actual work performed.
5,"Excellently, from the original estimate (very clearly explained in terms of costs, time and cost structure) to the excellent team of Cesar and Luis who performed the work beautifully and on time (finishing a bit earlier than we thought it would take, actually.) We would rehire JW in an instant for future work, highly recommended."
5,"Handyman repairs around the house. All work went as discussed, tradesmen came on time, we’re kind, courteous, and knew how to do the work they were asked to perform. They wore masks and booties all the time and were highly respectful of the Covid distancing. We would definitely hire again. It was a good experience!"
5,The job was completed but the paint was still wet so it smeared and there were some other details that needed to be addressed. I contacted the project manager and he was very professional and apologetic. He sent out a tech to correct the details and now the door looks great. Great customer service!
3,"JW's representative came to our residence to give us an estimate. At that time they had a ""special"" whereas they would supply all of the supplies required, I would only pay for the labor. After he left, I realized that the ""special"" was not included in his estimate. I also recalled that this was the same gentleman who I had previously filed a complaint against. I immediately contacted their office...

5,"Excellent work! Kevin was on time and respectful regarding mask wearing. He was super professional, worked efficiently, and did very high quality work!"
5,Great! The crew did a wonderful job. They were focused on the task and very professional. I was able to get the work done quickly and greatly appreciate their time and efforts. They were very neat and fully completed each task. They have a high sense of pride in their work. I highly recommend JW Improvement for home repair and fix-it work.
5,"The JW painters (Thomas M., Juan M., and Kevin) arrived promptly as scheduled; worked exceptionally efficiently (completing the project in half the estimated time); and produced a high quality paint job on our house windows. I am a repeat customer and will continue to rely on JW for any home project."
5,"The technician, Jose, did an excellent job. He was professional, timely and efficient. He understood what i needed, purchased the necessary material quickly and installed it in an timely and efficient manner. I had used this company previously and would not hesitate to use them again when necessary. I recommend Jose and this company highly."
4,Work completed competently. Unfortunately the price was exceptionally high for the work.
1,"This is an update to a previous review where I rated JW low because the price was significantly higher than the original quote (nothing unexpected occurred during the job) but I rated them high for quality of work. During a conversation with the worker, I commented that I wasn't happy about the new price of the job and the worker, who was very nice, said ""I understand but I can assure you that the...

5,"Alfredo and Chris did outstanding work around my house's exterior - 4 solid days of work July 2020. They were prompt and professional, with coronavirus safety-distancing and masks, and worked very hard even though the temps were 90+ degrees every day! Excellent work, and I will request them again for my Fall repairs. Thank you!"
5,The work went as scheduled with some additional work done on 2 exterior windows that were leaking rain water when it rained causing interior damage to the walls.
5,Very smoothly; it did go a bit longer than the original estimate but since they were to use what parts of the deck that were still in good shape while rebuilding we found more damaged wood than could be seen before the deck itself was disassembled.
5,"JWI crew was outstanding. They were professional for 6 1/2 days of work while I was home. They were very neat and completed high quality work. They really did a beautiful job for me with a very long list of work, including some more complex repairs."
5,"I highly recommend JW Home Improvement. From their call center to their repairmen, they are highly professional & do an excellent job."
5,We were very pleased with the work done. The price was reasonable and the technician was excellent. I’d definitely recommend them!
5,"I've hired JW in the past with great results. This time, the contractor, Jeff Dahlgren, was great. He worked for several hours in the heat and kept a cheerful attitude. He also went the extra mile and fixed a vent that was not part of the original work, just because he was able to. Highly recommended."
5,"Thomas and Antonio were very accommodating and efficient with the work they performed on our house. They repainted our front porch, pressure washed the siding and deck, repaired loose panels around the deck, and repaired/painted the railing to the basement. The quality of the work was high and they were able to answer all of our questions along the way. Would definitely hire again."
5,"Outstanding! Can’t go wrong with Miguel Cabrera. He did an excellent job. And the clean up afterward was great. Would not hesitate to request him for any paint job. I’m pleased with his professionalism, job skill, and his attention to detail. Thanks Miguel"
5,"JW’s technician identified the problem, replaced pipes. He also replaced flooring. He did a meticulous job. He worked quickly thus saving me money. He kept me apprised of the steps in the project. His work solved my plumbing leak issue and my the flooring that he laid down is incredible. I would recommend JW to all my friends and neighbors and would use their services again without hesitation."
5,"Very easy to schedule, to arrange, to change plans. The technician was early and the work was excellent. I highly recommend them."
5,"Very well. Kevin and Antonio showed up on the date promised, were punctual every day, worked steadily, cleaned up after themselves, did quality work and completed the job ahead of schedule saving us some $$."
5,Great. Caesar's work was very well done and efficient. Would hire him again.
5,Great! The crew was professional and friendly. Showed up on time and worked hard. This is the second time I've used JW. They're my go to contractor now.
5,"I am very pleased with the results from William and Apolo. William knew exactly the type of screening I was looking for and was able to order and install it. They replaced the screen door and some rotten wood, as well as repainted the porch. During the process, they kept me informed on the progress, The quality of work was very good."
5,"The process went very well. Jesse arrived promptly to give an estimate and explained everything when I had questions. Alberto and Javier were very accommodating, including going back to the hardware store when I explained that I had goofed and left off one part of the design. I did need to point out that I had requested painting, but they got it done quickly. Result: Strong, sturdy construction of...

5,"Excellently! Even though this work occurred during the Covid 19 crisis, JW staff were on the job. They performed several small jobs around the house including finishing our floors to our basement, patching damaged /touching up paint from moving in to our house, changing out our bathroom sink, fixing a leak in our bathtub, and installing a screen on our fireplace. We left the house during the work ...

5,Great. Very responsive to my initial call for an estimate. Very thoughtful and reasoned review of the work that needed to be done. Good suggestions regarding proposed solutions. Work crew was terrific. On time. Detail oriented. Offered frequent updates on status of the work. Work was completed on schedule. High quality workmanship. Left the site clean. Will definitely use JW again.
5,"We have used JW Home Improvement twice before and were very pleased with their work and the whole experience, so we had no hesitation to hire them again. Jesse estimated the work, gave us options, and we decided what would be done. On the first day of work, Duvis and Denis arrived promptly. We showed them the areas where work was to be done and one went to purchase materials while the other starte...

5,The workmen arrived timely and worked steadily. They were polite and friendly. They offered good advice about several items.
5,"I have used JW Home Improvement in the past and contacted them for an exterior painting/repair project. Josh, the estimator, was on time, walked through some issues he found with my exterior (wood rot and replacement of siding on the outside of my gas fireplace due to weed wacker damage, and leak in same area) in addition to the painting. I had a two-person team (Thomas and Matthew) for two days t...

4,"They did a pretty good job. There was an issue with the scheduling but overall it turned out as a decent job done. Communications went well. They did come late and stayed late. They left off some screws from the old door and did not put all the screws in with the new door. It wasn't a simple job, but when I brought this to their attention, they did come back and made it right. I would hire them ag...

For floorboard repair, Justin was very thoughtful and cautious about complications o...

5,"Second time using JW Home Improvement. Great representation by owner Jesse during initial estimate. Listened to what we wanted done and offered suggestions on how to handle efficiently. Scheduling was a breeze. The crew (Ramond, Thomas, and Denys) were timely, knowledgeable, professional, and a pleasure to work with. Projects (foam board insulation in basement ceilings and walls; laying flooring i...

5,Outstanding! Brandon is an excellent craftsman and took a very outdated bathroom to the next level; superior job!
5,"They are fantastic, the workers are polite, they explained what they are doing, how they are doing and always prompt. I'll plan on using them again."
5,"Thomas and Apolo were great. They showed up on time, were respectful, asked questions to clarify project requirements and kept their work areas clean/cleaned post project. They did a great job on putting together a quality product. JW Home Improvement is a tad bit pricier and I'm sure you could get cheaper quotes but the extra expense is worth it if you want quality and great customer service."
5,Excellent. Luis and Cesar did a great job. They arrived on time and went right to work. The completed the jobs well and early. I am satisfied and will use this company again. I have used this company on several previous projects with great outcomes.
1,"Not well -- I have had JW do some work in the past and they were great. I got a special on angies for 4 hours of work and paid for it through angies. JW sent out their handyman -- Justin -- and he worked for me for the allotted 4 hours doing minor things, such as hanging curtain rods, changing outlets, etc. within that 4 hour window. I supplied all the materials. That has now changed even when you...

5,"Very well. Johan and William were excellent in all respects. Very professional, very helpful and very diligent."
1,"A terrible repeat experience. The work is decent when they actually show up and are available. After being a repeat customer for years, they completely took our loyalty for granted. Scheduling and price estimates are a nightmare. Angie’s List is a big place. Save your money and time by skipping JW Home Improvement."
1,"We had used JW on a prior job and while not cheap they were outstanding. Our experience on this job was opposite (messy, overcharged, rude and failing to complete work). It was simple - insulate the doors to the house, fix a fan, install a couple of overhead lights. I paid a large down payment of about $1984 based on an estimate range of $1984 to $2884 depending on level of effort for 2 people, tw...

Alberto and Javier fixed everything and cleaned up after themsel...

5,Work was high-quality. Workers were on time and very professional. Very pleased with the workmanship!
3,"Company charges $50 for estimate -- good toward cost of job if you choose them. I chose not to pay for an estimate and will look elsewhere. The ""C"" rating and hire again ""no"" response are not relevant -- I just could not submit the review without checking something."
5,"Tough job in a confined space but precisely and professionally completed in estimated time. Thorough clean-up done at end of each day, and great care taken to avoid tracking-in or damaging home."
5,Fabulous job done!! Thomas Motomoros and Apolinario Gonzalez who did the job are accomplished craftsmen and true miracle workers. Thank you again for your efforts!!
5,The only wait was for the door (which had to be custom manufactured due to our front door's dimensions). The work was quick and to their usual high standard (I have used JW three or four times now). It actually came in under the estimate.
5,Excellent service and workmanship. Will work with this group again the next time I need a contractor.
5,"We originally had four items on our list. Jesse came out for the estimate and did a quick inspection of the exterior and found several items that needed to be addressed. We ended up having the team tackle all the additional items so they wouldn't turn into bigger issues later. Other than a delay in the start day and a hiccup on the first work day, the job went well. Alberto and Javier were pleasan...

2,"This is the third project I have had JW work on at our house. The quality of the work is excellent and the workers are first-rate and punctual. However, this time the project ran 18 hours over the labor noted in the estimate. I was out of town when the project was completed and never received a phone call alerting me that the project cost was increasing. Thus, I did not authorize the overrun. I si...

1,No go. They want $55 to do an estimate. No refund for a very bad estimate. They only refund if they do the job. Bad deal.

5,"Extremely well. First, the company was transparent and gave me a fair estimate before the work. We scheduled a time and day and Clifton Allen and Kevin Judd werfe on time, professional, worked right through a hot and humid day, and the work was beyond expectation.

He was able to diagnose the source of the mold which was from moisture seeping in through the concrete block wall of my house. It was a much bigger job to remedy the problem than originally estimated, which required sealing the entire outside wall, but Clifton and JW were able to finish the job in the original time al...

5,"The project was located at under the deck with very limited access. Justin Sellers had done a great job replacing damaged exterior board even though the only way to do that is to crawl and lie down for many hours.

5,Very well. Work was thorough and professional.

They even came back to do some additional fixes to make sure that no water would get in. They also rebuilt a wooden trellis that was slowly rotting, so they did a large amount of work."
5,The work was excellent and the drywall technicians were very professional (and punctual).
5,"Workman was professional, neatly dressed, on time. Did all the work as directed and needed. No pressure to do more. Not cheap but fairly priced for excellent workmanship"
5,"Done exceptionally well; professional on the the part of the crew was outstanding; deck was power washed, repaired and then stained to meet HOA requirements. Will use again; am a satisfied repeat customer."
5,It was good. My only problem was he had to go to home depot. Which took up much of the time of the deal. He did not come prepare. But did not charge me for it. I will used them again.

Overall the workers were fantastic. The price ended up being a little higher than was quoted, but that is partially due to the extra time they spent on the extra work."
5,"It went well. The workmen were punctual, efficient, considerate. I tried not to hover, but when I passed by they were always willing to address any questions or comments I had about the work in progress (or done). I had a good idea what I wanted when they started, but was prepared to compromise if my expectations proved too difficult or expensive to execute. Happily, the results exceeded my expect...

The workman stained/painted the replacement boards in both locations to match the original wood. The results look excellent. All work was completed within one day, as estimated, and within the estimated cost."
2,"I would never hire them again. The estimator wrote down the job incorrectly and the carpenter spent hours trying to replace a part of our door that was in good condition until I asked him why he was doing this. Then, a lot of back and forth with some administrators whose solution was to gift me the time of the carpenter for doing the wrong job which was a pain as I took time off of work to stay wi...

5,Excellent. Happy with the installation.
5,"The guys were prompt and professional. Always arriving on time and I really appreciated the neatness after each days work. Drywall dust can be very troublesome, but these guys took care to cover up furniture, etc and did an excellent job overall. I would definitely use them again."
5,"Fabulous! They were reasonably priced, punctual, clean, and the work was done in the time promised. The engineer/PM kept checking on progress and kept us informed every step of the way. We've gone through several handymen, none of whom performed as promised, but we now have our go-to company. 10 out of 10."
4,This was a failure on the part of Angie's List. The company responded that I was outside thier area.

5,"Two most friendly JW carpentry members, Thomas and Oscar, came to make repairs on damages on wooden parts of my porch and on the door of a garden shed (all damages were weather related). Then they changed two panels of screens on my porch. The labor cost is somewhat on the high side. But such an expense is well justified by the depth of their expertise and the energy they exerted into their work. ...

5,"Thomas and Brandon arrived on time (even early) both days. They did an excellent job of painting trim and two sets of doors. A visitor even thought the trim was newly installed. They took care of everything planned but were able to substitute one job for one that was not needed after all. All in all, both were very congenial and easy to work with and did excellent work."
3,"The work was completed on time and on budget but enough problems arose that I doubt if I'd use JW again. I should have known better when the estimator, on his first and only visit to my house, put pressure on me to accept their estimate on-the-spot. That was a huge red flag but I was in a hurry and the quoted price wasn't crazy, so I signed. But be warned: JW's estimators will pressure you. Things...

In spite of all that they never responded, going all the way back to Feb 22 til now they never so much as sent a text.

5,"Alberto and Javier were at my house for 2.5 days. I work from home, so I was surprised how quiet they were...that's good because I live in a condominium community with strict rules about noise levels. They worked tirelessly and took care in everything they did to make it look as good as possible. I'm much further along toward selling my home. Thanks again JW!"
5,"I've had a number of projects done by Jesse/crew. The work was always completed on time and they were definitely very efficient. Work had to be done on exterior of house and the garage ceiling needed improvement, several new light fixtures and some siding had to be fixed. The crew is great and always friendly. I will call them should small or large projects come up. I recommend JW for anyone."
5,"It went well. I paid for two workers for 8 hours. The crew that came was able to get a lot accomplished in that time. They did some blocking to prep the ceiling, hung the drywall, and taped the joints. I had done a lot of the work up until that point myself, but didn't have the ability to do the ceiling work (needs two people). I thought the hourly rate for the crew seemed high, but they did accom...

5,"Alfredo and Pedro arrived slightly early, were cheerful, efficient, and did a good job. I would be happy for hire them to do future work. I have used JW before and had a similar experience with the quality of the company's staff."
5,Bill and Justine did a great job and addressed all the issues quickly.
5,"Cesar and Luis showed up on time and worked consistently to clear our attic of excess insulation from a previous project and then cut and nail the plywood flooring. Because of wiring, they had to notch the wood to make the flooring fit snugly. They were unable to finish in one day because of the asbestos, but arrived the following morning to finish the job and were done by noon. The cost was high,...

5,"Kevin appears to have done an excellent job. I called Friday, they came out and did the work the Saturday, and I repainted Sunday."
5,"We are repeat consumers with this company — they are great. They worked with us on the schedule and, critically, they send very competent handyman. I had a tricky project — create a removable hatch door to reveal the ceiling-mounted heat pump in an upstairs closet. How to do this so that it was sturdy but not too expensive was the trick. I trust these guys and told them what I wanted and let the h...

5,"At first I had issues with the work and the number of hours charged, however Brian at JW called me to listen to my concerns. After understanding what my issues were, he went above and beyond to resolve these issues. JW does high-quality work and charges consistently with that type of work. I will definitely use them in the future and definitely recommend them."
1,I was told over the phone that I didn’t count as a previous customer because I never had work done. So I was sent an email with a false claim for an estimate discount. They have lost my business and I will be telling our neighborhood group as well to avoid this hoity toity company that obviously cares more about getting their estimate fee than actually serving customers.
5,They gave an estimate for time and cost and both were reasonable. The work was professionally done and they were friendly and efficient.
1,Poorly. Estimate made was high. Refundable deposit was not refunded. This company was purposely misleading in my opinion.
1,"This was our second use of the JW Home Improvement. The first time experience was wonderful. They were professional, did the job within agreed time and price, so we hired them again. This second experience was the polar opposite. We were seeking handyman services, but the estimator from JW turned each item on the list into a major job. We ended up with a coupon that we'd paid for, but no handyman ...

5,"This is the second time we've had JW out to do some work . First time, they were great. The price is slightly higher than other quotes we got (as with our last job), but for communication and quality, a modest price difference is worth it for us. On this job, we had four tasks, 2 of which were quite involved in terms of time needed to do them well. Alberto and Javier finished up today. Over 2.5 da...

1,"I paid for and scheduled an estimate to be made. I was to meet the contractor at the home at 12:00 pm to 2pm timeframe. I carefully explained to the scheduling agent that It would take me over an hour to arrive at the home from my work and that I would not have a cell phone available to me; thus the contractor would not be able to contact me the day of the estimate. I did leave my work number with...

5,Very well. Handyman performed precise measurements and rehung when necessary. Dispatcher worked diligently to get the serviceman out in timely manner.
1,They emailed like 10 days after the inquiry with a very large quote. Total waste of time. Have not been able to successfully hire anyone from Angie’s list yet
5,"This project was a big and very difficult challenging repair. The team from JW Home Improvement did a great job assessing the problem, identifying solutions, and solving the problem. Their repair team was professional, hardworking, and detail oriented. The communication was great. I will definitely call them in the future."
5,"It was a great job. I've used JW Home Improvement before for inside small jobs. The estimate was well within the average for the job. The crew that came to do the removal of the old gutters and install the new system was terrific. Mr. Thomas Matamoros was the crew chief with assistance from Kevin and Gary. They arrived on time, worked hard and finished the job in the estimated time. Of great help,...

JW came in, repaired the walls, re-installed the gutters and repainted. After only three days, the three rooms looked new again! I couldn't be more appreciative of everyone involved; great team, consummate professionals and always completing the...

4,"The estimate process was frustrating and clear as to job price or labor/materials. Then when I communicated and signed doc next day, no call back. Once I got their attention things improved. As for the actual technicians, Fernando and Jesus, they were the best. Knowledgeable and had to make all the correct adjustments for proper installation which estimator did not take into account. The stair rai...

3,"Site visit was punctual and service call agent was professional and helpful, but I haven't received an estimate yet, so don't know if I'll use them or not, so can't rate. It's been a week, which I don't believe is unreasonable amount of time, so I'll wait a few days longer and see what happens. Winter is coming and I do want to move on my project, so I can't wait much longer."
5,They were upfront and honest that it was a unique job that would be a high quote for them. They provided a reference for someone they felt could do a better job for less. Appreciated the honesty
5,"He was prompt and efficient, addressing all of the problems in a short amount of time. At his suggestion, I replaced the battery in the doorbell, but there are still issues. I will happily employ him again to resolve those problems. His understanding of how the doors were supposed to operate and how to make adjustments to each, depending on the specific problems was excellent. And he could not hav...

5,Excellent. Better than I had hoped.
5,"Fabulously! Jose and Chris did a great job! Jose's work on the interior garage door was absolutely wonderful! He found and fixed the problem, saw another problem with the door handle and fixed that, and when he was done, everything looked better then it had in years!

5,"This was my first experience with JW Home Improvement, though I have a LOT of experience with other contractors for a host of problems and home renovations, including many unexpected problems. I used them based primarily on Angie's List positive reviews, so I want to leave one to help others. Overall, I was satisfied with their service and would use them again. At the same time, there were a few s...

However, they did exactly...

The company went out of their way to schedule us before the holidays AND made sure to put the right employee on the job for the work to be ...

2,"It was a total waste of my time and money. There is a mandatory payment of $50 for providing estimates, of which I have not yet received. More importantly, they were not able to do the core work I really wanted done, even though I had previously sent a punch list of my work items."
5,"These guys were super prompt. They were on time, returned calls, and gave good estimates. The best part was that the technicians working on the house would text me with updates of completed work. They would send me pictures of completed work. They offered advice on other things that could be fixed to ensure top dollar on our rental. They were NOT pushy if I declined advised services. I would hire ...

The work they did was superb,...

5,"Very well. Thorough and knowledgeable. Wrought iron, front rail, exposed to street and passersby. Looks like new."
2,"After arriving an hour late, and pre-charging me $50 for an estimate, the representative for the company gave me an estimate of $420-$680. Two days later, I received an estimate of a flat $680. I asked for an itemized statement and an explanation of services. I am still waiting on that."
5,"Thomas Matamoros is outstanding! He arrived on time and complete all 7 projects...(new porch light, house numbers, mailbox, flag pole, a/c installation, fire alarm installation)...and more than the great quality, he was cheerful and pleasant all 6 hours. He is an 'A+' handyman and we appreciate his hard work."
5,Technician knew more than a prior electrician. Fast worker.
5,"All went smoothly. The estimating process (with Josh) was great, and JW provided a detailed and conservative estimate on cost and time. JW was able to schedule during a time when it worked for us, which was challenging as we were in the middle of moving. The guys who showed up to perform the work were diligent and focused. They worked so efficiently they were able to get some of the lower priority...

The rep said she would get back to me within 30 minutes, she did not. When I called I was told she had departed for the day.

4,Finished job turned out very well. Workers were skilled and professional. There was a glitch in ordering the window when the original JWHI estimator quit mid-project which put us several weeks behind schedule.

5,They were very excellent. Superb work. Recommend promotion.
5,The only problem noted was a lack of communication unless initiated by me. The work provided was excellent.
5,"Jesse Wertjes responded promptly to my request for an estimate for work. He examined the areas in question, explained options and provided me with a quote. Major work was scheduled and the work crew arrived on schedule. Work included removing rotted wood trim on exterior door and replacing with new wood, priming and painting, caulking. Other work included installing a new exterior light fixture, r...

On the originally scheduled date for the work to be done (a Friday), workers did not show up during arr...

1,Had an estimate done and decided not to proceed due to the inflated cost of service and the little work that was offered for the initial deposit amount. Despite repeated emails I have not received a refund of the $400 I paid as a deposit. I would not use Angie's list again for a service like this and we recommend that everyone beware of them 'disappearing' once they take your money.
5,"This was our first experience with JW. They were punctual in reaching out to set an appointment time. The estimator they sent, however, was unprofessional and off-putting. He made several weird comments during his visit to evaluate the work we needed to do, and was transparent in his efforts to inflate the cost of the job because I was a woman at home alone. When I called him on it and made it cle...

Our only complaint is that the office did not return calls or communicate with us in...

4,"Took much longer than expected, and nearly double the estimated cost per the submitted proposal. End result was satisfactory, but would be reluctant to engage again."
3,"The original handyman they sent was unable to compete the job. It was bid as a one man job but really was a two man job. They had to return several days later and our roof was left without its full support over the weekend. Luckily, there was no bad weather. Appropriately, they did not charge us for the sending out the second person because that was not in the original bid, and in the end the work...

We had a minor problem, not unusual for the many projects we had them do, w the window box and a ceiling having uneven paint---they quickly returned and took care of it. Their quality of work and responsiveness is excellent!"
5,very well - nice workers with professional behavior and knowledge
5,"Workers were punctual, professional, and all the work was perfect."
5,The repairmen called early and arrived at the beginning of the hour. They provided a quick overview of the work to be completed and provided recommendations. I provided materials prior to the work except gutter screws which were purchased during the allotted time. All work was completed professionally and within less time than quoted.
5,"As always, the crew was on time, did great work and did a great job with clean up. We needed our kitchen ceiling painted and Jesse was able to coordinate a team that did great work! I will ALWAYS USE JW Home Improvement for all my handy work needs!"
5,"Raymond and Thomas arrived promptly every morning for six days. They worked very hard, paid attention to detail, and did a wonderful job. They were always cheerful and were a pleasure to have around the house. We are very pleased with the work and recommend them very highly."
5,"All went well, except the animal problem persisted (there was another entrance), They did a great job in repairing the cause of the leak and repairing the internal drywall and even repainting."
5,Excellent work and finished at the time that was promised
5,"Everything went smoothly. The 2 guys were on time, knowledgeable and professional. Very happy with them."
5,"Very well overall, though the newly aligned gutter is leaking and I've had some trouble getting them to come back and adjust it. I'm sure they will, based on a good experience so far. Very professional and knowledgeable technicians."
5,"Justin cut the sheets of plywood and installed them exactly as I asked. He minimized the spread of dirt in our house. Justin worked steadily, understood my instructions, and was polite."
4,work done was performed in a friendly manner.

5,"Technician arrived on time, replaced drywall in stairwell and garage. Did a good job mudding/finishing the drywall. For the work accomplished, price was reasonable."
1,"It was frustrating. A team of four people came by a month before the work to walk through the house and provide an estimate on many things that were outside the scope of the deal and sell us on their great customer service. The technician who came was loud and sang the entire time he was there (I worked from home at the time so I couldn't escape it), he left for several hours during the day and we...

The job was quoted for $3,392 - $4,240 in labor. I was invoiced $6,612.45 - reduced from the original labor billing of $8,058.89 only after I pointed out obvious discrepancies.

The trim installed matched the pieces in the overall board replaced, but not the continuing trim. That is, there are three sections of trim on a door; two sides and a top cross piece. The cross piece was not painted to match (not must labor and no materials), but team was packed up to lea...

5,"Delayed arrival due to another emergency, but actually took money off the bill voluntarily for the delay, which I appreciated. Otherwise, work was done as expected."
5,Results were fine; but the time required and scope of the job turned out to be greater than anticipated.
5,"The work itself was excellent. My wife said the Tech was straightforward and honest about the work that needed to be done. We have a $30,000 back deck so spending about $800 to keep it in good shape was worth it."
5,Finished product looks great and functions just as well as I had envisioned. There was a billing error that I had to point out. They corrected it but it bugged me that they didn’t apologize for the error.
5,"Alex did a great job. He was courteous, neat and made sure the job was done right. I think this was a good deal offered via Angie’s list."
5,"I was not present while the work was being completed but the finished product was to my satisfaction. The two holes in the ceiling were repaired and the closest door was painted professionally. The quality of the work was good and according to reports, the employee was professional, respectful, and exhibited a good work ethic."

5,"The servicemen were prompt, friendly, and flexible."
5,JW Home Improvement was very responsive and my work was scheduled within days after the estimator was here. The price was reasonable and the guys who did the work were friendly and professional. I wouldn't hesitate to use them for other projects.
4,"The person they sent was very good. If they weren't so expensive I'd hire again. They price all their work by the hour, no matter the skill required for the task. I bought a deal where i paid for two hours but got four hours of work. The value was good for the discounted price but I wouldn't have paid $100/hour for caulking."
5,"He arrived on time and was polite. He assessed the wood that needed to be replaced then went to acquire the supplies at Home Depot. The 3 hours purchased included the time to go to Home Depot and return. Unfortunately, the 3 hours I secured was not enough, causing me to have to pay for an additional hour. The only reason I secured the service is because the rotting wood was too high for me to do m...

5,"After company rescheduling a few times, the job went great. The carpenter who actually did the work was excellent."
5,"This was a good quality experience from estimate to completion. Everything went on time and on budget. But what I really liked was the extra efforts on details, like making sure they matched the right wood for the deck even though it meant going to a second supplier, and putting the old boards into an organized stack instead of just piling them up."
5,Very satisfied with the work that was done. Highest recommendation!
5,"It went very well. The Customer Sales Rep first came out to do an estimate of what needed to be done. He was very prompt and answered all of my questions.

There was only one person and he did a great job, picked up materials for lattice but didn't have time to do any power washing., so I was a little disappointed. they should have estimated how much time it would have taken, because i really needed both done.

How can I pay $200 before even getting an estimate? What if I do not want to proceed after knowing the total cost of job? Am I going to lose my $200? Final word, I cancelled the voucher."
1,"Per Angie, a customer service representative, I was told that since I was an Angie's List customer, I would only have to pay the consultation fee of $130 and any materials necessary to install the doors. I was also informed that I could either have the contractors purchase the materials or purchase them myself. She also said I could also go with contractors to the store to get the materials; this ...

4,Good for the most part. But some of the cabinets that were repaired broke again quickly.
5,"Everything went well, but the total was higher than I expected."
3,"Buyer-Beware. I purchased the ""$49 for $149 worth of handyman work (3-hours of labor)"" deal off Angie's List. Despite the fine print which clearly states, ""The remaining balance of $100 is due to the service provider prior to work commencement,"" the receptionist could not, and would not, schedule an estimate unless I paid the $100 balance. Why would I go all in and pay $149 before even getting an ...

4,"Work was completed. Contractor did an estimate to replace planks and return to do refinishing. The new planks were installed with labels face up. Not sure if that was a lack of attention to detail or not. I do not know how much that matters once the project is complete. Contractor also left behind his blower. After I called the company to let them know, they said they would have someone contact me...

5,Excellent work. It looks beautiful.
3,"The quality of the work was fine, although since it hasn't rained much since the gutter work was completed, it's hard to know. However, the company quoted me an ""estimated"" price that was to be based on the actual number of hours it took to complete the work. It took fewer hours, primarily because the second guy who was supposed to be there the whole time was only there about half the time.Then th...

5,We were so satisfied with Cesar's work. He worked for 8 hours and got everything on our checklist completed. I don't even think he took a lunch break. He was very friendly and competent. I asked him about a few projects we are saving for a later date and he gave us some helpful advice. We will definitely use JW again and will request Cesar come back.
5,"The two men arrived promptly as promised. They worked on a variety of small projects from patching and painting a wall to replacing leaky faucets. All my ""chores"" were completed within the estimated time."
3,Deck waterproofed unevenly with a few spots missed
5,One light was very difficult to be done by a single handyman; therefore the company had to send another person to assist. They were very professional throughout the entire time and the office staff very professional and responsive to my concerns as project went over allotted time.
5,"Great! Oscar was punctual and neat. He was very careful with my schoolhouse lights. Two are pendant fixtures. He noticed that one was a little wobbly and he fixed it. One of the outdoor lights was a mess as bugs had gotten inside and died. He cleaned it out so it looks great now. He also fixed my garbage disposal which was not on the ""to do"" list. I had thought I would need to replace the disposal...

4,"The work went well. However, the handyman stopped early due to thunderstorms and I had to call back four times to get the work rescheduled. Once the owner got involved, they were out very quickly."
5,"The team JW Home Improvement sent to my house did a terrific job and went above and beyond my expectations. I highly recommend JW and will use it again. A little pricey, perhaps, but JW more than earned my money."
4,Workers prompt and efficient. Extremely proficient. Small problem I will report later. This was my 3rd project and I would use JW Home Improvement again.
5,"Very pleased with preview inspection and workers. One door a bit off kilter that I did not notice because I forgot to close while workers were still here. Living with it as my problem for forgetting to reschedule return. Neat, organized, careful of my home. The one odd cut was only problem. Four 38 yr old wood doors removed and replaced with white wood doors and handicap knobs. (Computer and Angie...

4,"I think the work was fine, but the (free) estimate was under half of the actual final cost."
5,"AWESOME! Chris was on time, professional, answered all of my questions and very neat. The repairs look so good and clean. Every interaction with company was great. Very satisfied with the service."
5,Excellent. All tools required the handyman had at site ready to go.
5,"The work was performed very well, and the staff on site clearly explained what was being done and how the work was progressing."
5,"The handyman, Chris Brown, was very nice, worked quickly, and cleaned up after himself. He got finished early and gave me a hand w/another small project."
5,The work preformed was excellent and the professionalism of the gentlemen that completed the work was sublime.
5,"They came timely, and did their jobs well. The major job was cleaning up some grout around the kitchen sink that had accumulated a lot of filth, and the job came out much better than I had expected."
5,"quality technicians, knew what they were doing"
5,"Great! Although there was a little bit of confusion at the beginning regarding what exact work needed to be done, everything went really well once that was sorted out."
5,"I thought the workers did an EXCELLENT job. They were punctual, worked extremely hard, and did a great job. JW was one of the only companies that was willing to come out to fix, but not entirely replace, holes in our siding. I give the quality an A+. I had a minor issue with the estimation being different from the ultimate invoice, but JW was very responsive to my concern and addressed it promptly...

3,"A little more attention to detail, house exterior was clean but could have been a little better."
5,"They were quite good. Yes, I would use them again. They were professional. They are very thoughtful and give you choices. Their communication is excellent."
5,Very impressed with work and the gentleman they sent to complete work. Very professional and work was completed in less time than originally thought. Would hire them again.
5,Work was done quickly and it was a beautiful job. Gentleman they sent was very professional. Would absolutely hire again. Great job.
2,"I did not like them at all. They cost by the hour. Thy ran really slow. They charge to get material at a store to get material. It cost way more than it should. The way the time was and the way they did things. I was not happy. They were very slow, and went to the store. They took like two hours. They were charging a $100 an hour. It was ridiculous. They gave me price that was ridiculous, and I go...

4,"JW Home Improvement charges by the hour. The estimator gave a low ball estimate, which was compounded by the fact that carpenters were incredibly slow. It took one employee about 4 hours to install a replacement slab door in a basement closet. The same employee also took about 3 hours to add hinges to a access panel to a sink’s water shut-off. Both projects should have taken less than 4 hours. Unl...

5,"workers were polite, very competent, and punctual."
3,I did not have them come to give me an estimate because I am getting multiple estimates and I didn't want to commit $50 when I might not use them.
5,He did a really good job. Responsiveness was a problem. I don't want to be bad but it was a problem. I probably would not use them again. I'd tell my friends and family to go somewhere else.
5,Wonderfully. I am so thankful that it is finished!!!
5,It went well. Employee was friendly and professional.
1,"It did not go very well. I ordered a ""deal"" -- 4 hours of rot restoration for $199. The deal was that I paid $69.35 to ""guarantee"" $199 for 4 hours of work. The remaining $129.35 was due ""directly to the service provider at time of service.""

5,I think they did a very nice job. They showed up on time. He was nice. The work turned out fine.
4,"He showed up on time. He was very easy to work with. Unfortunately he did not grout. There was a problem with the tub. We have used them a lot though, and would recommend."
5,"Excellent. Service was provided the same day that request was made at the ""no job too small"" two-hour minimum rate. Work completed promptly in a manner to preclude future failure (correcting a design flaw in the original installation)."
5,Very well. JWHI appears to be a bit costly but the quality of work is quite good to excellent.
5,"Great job. Very responsive, honest, reliable company."
2,"I didn't go that well. They were going to charge me an extra $150.00 to haul away the trash. I thought that should be part of the job. They charged me $150.00 for that, and it took them 6 months to complete the job. It was just a matter of replacing rotten wood on a bay window. It dragged on and on and on. They kept having excuses after excuses. It took them 6 months to complete- a solid 6 months....

5,Ok. The techs finished the first projects and were just trying to kill time texting but luckily I was checking in on them every 15 minutes. Sigh.
5,"They were unable to do the work because of structural issues with the house, but still charged for the whole time, which was really frustrating. However, I loved the company and the workers a lot - they were very nice and professional. Just super expensive."
1,"Terrible customer service. Told me it would take 2 guys, 2 days. Day 1 one guy shows up. I call the company and they tell me the other guys isn't coming but the guy I have is as good as 2 guys. So were they going to cheat me with 2 guys or lie to me about the guy they sent? I had put down a deposit for the 2 guys/2 days. It took me 6 weeks to get the money I paid back for the work that the one guy...

5,Well - ceiling still needs painting as part of another job to be scheduled
5,"Excellent service on the part of Justin and Francis. They arrived on time, did everything they needed to do in a highly efficient and professional manner."
5,It went extremely well. He fixed a problem that I had for a long time. He found a cracked valve that had water leaking through my house. I was just so excited that I finally had that done. He found the valve and replaced it. And I didn't have water leaking and didn't need to tear up my ceiling. I thought it was major but it wasn't. It was just that I didn't know.
5,Perfect. You can not tell it was worked on.
5,The entire process went very well and resulted in a professional job.
4,it went well. The person was early and did a good job
5,"The deck looks like new, safe and solid again! The stairs had rotted and several floor boards and railings were involved.

I had bought a coupon off Angie's list for 4 hours of Handyman services. I wanted to paint the small bathroom and replace the light fixture. Super easy. The first guy shows up and he starts painting and installed/uninstalled the new light fixture. He said the new light fixtu...

5,"Very well. I could not have asked for better quality, responsiveness of the contractor and their knowledge about deck repair. Their work clearly saved me from putting in a new deck."
3,"everything about dealing with them was great and the work done was good. my complaint is with the price. I had a coupon for a certain number of hours and I understood that I would pay hourly for additional time, but over $100/hour for this work seems excessive to me. additionally, while the estimator seemed knowledgeable, he did not do a good job of estimating the time. this would have allowed me ...

5,"The service went well. However, I found them expensive. The work was good, they did a good job. I might not have taken them on if I would've known how expensive they were going to be. It was so expensive, I only had them do the back deck, they didn't do the front. Based on price alone, I would not use them again. I thought the max for deck refinishing would be $2000."
5,"Very happy with them. They did a good job but they wanted us to buy the supplies, Like the grout for the tile. He did exactly what we asked him to do."
3,Took way too long to schedule Left a scuff mark on the living room floor moving equipment Left job without saying anything Way too expensive. Will never use again or recommend to anyone.
5,"Excellent job. Cost was more than I expected. Since I had already purchased the deck cleaning thru an Angie's List special, I was locked in with this vendor and had no other estimates. They wanted $2500 to coat the deck after cleaning, which I thought was high. I did it myself."
5,"Things went great. I used the $149 deal (for 3 hours of service). The men arrived and I had all parts painted so all they had to do was get busy and replace everything. They were able to do everything (and even caulk) in the 3 hours. I was very pleased to be able to do all of the preparing work (and have the shoulder/house jack) so they could just jump in on the job without delay. No need to pay c...

5,"Brilliantly. Alex was early, polite, meticulous, and super skilled. The repair job he did on the door, frame and surrounding walls (caused by elderly father's wheelchair) was miraculous. Far exceeded my expectations. And the work in the bathrooms made them look new. I would rehire him/JW in a heartbeat."
5,He came out and fixed some wood rot by cutting it out and replacing it. He did a very good job and I would recommend him to others.
5,They did an excellent job. You can not tell that it has been repaired. It looks like the original.
5,Very happy with the job Justin did! Will definitely hire again!
4,Painter was very courteous and professional. Job estimate was a bit off in time required and materials needed. My request to change type of work was accommodated easily. Wouldn't call again because of high prices.
2,"An estimator arrived to spot the jobs and put an estimate of time for completion. I won't go through every item but suffice it to say that I found it frustrating to hear for most jobs that the company would not do that particular work. In addition, the jobs they would do had what seemed unrealistic time frames, for example, 6-8 hrs to replace a toilet flush valve. The company has a very strict set...

5,"They sent someone out to assess the needs, which I really appreciated. On the appointed day, Chris called to let me know when he was coming. He arrived on time, and did a beautiful job. He was very polite as well."
5,"They were wonderful in terms of the pre-work service, but my condo association would not allow the balcony repainting because I was only renting. They claimed that the owner had to order the work and there were condo limitation on the work. Finally, no work got done and I was refunded all deposits."
1,I called Angie and got my money back. I cancelled the bait and switch deal.
1,It did not go. The company is irresponsible and should not be engaged for service. They did not respond to my scheduling requests.
3,Couldn't wait three weeks for an appointment. Cancelled purchase made through Angie's List and obtained refund.
5,"Great. Everything was fixed, and he found my missing earring under my vanity cabinet, too!"
5,"I have been happy with them, although they do not do free estimates. If you buy the deal from them through Angie's List, there is no estimate fee up front. They have been good for small handyman work and a few other services. I think they are more than capable for large projects, as they have quite a few teams."
5,"The workers at JW are professional, friendly and do an excellent job."
5,"The initial estimate went very well, but we ran into a bit of communication snafu with the second visit. This was easily fixed with a phone call and they responded very promptly. They performed excellent work and the shower and pan look fantastic!"
5,"Everything was fine, and they actually completed the work in less time that was anticipated. It all looks good and I have great hopes it will stand the test of time."
5,Great! I should have done this a year ago!
5,It was good. I only used them once.
5,"Very well, Carlos arrived at 8:00 am and was busy until 2:00 pm. Taking out old insulation, and the old vapor barrier and putting in the new, bagging it up and taking to curb for trash pick up. He also replaced the door hinges and reattached door to brick frame and painted the door."
5,The work was professionally done. Workers were knowledgeable and prompt. Cleanup was excellent. I would highly recommend this company.
2,"They have not responded to my emails requesting service. They have been paid, but have not contacted me to schedule service (other than the estimate). I am hopeful that they will get back to me this week so that we can wrap this up. I understand why they offer a deal for a specific service so that they can establish a relationship, but so far, this relationship is not going well!"
5,Really well. There were some bumps in the road just because we ran into some unexpected issues but they worked with me throughout and the cost really didn't end up being much higher than initially quoted despite the additional needs. I HIGHLY recommend Bob Brown!
1,Called to get an appointment for estimate and was told it would be $50 to get an estimate 😡😡😡 : I DECLINED
3,"Work was completed professionally, for the most part, however estimator grossly underestimated the amount of work/hours needed to complete the task (it ended up taking almost 2.5X as much time and costing nearly 2.5 times the estimate)"

And when I thought third time it will a charm, I was told that one of the guys with relevant skills will not be coming. I spoke to Ed conveying my displeasure. We started working with the guy that showed up. However, Ed called me back saying they found another guy with similar skill set and sent him...

5,The jobs went very well. There were 2 workers. They were prompt and requested input with each job.

The team arrived on time with all the necessary equipment and tools, prepped the area, mudded the seams, sanded, and then painted the areas. It looked as if there had been no repairs done. Blended perfectly with the entire garage. Great work."

5,"Arrived on time and went to work quickly. He did a good, professional job, which lasted just over the three hour Angie's List promotion and was consequently slightly more expensive than the special price. I had been advised during the estimate that the work would possibly take a bit longer, so this was not unexpected. This was a simple job and the rating applies only to this job. The quality of th...

5,"Went very well, work was not difficult just needed someone to climb about 25 feet up a ladder and that is something we don't like to do. The tech finished about and hour early. He was professional and cleaned up after himself. We supplied the materials and had them waiting so he did not have to take time to go to hardware store.

Then the first handyman couldn't make the appointment, so they sent me 2 guys for 2 hours instead. After an hour and a half, they were both done with the items that had been agreed to by the estimator, so they left. That means that I only got 3 hours of work instead of 4. Also, the caulking job was...

5,Excellent performance. Alberto and Javier are the absolute Best at what they do. Very pleased with the end result. Each area looks brand new
5,It went great. He was on time and he worked hard. I hired him through an Angies promotion for four hours labor. Our railings had always been a problem. They had always been slightly loose. He fixed the problem and they've been tight ever since. He actual worked slightly more than four hours. He wouldn't leave until the job was done perfectly. I was very impressed.
5,Did not know an estimator was coming for the first visit so arranged life to prep the work area and remove family etc They did the work promptly but should have identified the estimator as visit #1.
5,I'm very pleased with the work performed by Alberto and Kevin. They were knowledge and capable of performing the job at hand. I would most definitely consider JW Home Improvement for other home improvement projects.
5,Worker was on time and very professional. Cleaned up afterwards.
5,The caulking was done very neatly and continuously without gaps. Exactly what we were looking for.
5,"Very thermal estimate, very satisfied. Will definitely use them in the future"
4,"My issue with JW is the fact that you have to schedule an initial appointment for an estimate even if the job is exactly what is described in the service coupon purchased. Also, I had caulking done and it has already started coming up on one of the bathroom sink areas that was re-caulked."
5,"The worker they sent was exceptional, very pleased with his professionalism and expertise. It's been a year so I can't recall his name, alas. Definitely recommend!"
4,Reasonable job during 4 hours for $200 deal. Did not follow up with bid for completing work required. Their normal hourly rate is much higher so I did not want them doing this by the hour.
5,Went pretty well. They told me to buy a certain grout before the technician cMe but he said I needed another. The technician did a good job and the only problem was he missed a seam for caulking that I did afterwards.
5,"The bathroom work went without a hitch, but the window that had rot issues cracked while they were trying to repair it. They dealt with the problem with great professionalism, and paid for the replacement of a new one. The crew was very good, and very pleasant. We would hire them back in a heartbeat!"
5,Umberto did the work quickly and efficiently. He was flexible and helped me with moving items out of a room that I needed to get empty with short notice. He worked right up until the last minute and was easy to work with. I would diffidently use JW again and ask specify for Umberto.
5,"It went well. JW Home Improvement gets good marks for customer communication. I knew every step of the way what was happening and when. I was warned early on that one particular door might require extra work due to the awkward size of the frame. When that happened, they did the job well and explained clearly why they proceed as they did. I would hire them again."
4,Took a long time to schedule and get work completed - 2 stages to review and estimate and then to have work performed. The work was done well.
1,"Very unfortunate since I was happy with work JW did in 2014. I guess either they have become too 'big' to handle a small 2 day home job or perhaps it was just the individual estimator assigned to this neighborhood in Gaithersburg.

5,Overall everything we very well. I was especially pleased with all aspects of both Alberto and Kevin who performed the work.
5,"Excellent work! (Scheduled several weeks later than I had expected, however)."
5,"We had part of our balcony/upper deck painted by Alexey today. He was prompt, courteous, professional, and he did a great job today. We purchased the special of Angie's List for 3 hours at $149. Even the special was a little high compared to a day laborer from 7-11 for $10/HR; however, do you want someone like that in your home. Those workers could be anybody, have anything on their mind, and coul...

1,It didn't go since the estimator arrived 4 hours late and gave us a lousy estimate 4 days later. He wanted to charge a fee for the estimate which he waived after realizing he was playing with the wrong people!
5,"The worker did a great job. He was fast, neat and the results were what I'd hoped for."
4,"The handymen were great, they worked hard and did a great job completing all of the work I had lined up for them. The main issue was with scheduling, the first appointment I setup I had given them the list of work to be completed and only found out it was an assessment upon arrival. I took a half day off assuming he would be completing the work. For the actual appointment day, no one came in the m...

5,"They did a good job. They were prompt and professional, and brought all their own tools, ladders and equipment to complete the job."
5,"They called to set up the appointment, kept the scheduled time, and the person who arrived was very respectful and cordial. He got right to work and was very efficient. Each time I have used them, I have been very pleased."
5,"It took a bit of coordinating the approval of the work to be done. However, once JW Remodeling responded and reported for the task at hand, I was very pleased. It turned out I did not need the fan replaced and opted to get new light bulb covers installed on the fan. With the consultation of the service guy, he not only installed them, but cleaned the fan making it look brand new. He also went on t...

4,The job was completed and I was pleased.
5,Work was completed within 3-hour window despite attempted hard sell for twice the allotted time by individual providing initial estimate.
2,I declined the offer and requested Angie's List to refund my coupon purchase.
5,"Went well. On time, professional, finished within the 3 hour deal time. Best surprise was NO surprises. No attempt and up-sales or drawing out the work. Estimator was very accurate. Technician was quite personable."
5,Excellent job! Workers were reliable and professional. The two workers worked for two full days. We are very satisfied.
5,was on time. very pleasant and worked very hard.
1,"After speaking with them and garnering a quote, they were wanting me to pay for more than double the deal, more than I believe should be necessary. They would not give me an item list to purchase the materials, saying they required purchasing it themselves, but that was taken out of my labor time! I felt the whole experience was a scam and happily got my money back."
2,I just wanted the deck sanded and they kept insisting it needed to power washed it. They said if they sanded it then they would need to replace some boards. I just was not satisfied with the service and requested a refund for the deal I purchase.
1,"I did not hear from them so I contacted them. They said they needed to schedule an estimate first. The earliest they could get out was about 4 weeks. It was not a large shower stall but they said it would be a 4 to 6 hour job. I had this done a couple of years ago and another company only took an hour to do this. I had to provide my own materials. They told me I would need to give them my credit c...

5,quickly and outstanding workmanship.
5,Things went well. He worked very diligently.
1,"Angie's list was great! They refunded our payment and helped us find another contractor who did a great job, contacted us right away, and was much closer to the price on the offer."
3,"A representative came out and gave me a vebal quote. I did not like the fact I would pay $106.00 per hour for them to drive to Home Depot or another store from my house, buy materials and then drive to the house to start the job. I returned my purchase from Angie's list before the work was started."
3,Office staff inflexible on a block rate.
5,The replacement of the wood molding with composite molding went well the repainting also was perfect.
2,"After a misstep regarding an appointment for the JW rep to assess the job (my fault entirely), the JW rep arrived right on time for the second appointment. I started to explain the job. After I told him about needing to have the boards on top of the railing replaced, he said he thought that JW could just about get that done in 4 hours but that any work done beyond the 4 hours the charge would be o...

3,I felt like they added on extra charges to get back to the same amount before the deal. They were also several hours late.
5,The job that he did was so good I didn't even want to paint them. He did an excellent excellent job.
5,the work performed was above my expectation
5,It was a great experience to have such professional people work with us. The price was fair and the work perfect. Oscar was our carpenter and he is the most competent and efficient I have ever experienced. The job site was cleaned exceeding my expectations.
2,Company could not locate my house on day of scheduled repair . Called late with excuse . Asked for refund from Angie's List.
5,"A JW Improvement man rang us to arrange a time to look at the jobs that needed doing. He arrived on time, took photos of the jobs and gave us a quote of the time it would need with cost, we mentioned the Angies List coupon at this time. He took that into account. It was going to take two men 8 hours (worst case/longest time scenario) which was better than one man 2 days. We agreed. About one week ...

5,I am very pleased. The two workmen arrived on time. We walked through what needed to be done. I added a few tasks that had not been discussed prior to the appointment They were taken care of. I couldn't have asked for a better outcome on each of the assigned tasks. I would definitely use this service again.
5,"I hired JW to install a new front door and transom window. As always, JW was timely and professional and got the job done right. Justin Sellers and Chris Brown were a great team and I appreciated all of their assistance."
1,"The estimator and scheduler were fine. Day of work, the works that came did not speak nor understand much English, which made communication extremely difficult. I had to completely re-explain the job, which was supposed to be done by the estimator. The workers seemed to have no idea what needed to be done. One got to work while the other went shopping. The shopper took an hour to go 10 minutes dow...

JW came to our home, looked about five minutes on the trim repair on our front stoop, came in the house, introduced themselves and then said they wanted to walk around the house to see what else might need to be done. 90 minutes later they presented us with an estimate for four to six days work, 2 technicians at a time. I said whoa, all I want ri...

5,Awesome. The man was very professional and friendly as well.

5,Raymond was great. Got there on time. Gave us hints on upkeep. Good experience.
5,"Prompt, efficient, and professional."
5,Excellent job with good suggestions
5,Did an excellent job replacing drywall damage by water seepage
5,Very skillful technicians. Final price was substantially higher than the initial estimate.
4,Very easy to schedule and showed up on time. Purchased the four hour deal though Angie's List and an hour of the time was spent going to Home Depot to pick up some parts. The vanity is now leaking - the pipes don't align properly. I'm waiting to hear back from someone to fix the leak.
3,"The technician arrived at 9:15 am and then proceeded to unload his power washer, put on overalls and take the furniture off the deck. That took 45 minutes. At 10:00 am he said he needed to go to Home Depot to get more detergent, so was gone until 10:45. He immediately started work at 10:45 and stopped at 12:45 pm. He came to the door and said the four hours were almost up and it was going to take ...

4,"The technician was friendly & did a good job. He bagged the refuse neatly for me. I requested that because JW would have added a $150 removal fee to my bill. My major gripe are their prices. They billed me at $106 per hour. They do good work, but they're very expensive."
5,"The estimator was a few minutes late, but called ahead to let us know. He had an estimate ready for us in a few days. The service coordinator was very accommodating with scheduling the crew he thought was best for the job with our schedule. The technicians were a little early to the job and kept us informed as to what was going to need to be done. They had the job finished faster than expected and...

3,"Be prepared to pay them rates comparable to what you'd pay a lawyer, accountant, or hourly professional. They charge $106 per hour, for any worker. This includes $106 per hour standing in line at Home Depot to buy your materials. For comparison, other master carpenters in the DC area charge between $45-85. A few of the masters I've heard charge $100/hour... However, these guys typically hire cheap...

Then they would require several days to set a second appointment to schedule the actual work to be done. They said this was so they could make sure they had all tools needed. I expect a handyman to come prepared to do the simple tasks I was asking for...

5,Cesar from JW Home Improvement was assigned to the job and arrived right on time. He went over the details of the job with me and explained everything clearly. The job was originally estimated to take a 1.5 days but Cesar was able to complete the entire job in just one day. He did excellent work on the job.
4,"Work was excellent. Oscar was very knowledgeable, respectful and very good at his job. JW was more expensive than others, but the quality of their work made it worth it."
5,They did a good job and kept the area clean.
4,They broke a window but did fix it. The person that came out and assessed the project was really nice but the actual technician was extremely slow and took a lot of cigarette brakes. It was fine in the end.

Josh, the estimator, was prompt, helpful, and easy to work with. Raymond and Thomas were friendly, knowledgeable, and professional, and they did fine work. They didn't just re-attach the piece of siding but also secured nearby segments that had come loose. The w...

1,"I had purchased a general handyman purchase a few months earlier and when I called to follow up on the wood restoration, I was informed by JW Home Improvement that because I had purchased a completely different package I was not eligible to use this package. It took about 20 minutes for them to figure this out while I was on the phone. I was then told that I would need to call Angie's list to get ...

2,The estimator arrived on time. Initially the estimator was very friendly but later the estimator got angry and blew me off. Did not give me an estimate. Did not bother to tell me where his anger was coming from. Very rude young man.
1,Based on the verbal estimate the price was twice as high as other quotes we received.
5,"Very professionally done. The handyman arrived on time, was well prepared and did a quality job. He reinforced the drywall seams with extra screws, taped the seam, applied drywall ""mud,"" primed and painted the areas. Made sure that the paint blended well and cleaned up when he was completed."
1,Not well. They agreed to refund a site inspection fee when I canceled the appointment they agreed to refund their $75 site inspection fee. Never got that refund.

What I can tell you is that that Josh was the estimator who we spoke with about what we needed to be done. He was very responsive and knowledgeable.

5,They did a fantastic job. Glenn and Wilder (sp?) were great. The job went over the quoted price but that was partially because we agreed to some of the great ideas Glenn had to make the project better.

2,"HOW on earth has this company received all these positive reviews? My experience with them has been TERRIBLE. The estimator arrived and took pictures of the deck. He then sat himself down in my living room and alternately talked to me and into a recorder (as if to cover his backside) in terms of the estimate. I have a VERY small deck. 2 or 3 boards need to be replaced because the dogs have been cl...

Inexplicable charges for random materials appeared on the bill. The bill was sent several times with ""corrections"" and each time new errors crept in adding more to the cost. Materials were not itemized. By com...

5,I am extremely pleasd with Angel's work. He has perfected the ceiling and walls that other contractors could not do. I most definitely will hire him again. Thank You So Much Angel for an exceptional job!
5,"Jesse was on time and did a very thorough estimate as well as offering some great suggestions on the work. James helped coordinate the work through the customer service line and was very helpful with all of my questions. Justin did the work and he was excellent. He arrived early, worked steadily, finished quicker saving us money and did superb work on all of the projects. Great company and super p...

5,It went great. One employee got it all done it about 4hrs. The new caulk and grout looked perfect. It caulking was neatly done. And I really appreciated how the gentleman brought his own vacuum and cleaned up from his work. I'll definitely use JW again!
5,JW did a great job and we're very professional. I would definitely hire them again for future work.
5,"This is my second time using JW and I will call them for future projects. Raymond was punctual, incredibly friendly and very professional. He also thoroughly cleaned up after the project was complete."
5,"Great. Chris, the office project coordinator responded to our request promptly and scheduled the work to be done. Both Josh and Manuel came to the house to do the work. They arrived on time, were tidy and performed the jobs to our satisfaction. These were small jobs but at the very least we feel like we know who to call for handyman services, and perhaps more."
5,"The estimators were prompt and professional - and extremely helpful when I managed to drop and spill a full quart of paint all over myself and my laundry room floor (don't try to carry every thing in one trip)! Ceasar, the actual repairman, was very prompt, professional, prepared. I had an Angie's List deal for 6 hours and he managed to accomplish everything in that amount of time (included a coup...

4,"I only gave a B because their Angie's List deal is not worth it in the end. I would rather hire an independent handyman and avoid overhead and other unnecessary charges. Almost $1000 for the work done is not good value from experience I've had with other contractors. Ceasar was great, though. He arrived right on time, worked very hard and quickly, delivered a good quality of work and was very atte...

5,There was originally some confusion in contacting me but Sam called and straightened it out immediately. Josh and Telly came by and estimated the job and Janaka came the next day and did an excellent job removing the old caulk and putting in new.
4,"After writing via Angie's List, Sam called us and was able to schedule an estimate for the following day, which was great. The person giving us the estimate was very nice and professional, though he did initially quote the job as possibly needing 5 hours, which we pushed back on (it ended up only taking 2.5 hours, including an hour to go buy supplies, so I'm very glad we did not pay upfront for 5)...

5,"I contacted through Angie's List and got a call back almost immediately. Josh came out on time as scheduled (actually called and said he could come a little earlier - how often does that happen?) and walked through the job. As I suspected, the Angie's list 4 hour coupon wasn't sufficient to do the job but he gave me an estimate - good news - no wood rot visible. He called in and scheduled a crew w...

It was an extremely complicated process and the technician (Bob Brown) was able to realign the center bar to ensure proper rotation. I tried to do this myself, for about 2 hours and was unable to fix the pro...

Carpenters Fernando and Jesus showed up on time and worked quickly and neatly within the estimated time. A...

They got the work done and they did it well, but the estimate had been for one man and seven hours. It took two men seven hours. I called the next day and talked to someone in the office about the situation. In the end we agreed they would stand by the ori...

Oscar was the actual contractor who did the job. I re-showed him all that Josh & I discussed. Whatever materi...

They didn't tell us the rep who came out was only vaguely aware of what each task would require in manpower and time. His estimates turned out to be excessively high. (For example he estimated a whole day for 2 men [it was prescribed by the manufacturer as a ""2-man job""] to put together the two war...

5,Went very well. Good communication. Owner of company came by after to ensure our satisfaction. Very impressed with everything.
3,Everything was great except two things. One of the recessed lights stopped working soon after they installed it. JW sent someone out who said that it is covered by the warranty. They have not come to fix it. The second is that I had to rehang the tv because it was too close to the outlet and could not go against the wall.
5,Sam phoned within an hour to schedule an appointment for an estimate. He was polite and professional as well as persistent and accomodating with my challenging schedule. I'm a repeat customer and have always had good experiences with JW Home Improvement.
5,"Great! There were two men and they were quick, clean and professional. I felt it was a quality job."
5,JW Home Improvement did excellent work. Matt and his team completed the drywall repair and painting work as scheduled which proved to be more challenging than originally expected. The ceiling and wall looked new when the work was completed. We would definitely hire them again.
5,The JW Improvement rep did fantastic work. He was punctual and professional. He communicated well and did a great job on all the handy projects I gave him.
5,"Wonderfully well. First, a representative came to home to assess needs and provide estimated costs, including Angie's discount. Then, a handyman was dispatched who did all the necessary work in a timely and professional manner. We brought the fan and remote lights prior to his visit, and he purchased the dimmer switch. We were so pleased with JWHI that we are using company again to hang 50+ pictur...

5,"This was my third project with JWHI. Alexey has been on all three projects and is a remarkable worker. This last one turned into a huge project with need for attention to a lot of unexpected work and details of finish. Alex and William were right on time each day and cleaned up at the end of each day. They were also very careful and cognizant of my pets and took precautions to keep them out of the...

I decided to having hi...

The estimator was pushy and said the work would take 3-5 hours. I asked for the ceiling to be painted and the estimator said, we will do the ceiling and the trim. I didn't ask for the trim! The price for the two extra hours was ...

That took up most of the time. We are plann...

3,"The work was performed to my satisfaction. The employees seems to take their time and did not seem interested in the fact that the longer they took, the more it cost me. They took way to long to purchase materials. They had an estimator come out and prepare and estimate with quantities and then the actually handymen had to verify his measurements and inform me on changes. Why did they even waste m...

He arrived just a tad outside the window, but that's to be expected given the morning tr...

Then they informed me that I had to pay for the job up front.

We brought them back in 2016 to do some plumbing and light construction in our bathroom. There were some significant issues with that project that seem to have stemmed from one particular staffmember, who is apparently no longer with the ...

1,"They didn't find a leak in the roof even though the home inspector said there was one. They chalked the problem up to moisture build up from the bathroom exhaust fan venting to the attic and not outside, which I think was correct. Either way the home inspector didn't complain with that result. Fixed the bathroom door very quickly, just tightened some screws. Installed the vapor barrier but did not...

There are folks who might do the job for less--if you c...

The work performed was a little cheaper than just a single quote on one type of job, so also a great value...

5,The company called me the night before to confirm the time for the estimate. Sam arrived within the stated window and looked at each item to be done. He took pictures of the areas to be worked on and said that I would have an estimate within 24 hours. He was courteous and professional.
5,The work went very well. Wifredo and Thomas were excellent. Skilled and easy to work with. On time. On budget. Quality work. Back office support (Matt and Sam) was very good as well. We will hire JW again soon for a project involving our back porch.
5,"It was a job completed on time, professionally, and quickly. The project manager and the technicians explained what they were going to do and offered options. I wouldn't change a thing. We would definitely use them again."
5,Contractor showed up day before to tell me what supplies I would need to purchase. Laborer showed up next day and performed job exceedingly well. I was impressed with how clean he made my bathtub look. He also provided tips on how to maintain the tub's appearance.

4,"The Hispanic gentleman, Pedro, who did the work did a fantastic job. I don't think it could be done any better. Companies are very lucky to have such hard working people. In fact, his work is why I gave this company a B instead of a C. The deal was for grout/caulk, but once they came, grout was not part of the offer, just caulking, but I really wanted it done. I had to furnish the materials, and J...

The siding that needed to be replaced is a custom size and Cesar was able to find the right size which is not available at local stores. I appreciated that he took the initiative to locate store that carried it. Best of all they came in under estimate.

2,It was an attractive offer to induce the buyer to get an estimate to have an unreasonably high estimate for the work.
5,"The estimate for the major work was a bit out of my range, but I was extremely happy with the handyman service we received today. Two men split the 4 hours and both were courteous, very competent, professional, and hard working. I did not get the first guy's name, but the second guy was named Justin and they were both great. I would certainly do business with this company again."
5,JW Home Improvement is head and shoulders above other contractors.
5,"When they came to my house, they gave me a price, but they didn't explain it too clearly to me, and then they had the nerve to try and charge me for more than the quote. If you hire them to do work, make sure you get all the details before they start working. The workmanship was fabulous, wonderful and terrific. The people they sent out did a wonderful job, it was perfect. I was just upset with th...

We are very happy with the work performed and would use them again."
5,Rene was very meticulous and professional. Would definitely have him back. Sam did great scheduling and estimating. Pleased with the whole engagement.
5,"It turned out very well. There was additional charges because there was some other stuff that they did as we agreed on some other work for them to do. Workmanship was excellent. They are little costly. They were very responsive, very professional, timely. I would use them again and I have used them in the past as well."

They used wood with a plastic coating on the porch that will last longer & we won't ever need to paint. They patched holes on the side of the house with bondo so the woodpeckers can't open them back up again."
2,"They did send 2 people, who showed up on time. However, they didn't even get through half the list.

The area looked almost like a ""clean room"" with just the area he would be working on exposed. Even though we agreed the paint job on the ceiling holes would be ""touch-up quality"" and that the whole ceiling would eventually ne...

5,"Excellent! Fernando and Jesus worked on our interior work. They did an exceptional job, were kind and professional, and made our broken kitchen and bath look marvelous. Glenn was a trooper through the exterior work, which he completed solo in searing heat. He did an extraordinary job on our side door. We went from having heat floating in to have a door that keeps the elements out! Glenn also offer...

5,It went fine. They fixed the problem with my doors that had not been fixed correctly before
2,"We wouldn't do it again. I don't like their rudeness. We had quite a bit of problems with the home office. The guy who was sent out was fine once we came to an understanding with him but the front office was very rude when we called to say that there were problems. We had difficulty with them. The person who came out to do the work was fine. The office was not very cooperative. He pressured me for...

2,It wasn't great. The gentleman didn't do a very good job. He ran out of materials. He tried to patch things up in the end. He forgot about some of the things that he needed to do. It wasn't a very good experience overall. I was disappointed and I would not be using the company again. Their punctuality was okay.
5,Everything was great. This company was more expensive than other estimates but did a good job.
5,"The estimate process and time to actual job was pretty lengthy, but they did a great job!"
5,Sam took care of me and gave me the best options to get my project done. Charles worked hard to get the wood rot window repaired and it looking like new. I did a compare to other similar projects in the neighborhood and JW did the best job. Definitely no short cuts. They want their customers to be happy. I would recommend to anyone without hesitation. Thanks JW!!
5,It was really good. It was great. He was very helpful.
5,"It turned out well. They did the job unexpectedly. The Angie's List deal was helpful. We saved a lot of money. It turned out well. They finished the job within a couple of days. I have no complaints. It was good. They went above and beyond. He made sure he did the work right other than just doing it. He cleaned up after he left. Whatever they did is holding well. I didn't have to call them again. ...

4,"Everything was excellent up until billing. The estimate was professional and clear, the workers did a good job and were professional and punctual. The work has held up well, at least for the initial few months to date. But, we paid an advance and used an Angie's List deal, both of them cashed in up front. After the work was done, we were never able to get them to send an invoice. This included sev...

5,"Kenny, Fredy and Ricardo came out to do the work, and they did a great job. The were efficient and friendly. They fixed the siding, the trim, the roof, all the caulking, and they even trimmed the tree."
5,"I cannot thank enough for the service I got. JW's customer service is beyond par and one of the best. I really loved it when they resolved all my issues and concerns, I will definitely recommend them to anyone. A+ Five stars and whole nine yards!!"
5,"The guys were great. Freddy and Ricardo were 100% professional and did an outstanding job. They (as well as the folks at the home office) kept me informed at every step of the process. I never found myself wondering how things were going. I felt they were a little pricey, but for the quality and the customer service, I would definitely hire again."
5,"It went great! We had a deal of four hours for $199. He went over by about an hour but we got so much done we felt it was worth it. The only problems we had were not with Justin, but with scheduling. We the phone folks are nice but could be more organized. I got bounced around a bit. The original day we scheduled for an estimate had to be postponed on their end and was rescheduled a week later. Th...

5,Well. I never remember any problems when using vendors recommended by Angie's list.
5,The technician was an excellent carpenter who handcrafted a piece of cedar wood and fixed the damaged area.
5,Very well. The technician was very efficient and respectful. Was able to complete all our items on our punch-list.
5,"Great! Justin was very thorough and professional, removing all the old moldy caulk (several layers in some places) and replacing it, leaving the shower area as though it had just been installed. Though his work was painstaking, he actually finished is less time than the estimator had quoted me. I'd use JW again and ask for Justin!"
5,"Pedro was wonderful! He arrived on time and did a very thorough professional work. He cleaned up very well after the job. The paint job on the repaired area looks great. I've waited to write my review until we've had a heavy rain. The repairs kept the rain out. My only suggestion... remind the homeowner that they will need trim paint for the job. I had it, but had to search while Pedro waited."
5,"The repairman arrived on time. He explained what he intended to do and how long (maximum) he thought it would take. The repair took a bit less time than predicted. He did as much as he could to keep the inside door closed to prevent debris coming into my house. He cleaned up very well. The repair fixed the problem and looks very good. This is the second time I've used JW for rotting wood around my...

He seemed more concerned with getting in and out within the 3 hours then to get as much work on my list done. The work was poorly done. I called back JW to have someone come back out to redo the work. We scheduled an app...

5,"Great estimate provided by Josh and very satisfied with the technicians final product as well. Took 2 men, 3 hours, so was billed for 6 total hours of work. Used an Angie's List deal for 3 hours ($199), then paid for the additional 3 hours separately. Have already planned to schedule another set of odd jobs to be done with JW."
5,"GREAT The response, estimate, work and followup were all top notch. Josh was our contact and estimator, he was knowledgeable and very responsive. Oscar was our tech and he was excellent in skill, and professionalism. The whole process was smooth, everybody I ever spoke with was professional, upbeat, and knew their job!"
2,"Declined services, due to price unfairness. They charge for estimates and then they only do T&M-LH (labor hour) contracts. If a companies accepts ONLY hourly work and not fixed price work, this suggest they are not competent enough to evaluate how long the job will take to then give 1 price. Why would anyone accept work from someone who cant properly evaluate how long the job will take after revie...

1,"Work so far appears to be ok, but final cost was double that of estimate. Not all of the work requested in the original estimate was completed."
4,They did a good job and were kind of slow. They made go through a lot of options and they didn't work on the weekend. They were good to work with. It took longer to get the job done than I expected.
1,"It was a train wreck. I scheduled for an appointment on a Wednesday morning - the company called Tuesday afternoon and said that they had accidentally scheduled the appointment on the guy's day off and asked if they could reschedule for first thing in the morning - 8:00am the following Monday. I adjusted my work schedule to accomodate, but by 10:00 on Monday no one had showed up. I called the offi...

However, it took much longer than the estimator had expected and so JW billed us an additional $250 above the $400 deal we purchased on Angie's list. JW really did spend that much time helping us, so their bill isn't fraudulent. And our bathroom faucet had unusual issues that made it take longer without JW necessa...

He did not move the latch plates but instead tighten the screw on the doors so yes it worked fine for a day and not is almost impossible to lock ...

5,It went well. They did a thourough job and my deck looks great!!
4,They did a fine job but I was forced to pay an extra $50 just to schedule which seemed a bit ridiculous. They also did a quote which would have added on many more hours.
1,"It didn't go well at all. I purchased a Big Deal certificate from Angie's List to get three hours of handyman service for $149.00. I scheduled and appointment with JW Home Improvement twice to get the work done and they were a ""no-show"" both times. I'm still trying to get a refund of my money because the work was not done. I give JW Home Improvement a big fat ""F""; they are not reliable."
1,Not well at all. I bought a Big Deal for three hours of h andyman service for $149.00 with JW Home Improvement. Scheduled and appointment twice and JWHI did not show up both times. They are very unreliable. I will never use them again.
2,"Have used these folks twice in the past. The people actually doing the work have great skills. The problem I have is management's sales tactics. They always send out a sales person, typically young with very limited knowledge, whose role in my opinion is to overestimate the job. For the above work, I received an estimate of approx. $5,000. After I got mad, they indicated we could still work someth...

They were pleasant to work with, took pride in their work, and finished the work in a remarkably short period of time. They also made suggestions for other caulking needs and promptly made the repairs with my encouragement. I am glad that I hired their company. Job well done."
3,"I have a bit of an issue with them. The sent an estimate over and they put me on the schedule and then when they were supposed to arrive, they didn't show up. So I had to call and they told me the estimator had been fired. And they worked on it and they sent someone fine. It was just not pleasant to take the day off to wait for somebody to show up. I wasn't happy with how they got started. They di...

4,"JW sent two technicians that did the carpentry work. They came out on two separate occasions. Showed up when they said they would, worked efficiently and cleaned up after themselves. It looks good!."

They pointed out additional deterioration, eg on the trim, and replaced the piece before painting. The team was very conscientious re solid fixes that won't require redoing. The work was completed within the labor estimate, although it stretched...

5,"Estimate and job went quickly and smoothly. Larry is great with the carpentry, also had good advice and genuinely cared about our needs (e.g. suggested NOT to stain the wood because it would be smelly in a garage and not good for the kid, also you couldn't step on it for a few days while it dried)."
1,Not very well. It is a rental unit and I was not there. They provided an estimate that was very high. I called the office to understand the estimate and the manager did not know how the estimate was put together.
4,"That was fine, it was fine. They were fine they were good. I literally had probably an hour and forty five minutes worth of work for them and they offered to do whatever else and I said no, I think they did everything they needed to do and that was fine. They were just an handymen they were not an expert on anything but they were if you had someone has an handymen to call I guess it would be what ...

We had JW come out after we bought our house to fix a roof leak that had ruined the drywall in one of our guest rooms. 8 months later, we noticed that the leak had reappeared and the drywall once again had water stains and chipping in the exact same place. Since the work was under a year warranty, we called them...

5,Great! Everything was completed to my satisfaction and on time. I would definitely recommend JW Home Improvement to all. Oh and by the way there was no air conditioning in my house on that particular day but it was cool outside so there was only slight breezes entering the windows.
5,The work done by JW Home Improvement was first rate. I especially appreciated the diligence to ensure we used a plastic sleeve over cast iron before placing a new wax ring (aka the reason we had an issue was the installer had not properly accounted for the age of the house).
5,"Excellent! David was very meticulous and thorough. He arrived 15 minutes earlier than scheduled, got a clear understanding of the project, recommended the paint brand that we should purchase and proceeded to sand the surface while we made a quick run to the store to purchase the paint. We are very pleased with the outcome."
5,"Freddy G and Ricardo V came out to do the work, and they did a great job. The were efficient and friendly. They got the job done quickly and cleaned up after themselves. They were very respectful and explained what they were doing."
5,"Our initial experiences with JW Home Improvement have been outstanding! We are already following up with them to schedule our next small home improvement jobs. First the front office: The management folks are polite, knowledgeable, and responsive. It is easy to get answers, and they work hard to accommodate your schedule and make sure that your needs are met. One person in particular (Chris) who h...

5,Old broken bifold doors were replaced with bypass closet doors. The job was done well and ahead of the estimated time to complete. Didn't know how improved the room could look with new closet doors.

5,"I bought an Angie's List coupon for four hours of work. Pedro showed up on time, set up efficiently, and got to work in a hurry. The job took one hour more than the coupon, but the work was very well done."
5,Fabulous. Carpenter came on time and performed work as expected.
4,Very well. The handyman was very good.
4,"The work was fine but I purchased four hours of the handy man service, they ended up sending me two guys for two hours. So they came and they got everything done in a hour and a half.

5,"Very well. Ray was a very nice, charming, friendly gentleman who explained everything that was going to be done, why it was being done, and what could be done in the allotted time. He was great and I would absolutely recommend him and request him for future work."
5,"Went well. Ray was right on time, very professional and friendly. He talked me through what he was doing so I knew exactly what was happening."
5,"It went well. I did not appreciate that I had to schedule an appointment for an estimate and after that there was a 4 week wait for the appointment for the actual services. Thankfully my work was not urgent! That said, I am pleased with the work they did--they arrived on time and were very courteous. I would use them again if I found myself in a situation where the wait time did not matter."

By the time I realized it, it was too late for him to regrout since the shower had to stay dry after he caulked. I had bought a 4 hour package, so I had to come up with other little things for him to do and I ended up wasting my 4 hours on nonsense."

He also sealed the backsplash along the entire length of the kitchen cabinets and the work looks amazing. He finished within the prescribed time and did a great job cleaning up!!!"
5,I was called two days after the estimate paperwork was confirmed and a date was set and time was set. Cesare arrived well within the agreed upon time. He wore foot protection as he moved around the house to the deck. He went quickly to work and finished the job as agreed upon. The deck looks great!!!!!

We had purchased a deal through Angie's List for 4 hours of wood repair, and then discussed a bigger job when the estimator came out.

3,"The work was great. The gentleman who did the work was professional and did a great job. Dealing with JW, however, was not great. Scheduling was a pain, their billing was all wrong, I had to make a bunch of phone calls to get these basic issues resolved. To be clear, the low marks in my review entirely have to do with dealing with JW - not the guy who came to do the work."
4,"Repair work on door was excellent--in fact, several other handy guys had tried to fix it & failed. Other work was fine, except repairman broke something & had to go to hardware store to get supplies, & I was originally billed for his time & supplies, although later some of this cost was removed. In hindsight, I should have made a note on the time sheet."
5,"Pedro was the employee they sent for JW Home Improvement. He was professional, polite and a very nice guy form the start to the finish. The painting only took 45 minutes but the other 3 hours of time was for the primer to dry. So all things considered I went over by 30 minutes on this 4 hour deal."
5,The wood rot was repaired and the leak was addressed with caulking and the addition of some pvc. The job required an additional two hours which seemed very reasonable. The trim around the door was also painted. The estimate and work was provided professionally and all involved were friendly and informative. Job well done for a reasonable price.
5,"Great, as always. Thomas did a fantastic job."
5,"Thomas arrived right on time and got quickly to work. Job was more difficult than initially thought, but no issues getting it done. I would highly recommend JW Home Improvement, as well as Thomas. Pleasant guy who did a great job in my house with two dogs and two cats, all interested in what he was doing."
1,"After giving the person a description of exactly what I wanted an estimate on he sent back an estimate that reflected none of the work I wanted done in the manner I had prescribed.

And to add insult t...

4,"It went okay. The big deal covered the cost. We did have an issue with the guy they sent out. He asked for our credit card. He wanted a credit card and I told him that we had already paid for it and he didn't need any credit card. He said, ""Oh well this is just in case we have to go to Home Depot and buy some more."" I said, ""You're not going to go to Home Depot and spend the whole amount of time l...

5,"Raymond came over to do the work. He was professional, friendly and courteous. Most importantly, he did an excellent job and worked quickly. I will use JWHI again and highly recommend them."
5,"Excellent! Sam and Brian were my initial contacts and were professional and helpful. Manuel H. did the repairs, was excellent, and one of the best who I have worked with. I highly recommend all of these people and this company. They do high quality work in a timely and professional manner. They are slightly more expensive than other contractors, but it is worth it given their service quality and p...

5,"Great. A week before someone came out to the place to assess and view the work needed to be done. He was kind and very professional. I was informed of what to expect. Then the fallowing week someone came to do the work. He came early, listen to my concern, thought through the problem at hand quickly sizing up the situation and headed to the nearby Home Depot to purchase needed items. He was except...

5,"It went very well! In addition to attending to all my requested needs, Willfredo Alvarez (the man who did the work) performed a few ""extra's"" as well! He noticed that one sink area badly needed some caulking, so he took care of that in addition to doing an excellent job on the bathtub and surrounding tiles. He also fixed some bathroom lights that I had been unable to replace (due to the wrong size...

4,"The painting was OK. I think that it took an inordinately long time, so the cost per hour was a bit much, in my book. I think that because I paid for a certain amount of time they wanted to use that amount regardless of what was done."
5,great job arrived on time hard worker
5,Power wash was done by James and Sung. They were very nice and did a great job.
5,"As always, great work done and quickly. I have never had a problem with J&W, using them for years."
5,"JW sent Alberto and Kevin to do this job. They arrived on time and well prepared for the work. The assembly job was somewhat complicated, with a large number of steps to be completed carefully and in precise order. They looked over the instructions and went immediately to work. In less than two hours they had put everything together in exactly the correct way. Although this job was somewhat out of...

3,"I was not very happy with the services. They did a really poor job and frankly overcharged me. So I won't be using them again. They power washed it. They were supposed to sand it, but they didn't. Then they sealed it. I paid almost $1000. They had to come out three times. The first time they came out and the guy gave me an estimate and told me it was going to be $600 or $700 more than what I paid ...

4,JW did come back and made the situation right. They were very apologetic and didn't charge me for the toilet service.
5,"The day started off shaky do to the original working calling out sick and then some technical issues with their scheduling software. But the scheduler saved the day and was eventually able to get a well trained, professional and courteous replacement handy man by the name of Raymond to come out to complete the job. Raymond did excellent work and explained himself every step of the way, even offeri...

5,"Excellent. Manuel was on time and got to work right away. After he replaced the ceiling fan, bathroom faucet, and window blinds, there was some time left over so he replaced the outside door light fixture, too. Very pleased with the work performed."
5,Rocky and Ever arrived on time and completed the job in a timely manner. They were very professional and courteous. The repairs were quite satisfactory. I would highly recommend this contractor for general home repair and maintenance work.
5,Job was done very well. Chris was great. Very professional. He determined what was needed to be done and went right to it. He didn't leave a mess behind and he stayed within the timeframe. I definitely plan on using this company for other projects.
5,"The 2 individuals work efficiently and followed my instructions, neatly stacking the bricks beside an outdoor deck."
5,"James and Sung were great. They arrive on time and get right to work. They are very thorough, pleasant and do their best to ensure high customer satisfaction. Communication was excellent, they kept me advised at all stages of the work. They were cooperative with other workers we had on site. Overall very good, highly recommended. I'd hire them again."
5,Cesar arrived at 7 AM and was done before noon. He was polite and the work was thorough. Will use them again for other work.
1,"This was an absolute nightmare. When the two gentlemen arrived to do the work, there did not have the windows (even after telling me they were in the van); they left for 2 hours to ""pick up materials"" and when they came back, they said they could not find the windows. When they tried to install the new screen door, they drilled a hole in the door on the wrong side (for the handle) and then were no...

He knows what he is doing and it does not matter what it is, he knows how to make it right. I am so happy to have these projects done that I have postponed for years. JW checked in with me to make sure all was going well, and kept me informed by e-mail ...

5,"The contractor showed up early and once I showed him the work to be done, began the repairs. I provided most supplies and he purchased the rest from Lowes. He was able to repair all of the damaged windows in the block of time allotted by the Angie's List Big Deal. I was happy with the work done and would use them again."
2,They wanted to charge $3000 above the Angiesl list coupon. Another contractor did the work for $480.
5,"The service people were courteous and professional, the deck is beautiful."
5,"I was truly blown away at the superior level of service! James and Sung arrived exactly on time and immediately got to work. Their level of craftsmanship and attention to detail was far above average. In addition, they were both a pleasure to deal with -- polite, tidy, and just genuinely nice gentlemen. When they had finished, I was astounded at the difference their hard work had made on my decks....

There was significant damage to repair and the doors came back looking like new. There is no difference between the original painted wood and the repaired parts and this should last a good while. Glen was interested in doing a spectacular job and that is what I...

5,"I've had a problem with water damage in one area of the ceiling. I had two roofers look at the roof and they said they couldn't see a problem, but it's an older roof, so I should probably get a new roof or coat the whole thing with something used on flat roofs. I couldn't see getting a new roof when there's was apparently a leak in only one small area, so I had JW look at it, thinking they could s...

5,"A JW estimator, Pedro, came out in mid-July to give us an estimate for the two projects. He was a good man to talk with as he answered questions we had at that time. He gave us a good estimate as to the amount of time the work would take and the cost involved. We set up an appointment for their earliest opening, Aug. 15. The company called us on Aug. 4 and said they had an opening for projects on ...

5,"Everything went very well. The gentleman, Janaka, was polite and efficient. The estimate on how much time it would take was very generous and the work was done in almost half the time. Luckily I had some extra things to do to fill the leftover time."
5,"JW's company did the job right; they did it efficiently, and we'll probably hire them for future jobs. Sung and James were extremely professional and communicative. I was so shocked by how nice the deck looked after it had been power-washed and sanded that I emailed the company directly about James's great work. On the second day, they arrived early (a good thing in my book) which allowed me to ge...

5,Terrific. Our bathrooms looked TONS better when it was finished.
5,"Thomas Matamoros did a great job. The existing caulking was over 15 years old. The finished caulking was seamless and neat, and the bathroom looks like brand new. Thomas completed the job in just over 3 hours. The work area was fully cleaned up."
5,Everything went well. The mirrors were heavy and had to be hung on plaster walls.
5,"We had two different jobs scheduled with JW Handyman, one for 6 hours and one for 3 hours: 1) Oscar arrived right on time and did a fantastic job installing a wood floor in our attic to make it usable storage space. He finished with 30 mins to spare. We were so pleased with his work (and how easy he was to work with) that we ended up extending for an additional hour to install a baby gate (which w...

3,"I used an Angie's list deal for this. I believe it was 3 hours for $150 dollars. I had a great experience with the handyman, but not an outstanding experience with the estimator's role and the home office. My concerns about the estimator and the home office were not personal. They seemed like nice people, but there was just some confusion over my Angie's List purchase and a ""car dealership"" feel t...

When I finally spoke to them and requested a date for service, they informed me that I needed to ha...

5,Manuel Hidalgo was the best workman I've ever had.
5,The two workers were punctual courteous and conscientious about the quality of their work. Outstanding!!.
1,"Technician was a no show. No phone call either. After the 2 hour appointment window passed, I called them but got voicemail...they were closed. Absolutely no respect for their customer's time."
4,"the door, which was the primary job, got completed in the 3 hour time frame purchased."
1,"Buyer Beware: They charge $50 just to have an estimator come to your home and give you an estimate for the job - which they say will be deducted from the bill if you place an order with them. I did place an order initially but the quote to repair a small section of wooden fencing around my townhouse was $1600. I looked elsewhere and found a local carpenter that did the work for $300. Looks great, ...

After selecting the Bondo method, he got to work right away. Three hours later, you could not tell that there had ever been a bad patch on the door jamb. The repair was seamless. He even took a few minutes to ...

5,"Sung, the handy man, arrived early. He was so nice, knowledgeable and hard working. He completed the work ahead of the estimated schedule and cost. He even cleaned the dirt/mold off of my side walk. He thoroughly cleaned and replaced the wood on my deck. Excellent job. I also had taken advantage of the Angie's List deal of $199 for 4 hours of labor, which was a great deal."
5,"Sung, the handyman, arrived early and was so pleasant, knowledgeable and hard working. He finished ahead of estimated schedule and cost. He thoroughly cleaned and repaired my old deck and even got some of the dirt/mold off of my house and sidewalks. Excellent job. I also had taken advantage of the $199 for 4 hours of labor from Angie's List which was wonderful."
5,"I bought an Angie's List offer for up to three hours of work. The workman, Chris, did a terrific job that required less than three hours. He cleaned the area as he was working and left it spotless. We're very pleased with the result."
5,"THEY WERE FANTASTIC! Great service, personnel, etc. The completed all the work requested. I would definitely recommend them, especially for this $199 special offered by Angie's List, but also for work outside the list. They were great!"
5,"Both the estimate and work visits went well. Thomas did a great job in the Master bath shower and the tub/shower combo on the second floor. Thomas was on time, and worked steadily for 3 hours to remove the old caulk and apply the new caulk. He was professional and cleaned up after himself. I appreciate his hard work and a job well done."
5,"Sung did an excellent job and exceeded our expectation on the deck powerwash. We bought the $199 angies list deal for washing and deck repair. Beware of these deals though, the actual quote to do the job will likely be much higher and you'll have already spent the money and need to go with the company. We live in old town and have a very small house and decks, the estimate we received just covered...

5,"The team arrived exactly on time, as scheduled; Manuel reviewed all work on the estimate clearly and explained what he would do, and in what sequence. Manuel and Hector worked quickly and efficiently and accomplished all work in accordance with the schedule. Manuel and Hector did a very professional job; I'd highly recommend them and JW Home Improvement."
5,"I have used JW before and every time I do I have never been disappointed, Justin is the worker who was sent to do the job. He was courteous, prompt, tidy and most of all efficient. The only thing that was different was it took a longer amount of time for service because they were so busy. My thought is when you are good your busy."

Without a deal they are not work, that's what I am saying. They did not do a very good job on the trim repair on the deck door and they did not do a good job on the toilet paper holder -- they had to come ...

5,"We were very impressed with Thomas who did the work for us. He did a great job with the shower and had extra time. I purchased a 3 hour service, so instead of saying well I did what I needed to do he asked what else he could do and he hung a cabinet and mirror in bathroom. Very impressed with his work ethic, it made the move- in so much easier for us."
5,I am very happy with the way the room turned out. Manuel and Wilfredo were very professional and communicated well with me. The work started and finished on time. Price seems reasonable. I was a little frustrated that the decisions I made when the estimator was assessing the job did not get conveyed to the people doing the work.
4,"The repairmen came on time and did not completely fix the window. There was a large chip left in the frame of the window. I contacted JW Home Improvement, and they came out and finished the repair fairly quickly. Although I would have liked the project to have been done correctly the first time, they did a fairly good job in remedying the repair after I saw the chip. The main problem that I had wi...

4,"I purchased a big deal for deck restoration, and asked them about also power washing the deck. They gave me an estimate and told me it would probably take a couple of extra hours. I was ok with that and they gave me the estimate for all of work. The quality of the work they did was fine as far as I can tell. I think they delivered on that. The person who came and gave me the estimate was not the p...

I would not prepay again for any work fr...

1,"First, the estimator did not bring a ladder so he did not see the roof. Second, he estimated 8-12 man-hours, far more than other estimates. I asked for my $50 fee to be refunded, but they did not do so. I view this as a fraud. How can you estimate a roof repair if you don't bring a ladder to be able to see the roof? I will never use these guys."

I've just got to make sure that they charge me the right amount and credit me for the hours. The work they did was fine. The cost just kind of seemed like was more than it really needed to be.
2,"Frankly I was reluctant to pay $50 for getting an estimate for exterior paint job, but after seeing so many reviews I decided to give these guys a try.

The guy who showed up said that they don't do fixed price and they will charge by hour. After...

5,Ignatius worked so efficiently that the work we had contracted to was completed within our 3-hour big deal and he was able to secure the decking that was loose.
5,Ignatius was very neat when painting the deck. He arrived on time and was friendly. He worked fast!

Alex from JW came right on time and within an hour had fixed the whole mess.

The young man was early for the appointment, which was fine but he was here only about 10 minutes. He was dressed nicely ...

3,"I had used JW previously and was pleased with their work. This time, I had to pay $50 for them to come estimate the work. Then, their estimate was almost twice anyone else's (who gave a free estimate by the way). Did not have JW do the work because they are too expensive. Don't call them unless you are 100% sure that they are they company you are going to use because you have to pay them just to g...

5,Chris Brown did exceptional work in a most efficient manner. The service was excellent. Plan to use JW Home Improvement again. Thank-you.
4,"The workers were good. In the end there were still some air gaps and so forth in the area that they worked on. They did the sort of basic thing that was requested but in the end there was still some air getting in through the area they were working on. Once they were under there, they should have seen to other things and done something about them."
2,"Service Provider didn't really do an inspection, no professional opinion when I asked for what needed to be done. They just told me the work would require additional hours outside of the 3 hour deal for $149. This additional work would result in additional fees. I called ahead of buying this deal and they confirmed it could be completed within the 3 hour time frame."
5,Handyman showed up promptly and finished work in under three hours. He was courteous and did not make a mess.
5,It went very well. The roofers explained everything that was wrong and everything that they were going to do to fix it. They were able to get it done under the time that was expected thereby saving me dollars. Very professional and understanding of the problem. Punctual and didn't stop until the job was done and double checked their work to ensure there were no more leaks.
5,"Everything went great from the scheduled estimate/quote to the day of service. They are arrived early or exactly on time, completed the job and more. JW made sure that I was satisfied with the service before they left, which is a huge deal."
2,They were trying to overcharge me. I had to purchase all the materials and he told me it would cost $1700 and I would have to pay extra for every time they went to the store.
5,"Chris was the gentleman who came to house. He was good polite & helpful! He fixed everything perfectly, & was so I'm pressed; please recognize him for his work!"
4,"My experience with them went fairly well. They did a real good job, but they ended up having to come back several times. Part of that was because of the weather. There was a little bit of confusion about the work. But overall, their professionalism was quite good."
5,"Great, communication from the beginner was excellent; the estimate was reasonable & accurate. The estimate & service person were professional on time. The work in the service person was excellent & he went on time & beyond."
5,"JW sends out an estimator initially to determine whether the work requested can be performed in the time allotted. Initially I thought that was annoying, but it really does prevent any surprises the day of service. The estimator was prompt and provided a list of items for me to purchase prior to the service call. As it turned out, the handyman didn't end up using some of those items, so I should b...

4,"The JW person arrived late (the original person could not make it, so JW sent someone else-Ignatius). Ignatius did a great job, staying until all the work was done."
5,"Ignatius was on time and very polite. He did an excellent job power washing our deck, and he also cleaned our wooden rocker, which was a welcomed surprise to us. He made sure to clean the house walls and other areas, so that it all looker great!"
5,"I purchased a Big Deal for 4 hrs of deck repair. Sung did a great job getting our deck and siding looking great again. He showed attention to detail, and even noticed areas in need of attention that we'd missed! Bryan gave the estimate for the job, and was spot-on with the time needed. I'd be happy to use JW again."
5,"Josh came out to do an estimate in May. He was polite, punctual, and explained that what we had on our list would exceed the 3-hour deal we had purchased. So, we decided to delay the recaulking of a shower, and just have the other misc. items on our punch list taken care of. He gave us the list of materials we would need and contacted his office to schedule the actual work. Janaka is the handyman ...

After cutting a rectangular opening into the ceiling they could see that the leak was not from the pipes but was coming from a place in the shower. In order to resolve the problem, the workers wanted to replace the entire shower floor with new tile and grout.

1,"No show / last minute rescheduling for a deck improvement estimate twice in past month, after I bought their $199 coupon."
5,it went very well. Oscar was the handyman. He was courteous and very helpful. Tidied up after he worked. Wore booties I n the house.
5,Workman arrived on time; very polite. In heavy rain he diligently performed work.
5,"Kenny was on time and after quick overview went sight to work. Despite some alignment problems with the door knocker, he persevered and screwed it into the door. No job seemed beyond his talents. When he needed extra materials, he obtained these from how depot in a reasonable time."
5,"Very, very good. This is the second time I have hired them. The wosrkmen came early, were professionally attired and tidy. The work was done efficiently. I had to reschedule the job a couple of times because of rain but they did it without a hitch. I called around to many dedicated door installers before JW. Most of them were not interested because it is a door they did not install and were uncert...

5,The service provider Raymond was extremely personable and friendly. And his work was perfect. I would highly recommend these guys and especially Raymond.
5,"It went very well. The handyman, Oscar was very friendly and informative. He made me feel comfortable with what he was doing. He explained to me what he was doing and why it needed to be done that way to prevent future repairs."
5,"This company, JW Home Improvement, was excellent in every way. They were timely with their visit to estimate the job, they scheduled the work quickly and at a time that was convenient for us, and they were flexible when the job changed and we needed support outside the scheduled work window. Because we needed to bring in a glass company to do the work on a new frameless shower enclosure in the mas...

5,"I would like to commend Oscar of JW Home Improvement for the fine job he did on repairing a tricky area of ceiling in my sunroom. He worked steadily throughout and wasted no time; when compound needed to dry on the ceiling, he addressed the outdoor shutters and was able to securely fasten them back on the exterior. He cleaned up the work area when finished -- overall, a great job, Oscar!"
5,"Alberto and Kenny did an excellent job overall. I was very impressed with Alberto's knowledge and professionalism. On arriving, he felt that the time estimate was inadequate and contacted his supervisor. The supervisor called me to discuss and we came to agreement that would involve me paying at the new time estimate but protected me in case the time ran beyond that, which I found fair. The work p...

5,"They did a great job. There were some issues fitting my unique, crooked bookshelves in the same space with the new floor. He used a special tool and took a creative approach to solve the problem."

5,"Chris was fantastic from start to finish! I was very impressed with his politeness, professionalism, and knowledge of how to correct the problems! He was outstanding! A + + + He was respectful of me working from home but answered any questions I had when needed. Excellent service!"
3,"This was a big deal purchase. I really did not like them because I think they took much longer than they should have taken and then they charged me more, but then they knocked down the price. I was not happy. They got such great reviews but I was not happy with them. They told me I also needed work on the outside of the house including some painting and stuff. They gave me an estimate of like 6 or...

4,It was fine. They tried to charge me a quarter hour of labor more but I told them it wasn't right. They could have been clearer with communicating. The technician needed to borrow my own garden hose. They could have the proper equipment. They were good.
5,"The estimator was friendly and very thorough in his descriptions of the work to be done. He was running a little late because another appointment ran late. He called to let me know this, which I appreciated."
1,"Because of poor customer service and scheduling by the front office since the initial in-home assessment of the job, I have decided not to have them perform the repair. During the in-home assessment, the contractor confirmed that the job could be done in the four hours I contracted for and that it could be done within a week to ten days after the in-home assessment. Their failure to provide even t...

I pre-paid online for the six hours of service for $402.00 and had a long tick list. When the estimator came he indicated that it would take much longer than the six hours to complete my list, so I dropped the touch-up painting and painting two bathroo...

5,"Oscar was the tech. He is a perfectionist and did a perfect job. For example, after he swapped out the ceiling fan, he painted the ceiling that was exposed by the narrower new fixture. That was a bonus since I am not good at painting and I hate to paint. He used some paint that I already had on hand. He was very knowledgeable, polite, and worked very fast, I couldn't be more pleased with the outco...

They were prompt in returning any phone calls or communication with quotes and explanations of services. The day of the repairs, the repairman was very prompt, efficient, and professional. He did excellent work and the price was great. We will definitely be using them again!"
3,"It was not as timely as I would have liked. I didn't believe an estimate was necessary. The person came out did a slow and diligent job. The supervisor came out twice and they charged me for two extra hours without letting me know in advance that they were going over the four-hour limit and charging me for it. The price was good for the four hours but they charged me an additional $212 for the tim...

5,Fantastic! Have used them three times with great results.

Everyone is very professional, knowledgeable and nice. The company should be pleased with their employees. Our tech was especially great!"

4,"This was a $199 big deal purchase for four hours of handyman service. It cost a whole lot more than the big deal. it did not take that long for them to get there. I thought maybe they would go over the four hours so I was prepared for, maybe, another extra two or three hours. I mean, they did the work, but they just took their time about it. There were some issues that I did not know so I asked th...

2,"Their agent was prompt and thorough, but the price he gave me was WAY out of line- and he said the cost of materials would be added to the estimate. I easily found other contractors willing to do the job for less than half the quoted price. I requested and received a refund from Angie's List for the ""deal""."
3,It was okay. I was underwhelmed. There was a little bit of confusion about what the services entailed. We ended up working it out. We clarified the confusion. It was fine. There was a communication issue. We thought they were going to be able to get a lot more done with the timeframe. It was resolved.
4,"One really has to watch the fine print with this company and monitor their time on the job. I was interested in this company because I was going to be hiring for a number of small handy man jobs and their capability statement was exceptional and I thought I could use them for a variety of small jobs in the near future. They had a good reference from Sotheby's and the company was responsive in the ...

We are talking three front steps and a deck that is approximately six feet by eight feet. I explained that I have had all three of ...

2,"It didn't go well. Somebody at Angie's List helped us switch to a different company. I told him that these were things that I needed to have done right away. The guy ignored me and said that if they needed to get parts it was going to cost more. He said the labor rate was $405 an hour. I thought that was a little steep for labor.

They were polite, etc. We had the work done by the 2nd painter who arrived with a helper...

5,"Great job. For the third window he cobbled parts from the other two to make the fix. One thing to be aware with these deals, the workman often come to the house to assess what materials are needed then they go and get them. The trip counts against the hours you purchased. So if they are going for the part during rush hour, kiss one hour good buy."

The time it took them to go get the stuff shouldn't have been counted as the time they were here. The work that they did do resolved the issue that we had.

The work went smooth and he did a really good job. My wife an I are very satisfied. We are now looking at the next small job on the list to have JW do for us.
5,"Ever arrived on time and did exactly what I asked of him. He was courteous, efficient and thorough. There was one item that could not be fixed because of cabinet weight (settled over time so tracks for sliding cabinet doors were no longer tight). He made some good recommendations on next steps and I shall be following up with the company."
2,They did not paint the window box. That would not have been so bad if he had used white calking. Instead an off white calking was used. Also they did not respond to my request for an update invoice.
4,"It went alright. I paid $50 more than the deal. I wasn't necessarily satisfied with the heels that he put on the columns. They were kind of sloppy. Other than that, everything else he did was great. They were fine. There wasn't any dirty work. The price was pretty good with what I needed done. They were there pretty early."

5,"The company came out twice. The first time was for an estimate and the second time was to do the actual work. The estimator was very polite and explained how the company worked, how he put together the estimate, and what the variables in the estimate were. He then took some time to look over another piece of work that I was thinking about having done. Even though I did not want a formal estimate h...

He checked out what I was proposing and told me how they would plan to carry out the work and if he foresaw any issues or if I needed anything. He was very efficient and called the office with me there to set up the appointment to have the work done the following week. This first step was absolutely perfect--I could ...

5,Went great - Cesar & Reggie did an excellent job!!!!
4,"The estimator came to make sure that I had enough work for the amount of time purchased (no worries there!) & give price quote. I signed up for a lot of work on my carport, back porch, and gates as there were a lot of minor things that needed to get done. One of two workers showed up on time on first day (other had family emergency) to see what needed to be done. Was told I wouldn't be charged for...

5,"JW did a great job. The office staff was friendly and helpful, and scheduling the estimate and dates of work was easy. When we made a last minute change to the work that needed to be done, they were able to rush an estimator back to our house to look at the changes and update estimates the Friday before the scheduled work on Monday. On Monday, Chris and Raymond were sitting in their truck outside ...

Tony wrote up the order and took pictures so that when Ever arrived to do the work, he had the correct materials and no time was wasted. The Angie's deal was for three hours and Ever was able to complete the work and clean up within in those t...

I have to agree with this grade also. When they came to give an estimate, there was a $50 fee which is applied to the final cost. I decided to install a bathroom fan at the same time since they were coming ou...

5,"Josh was right on time, had a nice sense of humor, and commented on what the carpenter might have to do and items he would have to purchase. He also looked at another possible project, which would depend on how much time was left. I had purchased an Angie's deal for four hours of carpentry work."
3,"The estimator who came out initially was very pushy and was trying to upsell me and seemed unsure if any of the work I needed to have done could be done in the 4 hours I purchased through the Angie's List Deal which seemed ridiculous to me. It was very obvious that he was trying to upsell me. He also practically begged for an excellent review on AG so he could get a bonus. I was very turned of to ...

5,Scott and Chris arrived on there and ready to go. they understood what I wanted done and did it correctly and nicely. It was very cold so they warmed the materials in the house (necessary) It was a small but necessary job. They were professional.
5,"Alberto and Kevin are wonderful! they arrived on time and were totally prepared for the job with all the tools and hangers they needed. They work really well as a team and were. So quiet, I barely know they were here. Both are great people and nice gentlemen. The work they did is fantastic!"

They looked over the top proposal realized they would need an extra day and did not feel comfortable in putting a return in the wall and getting painting down one man’s stayed behind and did repair the other left for home depot. The first man came back with supplies and they broke for lunch. Tires supervisor come not and added extra way are!

4,"Zach, the installer, was good & professional. I was not happy w/the estimator who was not ok. Did not have a tape measurement w/him. Estimator brought rating down. Too many surprises."
3,"The work on the door frame was okay, but we had to have an electircian adjust the security lights because they did not work properly as installed by this company. The main issue is that the work was way overpriced. First experience with an Angie's ""Deal"" and I would not again purchase a so-called deal. I think the deal is for the provider, not the customer. Just like when vendors send out coupons ...

He we very efficient and completed the work in 4.5 hours even though I had booked him for between 6 and 8 hours. Unfortunately, he finished the shower stall while I was at a lunch meeting, so I didn't hav...

So obviously points deducted for the work needing a repair of that magnitude only a few months after instillation. Having said that, JW accepted this was warranty-covered without hassle (their policy covers a year from work), and got someone out before the storm hit. Jus...

5,Luther & Rolando did a very good and quick job. I was very satisfied.
5,it went well. Responsive and really able to fix things that I thought were no fixable.
5,"Easy to make appointment & came out the next day. Work went over for time bought but job wasn't done completed well. Our front door would close but not lock so it was unsecure. Another worker had to come out, rebuy supplies, fix the door. I'm hoping not to be charged for the extra time initially needed since the door wasn't fixed properly the 1st time. No invoice this time."
5,"Janaka was on time, professional, and very polite. The work was completely done within the same day. He only took a break to obtain additional supplies. I would use if possible, Janaka De Silva in the future."
5,"Glenn Spilman Glenn arrived actually early and he performed all requested service – polite, professional and easy to work with – works was completed as requested and all areas left in good order."
5,"Ever & Joe did a great job ! They were on time, neat, called with questions, and improvised a couple of fixes. Will definitely use again."
5,Janaka was on time and was thorough.
5,The estimator was on time and professional. He presented several options and we defined the job to fit into the Angies' deal. Several days later the worker was on time and completed the job as promised.
5,Glenn Spilman was extremely knowledgeable and realistic about what could be accomplished during the three hours allotted by deal. He explained what he was doing and offered tips where I could do things on my own instead. Overall experience was fantastic and especially can recommend working with Glenn.
5,"On time, steady workers, offered excellent materials, fine workmanship."
4,They were fine. They were okay for the service delivery. I just found that they are always a lot higher than what the deal would cover. I found that irritating. The people who came out and did the work were fine. Their original estimate was $1600 and I think it ended up less like $900.
5,"These gents were on time, very polite, professional, & did an excellent job. Happy to recommend them!"
5,"Zack my technician was on time. He greeted me respectfully as he identified himself. Upon entering he asked to see the work to be done. He then proceeded to locate the nearest home depot so he could pick up the hardware and materials to do the work. He left to make the purchases. He returned in a timely manner and began the work in a professional and timely manner. He asked if the jobs were comple...

His estimate was accurate and the overall price was reasonable. The team that came out did a great job (I forgot their names-sorry!). Everything was completed quickly and with quality. Some of the items ...

5,"Scott, the handyman, arrived on time. Very friendly and helpful. We needed to have a banister installed due to my upcoming knee surgery. Scott made sure the banister was at a comfortable height for me to use and that it was securely installed. He did a great job."
5,"The job took 3 visits and more time and money than estimated however, the quality of work was very high. We had a faux texture and paint job that we thought would be impossible to duplicate, but Sung did an absolutely amazing job! The company made up for previous miscommunication, and the quality of work was great, so we plan on using this company again."
5,"Everything went great, the work by Janaka was excellent, very professional and personable employee. We had no issues whatsoever."
2,This was ok. They ended up taking more time and I wasn’t very pleased. The thing that bugged me was that he went to Home Depot on two hours of my time. I don’t think the guy was an expert on weather stripping so I wasn’t impressed.
5,"Chris and Scott were excellent. They explained everything clearly, made adjustments to do the best job, and finished promptly."
5,"Scott was on time (early, in fact) and was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. He had to make a trip to Home Depot for parts and returned promptly to finish the jobs."
5,"On Dec 28, Justin arrived on time and completed the varied tasks. He was very pleasant and extremely neat and considerate. On Dec 31, I had treable with the connector on the light he installed. I called the office and Justin came right over even though it was his day off. Yeah, Justin!"
5,"Chris was here on time and started on the door while his partner, Ray, was finishing another job. They both worked diligently and did a really good job of measuring, mitering and cutting. A job well done. We would use them again. Friendly, professional, skilled."

5,"The estimator, Josh was excellent, he was thorough, and his estimate was spot on. Kenny, the handyman was exceptionally punctual, very nice, and performed excellent work. Always had excellent experiences with JW and this was another one."
4,We received a free estimate to get some work done around our home. We did receive a quick response from the provider. They were courteous and professional. Due to the estimated cost at the time it was more then what we had budgeted for. We will keep them in mind for future home improvement projects.
5,"Scott was on time, very polite & informative. He let me know exactly what was needed to be done. Very professional & made sure the area was clean. He did the job & made sure it looked good & worked properly."
5,Our JW Home Improvement experience was excellent. The crew was professional and courteous the entire job. The job was complete on time and under budget. I highly recommend JW Home Improvement and will most definitely use them in the future.
5,"The front office staff of JW Home Improvement very clearly explained how the Angie's Deal worked. The deal included 3 hours of time but no material. I had the choice of buying the material myself (which is what I chose) or having the tile man buy them at cost. We set up an appointment for Tony, the estimator, to come out the next day. He showed up exactly on time and told me what grout and caulk w...

5,"The service was all we had hoped it would be and the company is now in our Rolodex for our future handyman needs. Note that the $199 cost was a special rate for first-time customers. Future work will cost more. The service provider was punctual and efficient. He finished quicker than we had anticipated and we should have had more work lined up for him to do during our 3-hour promotional price. He ...

The longer list would've cost several thousand dollars and it was valuable to put a price on a combination of both our needs ...

They had someone come out beforehand and sent somebody else out who wasn't prepared based on what had been told. I got some stuff done I needed to get done and that was fine. I'm not going to use them again. It took a little longer. So, it cost a little bit more."
4,"It was fine. I've had them here a couple of times. It was for three hours of work and it turned out it didn't really take three hours. They were satisfied and I was satisfied. They had estimated that the job was going to take five hours and it actually took two. Since it was a small plumbing type thing, I really thought they should have done better on the estimate.

I am very happy and it restored my faith in JW. Raymond did a tremendous job. It was not easy at it was freezing out today but he did the work professionally and cleaned up the area."

I have never had to pay in full upfront and find this unreasonable. I refused to pay and then the repairman said he would call me the next day with an estimate and I never heard from him or the company again."
5,Josh was great. He arrived early and worked to provide the estimate and get me the best deal. He also ensured the work got scheduled to accommodate a time when I can be home. I won't really know how accurate the estimate is until the work is done in January.
5,did a very nice job - Cesar and Rene were punctual and professional and very helpful

He noticed some wood rot on the trim above the garage door and on another window. I as...

We purchased the 6 hour package but went over by 2 hours. They simply billed us for the overage and all was well. The repairman was very professional. He put us completely at ease and his work was top notch. Prior to the repairs there was a...

Called the office and set up the day and time for completing the work. JW called a day ahead to remind me of when the workman would arrive. The workman called before arriving letting me know he was on the way. He inspected each r...

This morning I had the very pleasant experience of having Tony Cline from JW Home Improvement to come to my home to give me an estimate on a job which consisted of removing an old bathroom vanity, picking up the new vanity from a nearby home improvement store and coming back to install the new one.. Tony was very pleasant to work with, He assured me that my description of the work that ...

5,"This worked out perfect. First, days before the work was performed, I found the same deal with same company for 4 hours instead of 3, which is exactly what I needed. I did half of the work myself to save money, but needed to bring in a professional to help finish laying the insulation and lay the platform. JW agreed to provide a single person to do the work. Ignatius was the carpenter that showed ...

5,"During my initial call to J.W. Home Improvement I scheduled an appointment for an estimate with Tony. J.W. charges a $50 estimate fee up front when you call to schedule the appointment but it is credited back to you if you have services performed. I was fine with that. My meeting with Tony was only a couple of days later and he arrived promptly at the meeting time and was very personable. Tony lis...

5,"Surprise success: During process of work behind shower, they discovered a leak which had not been found by 2 other plumbers & 3 men in my family. This had been a mystery, off & on for ""25 years."" They repaired it & took care of damage. Other surprise: Sub-floor was cement with damaged plywood beneath. They took care of all. Prompt, very efficient, very expert. Cleaned up well!"
4,"It turned out okay. The job was a little messy, but I got what I needed done. There was no additional cost. There was glue everywhere. The service itself is really good. Outcome depends on who you get to do the work. But, everyone is really nice."
5,"windows, flooring. He knows the work, knows how to talk with people and is a straight shooter. The fact that the home is 100 years old is enough to make you realize that there are challenges. The professionalism of JW Home Improvements demonstrated that I could rely on the work. There are some areas that I plan to get work done soon on the exterior of the home. I will post again when they compete ...

3,This provider has a two step process. They send someone out to provide an estimate of the work and then you are scheduled to get the work done. I found the process to cumbersome and time consuming to pursue and asked for a refund.
5,The work came in on-budget. Their carpenters did excellent work and were very professional. They arrived on time and stayed in touch about their schedule. I would recommend hiring JW.
5,"Chris, the carpenter, was excellent. He is a credit to the organization. He was competent, friendly and a pleasure to work with. One note: we purchased these services as an Angie's List ""Deal"". As such, the services were very economical and a great value. But the hourly rate that JW Home Improvement quoted to us for any services that exceeded the scope of the Deal would have been billed at twice t...

5,Zack arrived on time in a very professional way. Attitude positive and he was very respectful to us and our home. He cleaned up very well after himself. I would hire JW Home Improvement again and would love to have Zack back.
5,"Very well. Also pointed out that 6 window sashes did not close well, leaving room for air leaks. This was above and beyond the contract. I later bought insulation and fixed the problem myself and almost no cost."
5,"As soon as the purchase was made through Angie's List, communication with the company began. They were very friendly and easy to work with. We set a date for the estimator to come out and he was there right on time and explained how everything worked and made informed suggestions - ultimately estimating necessary time to complete the project.

However, I purchased a deal for 6 hours of handyman services and, frankly, expected a lot more on my to-do list to get done. The business model doesn't make sense to me. I would think it makes more sense to have the person doing the actual work to come out to give the estimate, not a separate individual. ...

5,Because the wood that was damaged was on the upper corner of the house and three stories up this required a two man job. (a 40 foot ladder was needed so a single person couldn't carry the ladder) Job took 6.75 hours.Had 4 hour Big Deal Coupon. All work was completed-looks like new.These guys do nice work!
5,"Thomas arrived on time and was finished on time as well. All the work was completed within three hours, that includes set-up and take-down of ladders and tools. All the shutter against the house have been re-secured. They have become lose over time and were close to falling off (as well as banging against the house with high wind). I couldn't be happier with the work that was done."

2,"I did not hire them because the rates are very high. $174 for first hour and $124 for each hour after that and can be billed in 15 minutes increments.

My only complaint is the cost, but they are responsive, prompt, professional, reliable, etc. They do good work. Some advice: I did save money by finding, purchasing and picking up the fan myself, because they would have charged for that."
5,"Very professional and work was of great quality. Definitely helped to clear up a good portion of our ever-growing chore list! The way they structure their rates, it is definitely worthwhile to compile a list of items and have them done all at the same time versus having them come out to complete a single task each time (the first hour of service is more expensive than each subsequent hour)."

4,Deck looks good. Only issue was the time needed to complete the job was really underestimated. The company did provide some compensation.
5,They cleaned it out and all is working well.
5,"Better than anticipated. From scheduling with Lynn to having Wade perform the work, we couldn't be more pleased. Well worth the price. Everyone was sincere, professional and easy to work with."
5,"I forget exactly what we had done aside from some drywall repairs for minor water damage, but our handyman was excellent, seams were invisible. He also noticed some worn corners in a few hallways and fixed them up so they're nice and square again. Would not hesitate to call them again."
5,Excellent. From the initial call to set everything up to the technician finishing the job was a great experience. Will definitely be using them again.
5,"I called the company and the young lady was very helpful. She explained the service that could be done, how much it approximately would be, and worked very hard to get a service person out as soon as possible. When there was a cancellation, she called with a possible earlier appointment. Very good customer service. Don arrived early and was ready to work. He was very pleasant and listened to my de...

5,"Mr. Handyman and specifically Jerimiah, couldn't have been more professional or done a better job. We are completely satisfied."
4,"Mr. Handyman (Dick) arrived about 10 minutes late, which wasn't a problem. He was very professional and polite. My issue isn't with the services provided, but the estimate and perhaps the type of work (not the handyman's fault, but the saleswoman). The cost is $154 the first hour and $104 each additional hour (in 15 minute segments). I provided photos of the workspace as well as measurements. I st...

5,"The cost depends on how long it is going to take. They have been good at responsiveness. They have been on time. They are very professional. They came out very quickly after I called, looked it over, and gave me some ideas of what they were going to do. Two people came out and they are very nice, friendly, and know what they are doing."
5,"He was punctual and professional. All work was very well done. He cleaned up all project work. He was personable and expert. The one thing i would have changed would have been to identify ahead of time exactly what items he might have needed, as he had to go out to get some things which i did not have on hand."
5,"Our handyman, Jeremiah I believe, was great. Very knowledgeable, capable, and a nice guy too."
5,"The stuff seems to have gotten done. They're really quick. They had to reschedule sometimes, but I don't think that's the same as being late. One of the things that stood out is that they have the appropriate license for the work that they are doing. Because prior to using them, I had used some people that I had gotten through a different set of recommendations, not through Angie's List, and that ...

5,"I would use again in a heart beat. The price was reasonable, and work was done much more quickly than I expected. Also, I appreciated that my house was left very clean after substantial dust was created."
5,"It went great. Mark was very professional on the phone. He was able to send one of his workers out a day or two later to look at the jobs and provide an estimate. His price was as good as or a little cheaper than a couple other estimates I got. The shed floor turned out great. Regarding the drywall, they went to the trouble of waiting for the spackle to dry, and came back the next day to sand it. ...

5,Very professional and on time. Very good!
5,"The price was pretty good. It was very urgent and I inquired from a bunch of companies who didn't have time. They were able to send out a guy rather quickly and got the work done. The settlement happened on time so they were very good. When you call them up, they give you a time slot rather quickly and the quality of the work was good. The work passed the inspection. I think for the small job that...

5,Wade was on time and so professional very pleased with all the work he did. Lynn was also very helpful and patient with all my questions!
1,"If you have a smaller project or projects don't waste your time calling. They asked what types of things I needed done. I provided an exhaustive list of small projects as examples but said they didn't all need to be done at once and I was most concerned about getting 3-4 outside things done before it got cold. He asked what the prior people who failed to show up to complete a job charged and when ...

5,"Wade was a true pleasure to have in our house, the exact kind of person you have complete trust in and feel comfortable leaving in your house. He showed up on time and ready to work. The first task was hanging a complicated crystal chandelier with a lot of crystals. My kids were so excited that they monitored everything he did. I really appreciated how professionally and kindly he dealt with them,...

5,Mr. White has done work in my home before. He does a very good job.
5,"I was impressed with the provider from the first phone call. Alan knew right away that they could help, anticipated my questions about insurance and rates before I could even ask, and explained the limitations of service upfront. On the day of service, Dick was on time, friendly, and VERY knowledgeable of what needed to be done. He knew what caulking needed to be totally replaced, and what ones ju...

Because of the reviews here I decided to give Mr. Handyman another shot and called directly. The person who answered (I'm terrible with names) was very apologetic about the online inquiry issue. I explained what I needed (I only had a rough idea since there were so many little odd jobs like...

5,"Ken called to let me know when to expect Don. He arrived right on time, reviewed everything that needed to be done.(I added some things. originally it was to just hang the TV) Then Don got right to work. Neat, clean, efficient and personable We couldn't be more pleased. Will definitely call again and recommend others!"
5,no drama. all went very well
5,"We were very pleased. I called Monday morning and scheduled the visit for Tuesday. After discussing whether they could paint the wood (the trim was on the second level of our house, Ken moved it back a day to give us time to get the paint. Scheduling was very easy and professional. Handyman did arrive on the date scheduled. I had left the office a message that I would be in a training all day and ...

5,"The handyman arrived promptly and tackled the varied task list without any issues. He let me know when we needed a specialist (window repairs) and handled the rest in good time. The rates are a tad pricy, but the service was worth it for the short timeframe in which I needed to have the work done."
5,Came same day. Great communication from dispatch. Worked quickly and did a fine job for reasonable price.
5,"I've had this company do work for me twice in the past year and the people who have come have been very capable, professional, friendly and willing to do even the simplest tasks. They've also been honest in telling me when a task is not one they can do, which I appreciate."
5,"It went very well. I was called a half hour before they came just to give me a heads up. The gentleman was very courteous, quiet, just came in and did the work I asked. He was really efficient. And they man who answers the phone when you call to schwdule(Allen) also called back after the work was done to make sure everything went well and I was okay with all the work the handyman completed. The wh...

5,"Can't say enough good about them. Fast, efficient, and extremely high quality. You might find others that will cut corners and come in slightly cheaper, but you'll pay more in the long run because the quality will likely not be as good."
5,"Dick, our handyman, was on point. I told him the issues and he got right to work. He fixed all issues we had. He explained everything he did and gave me advice for maintaining the door. I only wish I had more for him. I'll be creating that list and contacting Mr. Handyman again. They also followed up with a phone call to make sure service went well."
5,"They were prompt, courteous, professional and completed the job as well as expected."
5,Overall they did a good job and were at the home for around an hour.
5,"Don came out and diagnosed the problem as some light mold in spots and blistering paint in multiple other spots ( an 8 X 11 foot area). He went out to purchase some materials to fix my problem. When he returned, he taped plastic to all of the walls, in the area he would be working. Put down drop cloths to cover the furniture and carpet. He sprayed the mold with a mold control product after scrapin...

But he addressed all the issues that I originally had him come in for. He fixed the leaky faucets in the bathroom, he fixed loose stair barristers, we needed some grouting in one of the showers, he fixed some light fixtures ...

5,"They did a really good job. They were a little pricey, but I am very happy with the service that I got."
5,"I was impressed by the fact that Jeremiah didn't only replace the drywall tape but explained to me his concerns before thoroughly investigated why it was peeling off. He did such a great job of re-taping the area and spackling it that it doesn't need to be painted. The patch he did where he removed the smoke detector is almost invisible even before it is painted. He also took great care in getting...

5,They showed up on time. They fixed everything in a timely fashion. I'd definitely use this company again.
5,They're great. I spent about $134. Everything that they did I liked. We had a book shelf that didn't have a back to it and he put a back on it and he installed a couple overhead ceiling fans and he also put in a sump pump.
5,The repairman was on time. He quickly assessed the requirements of the the situation and was very efficient. It was my first time using Angie's List to find a repairman. It was an excellent experience!
5,"He arrived on time. After I explained what was required, he went right to work and methodically completed all the tasks and the final outcomes all were excellent. He was very pleasant and great conversationalist as well. I was 100% pleased with the experience and definitely will call Mr. Handyman again when I have repairs or improvements that are needed."
5,Work was performed on time and at the price quoted. Area was cleaned when work was completed and to satisfaction.
5,"My experience with them is good. They were professional, friendly and knowledgeable."
2,"The call center took down all my information including a description of the work I needed, which was drywall repair/replacement and laminate flooring installation. The local rep called me back and said they don't do that work, when in fact, that work is listed on their website of services provided. Guess they just don't want my money."
5,"Very professional. Jeremiah was on time, very competent and both pleasant and polite. Very well done. I would definitely use them again."
5,"Jeremiah arrived 15 mins early. We went over the items on the To Do list and he had helpful suggestions regarding an outside tap and the electrical outlet. He quickly cleaned out the gutters before going to purchase additional materials. This took a little longer than anticipated as he had been unable to find the materials he is accustomed to using and had to make another stop and search a bit for...

Well, Mr Handyman owner, Alan, could not have been nicer. He had a man at my place Saturday at 9am and the work was completed in 2 hours. Paid via credit card and reciept emailed to me. Thanks."
3,"Weather played a major issue in the completion of this job, however the first day I was scheduled for work they cancelled on me an hour before. The overall quality of the work was not the quality I would have expected from what I paid. I ended up having to touch up the paint myself. In part this was due to the fact that I was not there to supervise myself. They never came at the time we had set up...

Contractor arrived on time in uniform with company truck. I explained the job of removing attic stairs and installing new stairs. I had bought a set of stairs that was too small but he was able to frame it in and make it work. All in ...

4,Several different workers. There was a variance of work quality.
5,Jeremiah arrived on the job early and was ready to work. I walked him through all the projects and then we talked about pricing. He was very skilled and all the work was completed looks great. This company is expensive but I think you get what you pay for.
5,"Excellent job. Looks like they have been there all along. Very professional and courteous. Doug called us in for any style, placement decision. Other than that, he knew just what to do and how to do it. We're delighted. Okay, what I really mean, is my wife is very happy, which makes me happy."
5,"Our technician was Jeremiah who arrived at the scheduled time. He was very personable, efficient and skillful person. Several years ago, we had contacted a handyman and wanted several of the things on the above list done.

Their earlier appointment ran late, so they called to let me know, then confirmed that the technician was buying the materials. He came then the owner came to assist.

He also explained the pricing and recommended I buy my own supplies to save myself some money. The handyman that came confirmed that that saved me a lot of money. I got a call the morning the handyman was scheduled to come saying that he would be a few minutes l...

4,Very well. The young carpenter did all the work. He had to go to Lowes/Home Depot for the replacement wood and stain. (I had purchased the light fixtures.) He charged me for the materials and minimal extra time. I was very satisfied with all the tasks.
5,"Mr. handyman was late about one half hour on the 1st day. Other than that one time, punctuality was good. He promised to call me each day after he finished his work, but I never got a call. Those with only problems. The work done was quality work and I'm quite pleased with the result. I can now enter my home through the front door with my power chair. In my home is more secure new deadbolts, in fr...

5,I was pleased with the work they did.
5,"Came on time, completed work, cleaned up."
5,"They came the same day that I called. They were on time and it only took them about 15 minutes to do the work. I had purchased a unit for $138 from Home Depot because I thought they would need the piece, however he told he didn’t need it. I was able to take it back and get a refund, so they ended up saving me some money as well."
5,"They charged on an hourly rate and they were expensive. However, they did a great job."
5,"I called Mr. Handyman, Alan, and explained to him it was an unusual job but after some discussion and feedback, I decided to go forward. The young man who came out was professional, on-time and friendly. I explained the service I needed completed and he got to work. When I returned at the end of the day I was very happy with the results. The workmanship was spot on and the detail was excellent. Ba...

It was a good time for me, so he came out, looked over the job, put down a drop cloth, asked where he could access water, and then brought his tools in. He did a great job covering the crack in the ceiling and when he left, it wasn't quite dry, but looked much b...

Their price was good compared to the other estimates I got. I was not actually home when the work was completed, I was at work and my housemate was home instead. I would have asked for the mudding to be smoothed out a bit more, but I can't fault them for ...

5,I think they did a good job and the workman arrived when he was supposed to. He was very courteous and friendly; I think he did a good job. I think the price was a little high for the amount of work that he did but it was something that needed to be done so it was fine. He was only here for a few hours.
5,They were fine and they did exactly what they needed to do.
5,"They really did an excellent job. They were responsive, punctual and professional."
5,"My 1st experience with this company and angie's list was very positive. I discussed that repairs were needed to the siding of the house and the contractor, Jeremiah, was out and fixed it within 2 days. He came out when they said he would. Jeremiah noted that the siding was originally installed incorrectly and that an option would be to replace vs repair it. I decided to just have it repaired for n...

5,He completed all the repairs correctly and quick. He was all business and everything he fixed is working properly. I was satisfied with his work but I do feel he could have completed the work a little bit cleaner which is just a minor detail. On a scale of 1-10 I would give him a 9.
5,"We were impressed from start to finish. We have done a lot of remodeling on our 1920's bungalow ourselves over the years so we appreciate what goes into labor.

5,"They were on time, and they got the job done quickly. They were very thorough."
5,"Great company. Honest, punctual and stands by their work"
5,It was a very good experience. The name of the person who came out was Peter and he was very efficient. He seemed to know exactly what he had to do and did it and did it in good time. He cleaned up after himself. I would use them again in the future.

5,"It looks terrific. He measured thoroughly and always asked us what we wanted before doing anything so it was just how we wanted. He was a little slow which did effect price, but I think it was because he was being so careful, which we really appreciated."
5,Everything was great. Very professional and punctual. Were willing to come out same day. We will definitely hire them again!
5,Excellent from start to finish. Couldn't be happier
4,"They are pretty good. I haven't had any problems with them. It is the second thing I have had done. The price is a little high, but their service is worth it. I had to call back a couple of times to get them so I can't give them highest marks for responsiveness. I will use them again in the future."
5,"I called Mr. Handyman in the morning for an estimate to install a new over the range microwave. They were able to have someone out in the afternoon of the same day to complete the job! The technician was on time, very friendly, very clean and very fast. I highly recommend Mr. Handyman."

3,"Overall, the experience was okay. He was able to find & fix the leak, but he ended up cutting a hole in the ceiling of my living room without offering any way of fixing the hole, even if there would have been an initial charge. He stapled some Saran wrap on the ceiling where the hole is. Now I'm in the process of fixing the ceiling hole through another vendor."
5,"The project(s) went very well and were completed in less time than I had expected. The technician was very competent, professional, personable, and well organized. He also provided some valuable tips and advice regarding a couple of other issues."
5,"Chris with Mr Handyman was EXCELLENT!! He completed several handyman tasks on my ~80 year-old home this fall. He was efficient, professional and very pleasant. He completed the work more quickly than anticipated, and made helpful suggestions for cost-saving options. He even cleaned up after himself! I will definitely use him for my future handyman needs."

5,Great. They came when they said and did the work quickly and well.
5,"He was great. The whole experience with this company was great, the went way beyond what most companies would do. Since I live out of state they made me feel very confident about my property. I will use them again and recommend the to others in that area."
5,"Mr. Handyman called me back. After I explained what I need to have done, he told me that this particular job really required a licensed plumber. So he gave me a referral to a plumber and I have been very happy with the referral. I really appreciated Mr. Handyman's honesty, professionalism, anmd integrity."
5,"The service is extremely professional and convenient to use. Great for an out of town landlord. They take time to explain work etc. Rates are high given that I've found good handy men for ~$50/hr etc. However, if you need to insure you get a dependable and trustworthy contractor, this is an excellent option."
5,"They were very professional, responsive and easy to work with in all cases. I actually referred them to several of my friends and will use them in the future."
5,"He was punctual and very professional and courteous. He did an excellent job, and even went to the store to get the right shade of paint since the one I had was no longer good. He was neat and did not leave a mess. I was very happy with everything that was done."

5,"Extremely pleased. The project turned out better than I ever could have imagined. Their professionalism was exceptional. I felt comfortable leaving them my keys and they completed the bulk of the work while I was out of town.

5,"This is the best experience I have ever had with a home handyman (in 35 years of hiring them). I was doubtful based on past experience that this could go very well, but was so very pleasantly surprised. Not cheap, but given that he didn't waste my time or his, he had proper equipment, and he was knowledgeable I think it was well worth the cost."
5,"Chris was on time, very polite, and professional. He completed the job in a timely manner. The chair rail looks great. He cut each piece at a 45 degree angle so they fit together seamlessly. Then he caulked all the nail holes and seams. The only problem was that the job took longer than the manager had estimated on the phone, so it was more pricey than we originally thought. Other than that, we we...

5,They came and did a whole day's worth of work. The price was a little high but it's hard for a handyman not to charge that much.
5,The person that showed up knew what he was doing. He was easy to direct and worked efficiently.
5,Outstanding job. Very satisfied.
5,Very well.
5,They were very helpful.
5,"They were excellent. They had a 4-hour minimum. They were extremely good. Whatever I asked the tech to do, he did. I would certainly hire him again. He cleaned up and everything was left in fine condition. The price was good because it would have been difficult to coordinate that many different people to do the various jobs."
5,The time to do the requested jobs was pretty much on target. I felt like they were using their time wisely and efficiently. This fellow that they sent out clearly knew what he was doing and was able to tick the items off the list that we needed.

The quality of the work was excellent so the cost wa...

5,"Mr. Handyman showed up at the time appointed, dressed in a uniform and driving a Van with a Mr. Handyman advertisement on it. This was good because I live in a small condominium and it is reassuring to elderly neighbors. The A/C units had been permanently installed in old casement windows on the 2nd floor, so I was very reluctant to tackle the removal on my own. He had the units out very quickly a...

1,The owner never called to schedule an appointment or called to inform me that he had chosen not to do the work.
1,"Overall I would say that the project started well, and much of the work is good quality. Mike started working for us back in late November, and its now April. He has basically quit the job with a lot of touchups still outstanding. Mike’s Crew (Daryl, Mark, and Matt) were constantly late, and rarely worked a full day. Their inability to show up at a reasonable time and stay more than 4 or 5 hours p...

1,"I had rotted wood replaced on my garage and a shingle replaced on the house. After 5 months of replacement the shingle came off. I called the company 3 times and left messages to contact me. I received no response even though their tape message states they will contact you in 24hrs. I tried to e-mail to get a response and received none. Very unprofessional to not give any response to people they d...

5,"Mike Vecchio from The House Doctors is an absolute pleasure to work with. One of the few companies who actually came through with an estimate for a major rehab of my screened-in porch and other items. Mike's team (Mark and others) arrived when promised and worked on this job for several weeks until it was completed to my satisfaction. There were many facets to the job and the team was communicativ...

5,"I originally started with looking at concrete platform steps which needed footers that proved too expensive. The House Doctors provided me with alternate options using treated lumber and backfilling with gravel. I am very grateful to Seth and Mike for working with me to understand the challenges, come up with alternate solutions, and work within my budget. An excellent solution that ended up savin...

4,"The foreman of our project did a good job and was responsive to our requests to get things done in a professional manner. The owner of House Doctors set appointments to finish up the project after we had paid and then his men didn't show. This happened more than once. After a final walk through we paid, as indicated but over the next several days we determined the additonal cost for repairs did no...

5,"The project went very smoothly. Chris and Joe from the House Doctors were very prompt, courteous and competent. The remodel was completed ahead of schedule and looks beautiful. I'm looking forward to working on the next project with them."
5,fine. He also found damage to the bricks in the chimney and repaired those.
1,"Horrendous from the get go. Initial appointment they came without any of the tools to do the range hood install. After waiting weeks for appointment they had to reschedule. Told me they'd come the next day only to call me after id taken off work to say no they need to reschedule. Wait several weeks again.. Called me day before the next appointment to say they have to reschedule again. Everytime th...

5,"It was wonderful. The whole experience was very pleasant. The technician was polite and professional. He worked steadily the whole time he was here. He cleaned up after himself. He went out of his way for me because at the time I wasn't well. When we went to Home Depot to buy the supplies he went and brought me the handicapped shopping cart and taught me how to use it. At the end of the shopping h...

5,House Doctors did a really great job. Very happy.
5,"Seth was a delight to work with, personable yet professional. He explained the work and was very meticulous. Others were brought in to help with the list of tasks."
5,"Mike was a pleasure to talk to. His crew showed up on time and took seriously our pandemic-related concerns. The quality of the work met our needs. I liked that the crew leader suggested that they take care of a smaller issue in the basement while waiting for some of their work to dry, which would otherwise be down time for them. When the pandemic clears, we have a list of small projects that need...

5,"Great. Mike and Matt showed up on time. They were friendly and knew just what they were doing. They built a solid wood foundation and leveled it nicely. They told me when they arrived that some of these sheds are more time consuming to assemble than people might expect and got permission to stay longer if necessary. Turned out they got it all done very quickly and efficiently. It looks great. I've...

1,I suspect that the House doctor will show up at my house expecting his $165.00 service fee. Do I need to purchase the caulking prior? I just don't want any caulking I need something that will last. He never called me to discuss expectations or what has to be done. I am so frustrated. I do not know what to do. This is the worst experience I have ever had hiring a contractor.
5,"AMAZING! Great results, better than I hoped for! Seth is meticulous, professional and friendly! I couldn’t be happier!"
5,"Excellent , great communication. Did a great job."
1,"Contractor did not return my phone call/voicemail. Can not recommend when even a courtesy return call was not received. This was the first such repair I have had to make and had no direction. Was looking for guidance on repair, or at least materials, cost, etc."
5,Mark and Mike did an amazing job installing some bird guards on the outside of my bathroom vents. They were super nice and professional. Great sense of humor as well. I will be calling them for my future needs around the house.
5,It was great from start to finish. They worked in a professional and courteous manner. The quality of the work was excellent. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
5,"Excellent! Great communication, friendly, Did everything I asked. Hard workers. Perfect one stop shop for everything I needed to get done. Also they have deep cleaning service that is excellent. If you need help getting your house ready for sale, and/or cleaning I highly recommend House Doctors."
5,"I am so pleased with The House Doctors! They were super responsive via email, text, and phone during the entire process. They came out right away to give me a quote and outlined everything via email. They came out a few weeks later to complete the work and had two guys complete the project. The men estimated that the work would take 3 days and it only ended up taking two! I had a relatively compli...

1,"Terrible, they gave me a time frame never showed, never called!"
5,"Fantastic! My Mother was prepared with sheets to drape over the furniture and was planning on having a cleaning done afterwards. None of that was necessary because the crew covered every inch of the room with plastic sheeting. We were forewarned that it might be difficult to blend the patch with the rest of the ceiling, but ultimately it looks fantastic. We also had the crew examine the attic spac...

5,Very well. Brian was punctual. Clean. Professional and I sat with him while he worked and I was asking him questions and he was very polite and answered all my questions. I felt we knew each other for awhile. Definitely would hire him again and a matter of fact I already called him again
5,Our experience has been fantastic! Our elderly mother needed help with housekeeping and Lori has been amazing. She and Mom have developed a great relationship and Lori has been more than flexible with the schedule. We are very pleased with our experience!
5,Lori and Dawn arrived exactly on time. They quickly got to work and the house sparkled when they were done. Both Ladies were extremely professional and friendly. I am thrilled that I decided to hire the House Doctors for my house cleaning. Best decision that I have made in a while. I highly recommend the House Doctors.
5,"Besides $375 for a one man job that took an hour- I’m relieved because two separate 2-man crews from Home Depot could not and would not try to complete it. It sounds ridiculous after watching and seeing a working micro wave that it was such a process but the House Doctors saved the day! I will definitely call them again for our next handyman project. Super nice guy & I was super comfortable to hav...

When Mike came to my house to give me an estimate for the work to be done, as I was talking to him about the things that I wanted repaired and the work to be done, I was very impressed with his wealth of knowledge and as the homeowner, I really appreciated the fact that Mike explained to me in detail what they would ne...

1,I received an initial call in response to my request for a quote through Angie's List. No one showed up to the scheduled appointment. I have since left two voicemails over the past week to follow up and reschedule but have not received a return phone call.

5,"Lori and Dawn have now cleaned twice for me and do a fantastic job! The house just sparkles and smells so nice and clean when I get home. They let me know when they arrive, when they leave and are very pet friendly. I love that they will wash windows and pay attention to small details like my makeup mirror, even wiping down the refrigerator or sweeping off the deck if I ask. Great decision to make...

Great work! We are going to have The House Doctors do our whole list of repairs we've been putting off for years."
5,"In preparation for listing my home I had a laundry list of small things to complete. At this point I was already out of town at my new job and wasn’t able to work on these things myself. Mike and his wife Lori did a great job dealing with things like ceiling and trim painting, carpentry, and an entire deep cleaning including windows. They responded quickly, dealt with my hectic schedule, and got t...

5,The girls (Lori and Dawn) were AWESOME! They were very professional and thorough... They were extremely polite.. I will definitely be using their services again and again!! And will be recommending them to my family and friends..
2,"Called to schedule estimate. Lauri was nice and responsive. The day of the estimate Mike was running late. He was very nice when he showed up. I showed him different things like carpentry, the kitchen ceiling, and some plumbing. We discussed what he would do. He said he'd give me my estimate to me via email, I didn't receive my quote. I called the office and Lauri said she will have him call me. W...

5,Fine. Very satisfied. They are hard workers.
5,Jim did an excellent job successfully completing a long list of home repairs in a professional and timely manner. He gave accurate time expectations and suggested better options for solving lighting issues. We would defiantly hire House Doctors again!
5,"I have been extremely pleased with this company! I had initially hired the company for a deep clean. The work was done so well that I went back to them for a regular biweekly service (approx. 2,800 sq. ft with a pet). The ladies are very pleasant, reliable and thorough. On the occasions that I've been home, I've noticed that they NEVER stop working! I'm thrilled to have found such a good cleaning ...

Long story short: I was literally chasing this company down, for nearly a month, to pay for the service rendered....

5,"It was a big change from dark navy to creamy off white, and they did an amazing job. They arrived right on time. They helped rehang the curtain rods and did a lot above and beyond what I would have expected. I will recommend them to friends and family."
4,Mike and his workers did a great job. It seemed as though the ball was dropped by the front office. I needed to call multiple times and the lady on the phone was pleasant but seemed a little disorganized. Overall they did a great job and I would hire again.
5,"Courteous and prompt service in all the work throughout the year. Exelent attention to detail, and reponds promptly to manage the high quality of work."
5,"Mike and his team arrived promptly on the day of service and were friendly and professional. The work was completed and Mike left, but after seeing some pictures later in the day my fiancee wanted some changes made. Mike made time to come back out the same evening to do the additional work and was still very friendly. The banister looks great and is well built, and we are very happy with it and Mi...

5,"I was super impressed with the timeliness and ability to ask questions to help with project. I was told what exact door I needed to order and dimensions which made the decision easy for someone like me who doesn’t have time or skill to do these type projects. The door removal was complicated due to how the previous door was put in by former owner. The project took 6 hours due to it and I know that...

5,Mark was great! I would definitely have him again. Very pleased with how my door turned out.
4,"Accomplished promptly and professionally. I wanted to ask about something, but they left before I could do so."
1,"This went horribly. They first contacted me two days after I submitted my project need to Angie's List. That should have been my first sign of trouble. I then described my issue in detail to the woman who sets up the appointments for Mike and we agreed they would come to my house on October 12th between 2 - 3 p.m. to look at project and quote it. I told her this was an urgent matter as we can't cu...

5,Went well. The deck and front steps look very nice. They matched the stain perfectly on both.
5,Work went smoothly over several days. Very good attention to detail.
5,"The only reason for the 'B' in responsiveness is that there was a miscue between their office and the owner as to the appointment date and time. Date we were given was 6/26. The owner had our appointment for 6/27, so we waited all day on 6/26 for nothing. Now, the owner (Mike) did call us the evening of 6/26 and apologized profusely for the error. He had two young men come out on 6/27 and they wer...

My daughter’s room was perfectly painted with paint to spare. I would have given THD all A’s but the painter who arrived at my home was not very friendly when I spoke to him on the phone.

The only reason that we rated a B on price was that it wasn't the least expensive proposal on the tab...

5,"Very well. Lori and Kim were very pleasant and professional, and did a thorough job. They brought their own supplies. My furniture and mirrors shine, and the bathrooms are so clean and smell so good."
5,Did a great job on soffit which was very high up on very tall house blended repair in perfectly with existing molding to the point you wouldn’t know it was repaired unless you knew it was rotted. Repaired bed room ceiling and Spanish style plaster work perfectly and repainted so you would never know it was not original ceiling.
5,The service was exceptional at every level. Lori worked with me to re-schedule when the mailbox was not delivered on time. The gentleman who assembled and installed the mailbox did a great job. I’m very pleased.
5,This was my first experience with a professional house cleaning service and it was fantastic. Everything was done to perfection. I'll be calling House Doctors again and have already recommended them to several friends.
5,"Very well. Was a big job, in that it was customized for us. The entire bathroom had to be changed, to make it accessible for a walker. It is beautiful and functional. Everything we requested was done. Chris and Pat were always pleasant and professional, and kept us informed of any changes. They were helpful and made good suggestions."
5,"Lori and Erin are true professionals. They got right to work and stuck to their tasks. When they were done, everything sparkled and was as clean as a whistle! They saved me much time and labor. I am completely satisfied. I for sure would hire them again. And I will also recommend them to others."
3,"My provider was limited for time because I had a doctor's appointment, but the work that was done was not thorough. My bedroom was supposedly cleaned, however, the large closet floor was never done and the window sills were also not cleaned - I had to remind her. She cleaned the bathroom but neglected to clean the fixtures in the shower. I would have assumed she would know what to do. She did leav...

2,The roof repair estimation is twice of another company. When I told the Representative the next day when she called. She hung up the phone on me while I was talking. Won't recommend to anybody in the future.

5,Mike came right away to give us an estimate and was able to complete the work within a week. Very pleased.
5,"Very satisfied with results of the work as well as interactions with the House Doctors on bid, scheduling and job completion. Jim had excellent work ethic, was timely, efficient, easy to work with and did an excellent job."
5,I am relieved to have this work done
3,"No work was performed as no quote was received. I can't actually say if I would hire them again because I did not hire them a first time. I have nothing on which to base a review of their work, only their responsiveness and professionalism."
1,"A contractor from this company came to my home to do an estimate for the repairs covered by my homeowners insurance. After that, I haven't heard from them. My calls & emails were not returned. Have ended up hiring someone else. Am not going to call this company ever again and don't recommend."
5,"Had to work around the weather, but they stayed in contact and scheduling was not a problem. Very happy with outcome. It looks good, provider was professional and pleasant, worked well and took care of everything."
5,"The team did a fantastic job cleaning the house. They were friendly, hard working and willing to work around a contractor that was running behind. I highly recommend them for your cleaning needs."
1,"called left message, never received a call back"
5,The repairs were done very professionally
5,"This was a wood rot coupon appointment. I was glad that this company hung in there with me through a few obstacles. One was that my presence was sporadic due to a pressing family illness. The other was that we had to interrupt work a couple of times to eradicate yellow jacket nests. At the end though, I now have three solid windows, painted and well sealed. Thank you House Doctors."
4,"When I fist bought the coupon, a nice lady called to schedule but I was not yet ready. She called another time and I needed to get back to her. Then I called several times and could not get through, left messages. They did finally call back and we are all set up now."
5,"Great, the guy did a good job!! It was mostly for safety. I feel better that it’s fixed."
5,They were very professional and responded to my request for additional work.
5,"Great job by Mark. Punctual, polite, professional."
5,"Showed up right on time, tarped up the whole area, got right to work. When he left, everything was meticulously cleaned (given that it was drywall repair, that's not a joke!). Very happy about the job."
4,Okay. Contractor didn’t bring enough supplies and had to leave to pick up more.
5,"Arrived on time, got right to work. If you hire them, make sure you have a long list. They work fast and it is surprising how much can be done."
3,"For some reason he completed just a portion of the job and neglected to finish it 100%, which I discovered when I arrived home (it was an outside task). I just prorated the payment to him to be done with it."
1,"Awful. We called repeatedly to set up the service. They never called us back. The last time we called, the number was for ""Perfect Power Wash."" They have our money and we have nothing."
5,"Mark and Jim did an excellant job. They answered all questions, moved and protected furniture, cleaned up, took me to purchase material, arrived on time and worked really hard to get the job done."
5,Very well. Very nice ladies and they work very hard.

4,Did everything I wanted him to. Only hiccup was he was sent to my old address instead of the new address where the work was to be performed.
5,"He was on time, called ahead and told us what we needed. Excellent work."
5,"Outstanding quality workmanship from The House Doctors two man team, very prompt, professional, courteous, and timely execution and the crew paid attention to very detail of the job."
5,Very efficient and job looked great when completed...needed a deck of my sliding glass doors to the outside in the backyard...they built it stained and painted it and we are very pleased with the outcome.
5,Great! They determined and solved the problem.
3,They came out inspected the deck and furniture and said the washing wouldn't do any damage however after the job was done there was few spots on the deck where the stain had been removed exposing the wood. Overall they got the job done so i cant complain.
5,"Jim assessed the problem, explained what needed to be done and what materials were needed. He worked within the contracted time and completed the work with neatness and precision."
5,"They were on-time, courteous and professional. Did a great job! I'll definitely hire again."
5,"Great, l had final approval on all completed repairs. Good to find a company that would handle small jobs."
3,women was very nice but had to re-schedule on me last minute 2 different times. She finally showed up on our 3rd appointment. I asked her to only focus on a couple select rooms and just do a deep cleaning on those but it was very surface level.
1,"The contractor was 45 minutes late; Instead of repairing the wall he decided to cover it with 1/4 inch drywall. But he said I had to buy the drywall, screws, and spackling before he could start. I had planned to let him into the house and then go to work for a few hours. Instead we drove to Home Depot where I bought two sheets of drywall, a 5-gallon bucket of mud, and a box of drywall screws. Then...

5,"Came to the house, measured for wood trim. Bought trim & installed. Did nice job on trim & door."
1,I made an appointment with House Doctors for 8/14/2017. They never showed up to complete the job. I left two messages with them on 8/14/2017 about not showing up. They have made no attempt to contact me about the job that I hired them to complete in my home.
2,"I purchased a deal on Angie's and never was contacted by the company. I submitted the Angie's List scheduling request form, emailed their direct email address and called and left a message. After a month of no contact back, I asked Angie's List for a refund."
5,"I hired “The House Doctors” for the wood rot package. I thought there was going to be a problem as no one showed up at the arranged time, and no one called. After I called in twice, Jim, the man who was actually going to do the work called, and explained that his co-worker had had an emergency. I was pleased to hear that he could come later that day! I thought it was a bit odd that the office neve...

5,"They did an excellent job, even adding a few extra touches here and there (i.e. paid to paint upstairs shutters but also painted downstairs shutters to match, made slight changes to back deck at my request with no added cost.) The workers were friendly but focused; they worked hard from the time they arrived (between 10:30am and 11:30 am) till the time they left at the end of the day (usually 5:30...

Most of the contract details were communicated by email and they were always timely getting back to me with any answers or changes I requested. Pricing was slightly higher then quoted prices I received but the quality of work more than ma...

1,Took 2 weeks of missed and not responded t messaging to finally schedule appointment for cleaning. They didn't show nor call.
1,"I bought the $ 149 wood restoration deal on July 31st, scheduled the work for August 30th. They didn't show up the day of the appointment and didn't call to cancel or to apologize. I called the company twice, left messages and they never called me back. The worst is that Angie's List doesn't want to refund the money because is past 30 days even though is not my fault. The work was scheduled 30 day...

Tightened stair rail and even got out onto roof of porch, and caulked sky light window that was dripping with hard rain. VERY professional, helpful and didn't make me feel stupid (which is important to me!) Thank you Angie'...

5,"Punctual, professional, efficient. Also responsive to my specific needs."
4,It took forever to contact them and get a response. They came one day to look at it and told me they would have it done within 3 weeks. They actually came the next day and performed the work.
1,"Their discounted prices are reflected of the service. I will not work with this firm in the future, because of a complete lack of professionalism, an inability to answer the phone or respond in a timely fashion to a call or email, and for not showing up to an appointment. They wasted my time and I assure you will have no problem doing the same to yours. I would stay away at all costs, even if pric...

5,"Very well. The workers were not rushed but performed their tasks thoughtfully and thoroughly. I was particularly pleased that a few extras not included in the original quote were done to finish the job. I had not made a request for the extras but was thrilled to see that Jim had taken the initiative make the finished product look great. Mike the owner was responsive and communicated effectively.

1,"When they initially contacted me after purchase I was told they didn't have any openings for 3 weeks and I scheduled that. The week of the appointment they called on Mon to cancel the Wed appointment because they said it might rain (it didn't). They re-scheduled for the next week (now 4 weeks since purchase). On the day of the appointment no one showed up and no one called. After I called and left...

1,"The process started out well. House Doctors came highly recommended, and I knew they could do all of the work I needed. I met with Mike who took good notes and talked through the job, and seemed interested in the job. Unfortunately Mike never provided an estimate despite a followup phone call. I was unable to proceed with this company."
5,"Mark was conscientious, took 2 hours, cleaned up."
5,It went very well! No problems since then.
5,I was very happy with the results and will use them again and recommend them.
5,The plumber that I had worked with for many years from this company was not available. The plumber they sent out was good we just had a little problem getting dates and times set. The plumber was very knowledge and worked hard to get to the root of the problem and well as providing advice as to what is need in the future to prevent this problem .
5,Mark was great!! Worked efficiently and did a nice job
2,They came to your house without any kind of identification. They did not clean up after. It wasn't the best of jobs.
5,"Mike, the owner, was prompt in providing an estimate. He offered suggestions which would enhance the work we wanted done so we agreed to include that. They were able to schedule us quickly because of a cancellation and Mark and Jim arrived on time, even earlier than promised, which worked out well for us. They installed two new handrails with backboards for each on the walls of both stairwells. Th...

Called both the 440 and 216 numbers shown in their ad to ask if they were going to be late, or if they wanted to reschedule another day. Got voice mail at both numbers and left messages. It's been two weeks and still no response. By some of the reviews, I would have to guess that they do good work when they show up,...

5,Great. I am also getting estimates on future projects as I would hire them again!
5,The House Doctors cleaners showed up on time (2 for 1.5 hrs) and did an excellent job of refreshing the house -- it smelled great after they left! I would definitely hire them again.
5,"excellent job, fast and thorough, pleasant and friendly."
3,1st guy was done by a guy who was full of confidence but left pieces of glass everywhere on the ground. We didn't see it at 1st because dry leaves were all over the ground but there were shards of glass everywhere- very dangerous. The 2nd window was done weeks later by another guy & it was fine- all picked up.
5,It went very well. He was very detailed and put the stand together very professionally. It looks great in my living room.
5,"Instead of having to call one company for one thing, another for something else, and yet another for another thing, I just hand them my list of work and they get it done. I've used them numerous times, the approximate cost of service for this review is for the latest work they did. This time the work included regrouting exterior brick and a complete replacement of an asphalt driveway including add...

5,"Awesome. The workers were kind, polite, professional, and very hard working. I will be using them again."
5,2 women came to clean within 24 hours of the purchase and did an excellent job. The work was thorough and they were especially considerate of the fact that I was a cancer patient and coordinated their work around my need for rest during the 3 hour period they were there. Highly recommend their work and their consideration.
5,They were very professional. On time and worked hard. Was nice to have the areas cleaned that I needed focused on.
5,"Mike Vecchio is the perfect mix of friendly professionalism, and his quote for the job was what I thought it would be, so I accepted his bid right there and he fixed my siding the next day. His company does everything related to home maintenance and repair, and I was happy to find that his brother does landscaping, too. I look forward to doing business with this company in the future. Thanks, Mike...

So, terribly unprofessional. I only got 2/3 of my time and I found chipping on the wall under some dry wall he had repaired. Texted his boss and ""cool"" was the reply. Apparently, he thinks this passes as good servic...

1,"I initially called The House Doctors and left a message to schedule an estimate. Laurie called me back a couple days later and gave me a different phone number to call to schedule. I called this number several times over a three day period and nobody ever picked up and the voice mail was full. So I called the main number again.

5,They come in time and keep working for three hours for the move out cleaning. They are very polite and did a great job.
2,"This episode was disappointing at best. I hired a cleaning service to do things I am not physically able to do with my disabilities. What I don't like about Angie's List service is they take my payment first, before the contractor shows up. Sure, if they can't do the job they can turn it down and my money is refunded. But if they accept the job and then do it lousey, where am I? I spoke with owner...

5,"They were great, they showed up when they said they would and cleaned up after themselves."
5,Great! They did several small jobs and he was not a clock watcher. Neat and did a great job of cleaning up.
5,The cleaning was thorough and well done.
5,They showed up on time and were very friendly and their work was excellent. Jim was a very helpful and skilled worker and our stairs look great! Definitely worth the money and would hire them again.
5,Really well - the man who actually did the work did a great job. I did have some trouble getting an appointment for the second visit (multiple visits due to materials needing to dry before the next step in the process could continue). I would call them again for any job that I didn't have a super tight timeline on.
5,Good. Came to see what materials were needed then picked them up for me. I really appreciated this.
5,Everything went well with no problems.
1,"We played phone tag for a while and then they would not call back at all. When we call the number now it's ""Pristine Clean."" If we can't get the service we'd like our money back."
3,"The primer shows through the tan paint because he didn?t paint it well. He put 2 coats of primer and only 1 coat of paint. I have paneling that goes part way up the wall and the junction where the painted wall meets the paneling he left a white stripe around. He didn?t bring the paint down to meet the paneling so there is a white line that goes around it. I called to tell them the work wasn't done...

5,The work was done very efficiently.
5,"Great! They arrived on time, had clear understanding of project, gave true estimate of time and cost. We were kept informed of any issues and involved an all decisions. Work was perfectly performed, clean and neat. They matched existing wood stain, painted well and worked around 20 years of basement clutter without a word of complaint! All were polite and friendly."
5,Great experience. Jim was very detailed. Will use again.
4,"It was cold out and rainy, I think they guy didn't necessarily want to be here early. I probably should have rescheduled them another day. They cancelled once or twice. The work that he did do was very good. They're not as professional. Their price and work was excellent. Maybe I will use them again."
1,"i purchased a coupon for drywall repair on angies list. i needed my ceiling fixed because of a water issue in the upstairs shower leaking down into the kitchen. i had a lot of trouble getting the guy to come out when promised and when he finally did the repair he performed was actually a disaster. he speckled up the damaged ceiling and when it dried it was full of huge cracks. i ended up going to ...

5,Everything was done quickly and efficiently.
2,"The guy came in with a really bad attitude, as if he did not like his job. He used a curse word, and did a very sloppy job and dripped the drywall stuff down the walls. There was stuff all over my kitchen and floor. I found it two weeks later. I would never use them again."
1,After numerous contacts company came up with excuses and never showed up.
4,Fine. The quality of the work was not all that great.
4,He noticed the steps and offered to stabilize it. He said he had some spare wood in the truck and offered to stabilize it for me without additional charge. Even though he offered to do the stabilization of the steps he didn't paint the new wood. I would have appreciated him asking if he could paint the new wood to match the steps.
1,"They did not show for the first appointment-claimed the tech was in the E.R. When the tech did show, he looked around. The first thing he said was that he could only apply material that day-it wouldn't dry in time. He also wanted me to supply drywall topping, even though the agreement states that the contractor would supply it. He had a bag of quick-dry in his truck, which he didn't want to use-th...

So there was a bit of correction that he di...

5,It went really well! Everything is find & we are ready for the winter.
2,It went over the 1st day @ $45.00 but was never finished. The drywall was service was started and not completed on the ceiling. The House Doctor was supposed to call back on 9/15. Several attempts were made to reach them but they never made good on it.
4,"The problem with House Doctors is scheduling. They don't get back to you very quickly and it can multiple calls to get a response. The last time they were supposed to send 2 guys for two separate deals I purchased, they sent one(who was very good) who could only fill one order. No one called to let me know and no one has return a call I placed 2 days ago to try and reschedule."
2,"The work I wanted done on my deck would be best completed by taking the $129 and put it toward tearing out and putting in a new deck. He measured, and discussed how the material would be purchased before the project would start. He would put the order in at Home Depot and I would go in and pay for the material needed to build this deck and rails. I told him that I would be able to get a discount a...

First he applied the patches to the hole in our the backyard and he wouldn't paint it because he said that it was too high and then he said if we keep him, then we need to have some kind of contract for a certain job. So I agreed for him to do the job but then the timing didn...

It was difficult to reach a live person. This part of the service need...

4,Tim was very professional and extremely courteous. After he left I noticed several areas where paint was on the woodwork around doors. I wish he would have taped around them. He did tell me if I found anything to call and he would fix it. I did it myself because I didn't want the paint to dry.
4,Went well other than the service person needed to go purchase additional supplies. Would have thought there should have been an ample amount of patching compound brought.
5,Wainscotting needed to be replace so I had a longer visit and cancelled the special offer. Tim did my work and he is very knowledgeable. The work was reasonably priced. It turned out that I had some mold in one corner and dry wall needed to be replaced also. That was all done and done well.
5,I'm very satisfied with their service
5,Jim was great! He did a beautiful and efficient job. This only problem is that the office did not call me back promptly. They need to fix this part of the business.
4,"Jim was fantastic! He was polite, fast, skilled, and did an excellent job. The 2 window sills look beautiful. The only problems is getting in touch with the people who do the scheduling. I think they are overwhelmed and don't have a receptionist to take calls. So you have to play phone tag to schedule an appointment. It would help if one could communicate with them via email and schedule an appoin...

We set the day for the work (about a week away), and he and his able helper ar...

One moment, they'd tell me they weren't sure it was doable. The ...

1,I purchased a deal and scheduled an appointment. I called them three or four times and they never called back to let me know if they can perform the service or not.
1,"To use an old movie line "" what we have here is failure to communicate"" Left 3 voice mails, used online scheduling have not heard or seen any type of communication. Will be asking Angie to cancel."
4,"There estimate was extremely high. They were polite and helpful, it was just the price that I found excessive."

I think he could have got it done with the time allotted. There was an additional charge because they said that if it went over the three hours, there is going to be so much an hour.

I couldn't wait that long so I decided to go with someone else. They worked very hard to try and fit me in but it just didn't work out. They were very sorry for the inconvenience and apologized to me. They seemed very nice and understanding about the whole thin...

The gentleman arrived on time, completed the tasks, and cleaned up afterwards. He was professional and polite -- I couldn't have asked for more. I will definitely contact The House Doctors for future tasks!"
1,"Angie's List should have a new category for contractors that do not follow-up with homeowners. This seems to be the rule rather than the exception with contractors listed here. This contractor was quick to return my call, sort of quick to come to our house and review the work to be performed, and quick to promise us a write up for an estimate. Unfortunately that was the end of it. No follow-up, no...

5,She was prompt and thorough. I would use her again.
5,"Such a deal! They were on-time, cleaned up, but did not do finish work. Just so you know what to expect."
5,First time using a house cleaning. Kim was great. She offered suggestions and helped do some organizing on top of just cleaning. House has never looked better. I look forward to her next visit.
5,"They did a fantastic job. It was far, far beyond my expectations, in fact. Everything was picked up, dusted and wiped down throughly, vacuumed, corners and crevices were taken care of, window sills cleaned and more. I'm really happy with the job and would gladly call on them again."
5,The work went very well. The installer was on time and did a professional job with the installation.
5,Kim did an excellent job in both bathrooms. I especially like that she took down the blinds and washed them in the bathtub along with removing grit along the shower tracts. I was very pleased with the job she did on both rooms! Thank you! I will definitely call again in the future...
3,good job.
5,"Easy to arrange schedule. Got a call in the morning from the contractor - uh, oh, worried about the inevitable upsell. But that wasn't the case - he wanted to explain that the baseboard was quite a bit wider than the one I had supplied, and the vertical board had some millwork in it that wouldn't look completely like the regular board I had supplied. He could and did do the work with the materials...

5,"From the person who schedues the appointmets (Kim) to the person who did the work, I could not have asked for more pleasant and professional people. James, I think that was the young man's name, was on time and worked steadily from the time he arrived until he left. He finished the original job I asked for in less than two hours, so he was able to do the additional job of caulking. I have absolute...

5,"After reading the reviews and looking at the deal, I chose The House Doctors for my drywall work and am very happy I did. They were great! Quality work, professional and courteous! The best part, they even cleaned up at the end, taking the time to run a wet cloth over my floors to clean up the dry wall dust! I've had contractors who won't even clean up the scraps and wasted material, let alone any...

4,They were fine. There was a little mix-up with the scheduling dates. We had to keep scheduling it. The work was done a month later. The workers were professional.
5,"professional, courteous, cleaned up thoroughly, patched all issues I noted and found some additional issues in need of repair"
5,Very good service. I'm probably going to hire them again this summer.
5,"He was right on time, and he gave me a confirmation call 30 minutes before he arrived as promised. He cleaned up all of the paint scrapings. He was professional and very friendly."
5,Purchased a Big Deal for 3 hours of deep cleaning for $99. Arrived promptly at the scheduled time. Reviewed our list of priorities and quickly got to work. Did not quite finish everything on the list in the allotted time but did a thorough job in the areas that were cleaned. Would certainly consider using this service again.
5,"Service was great! Scheduler was very pleasant and accommodating. Service visit was on time as scheduled. The gentleman that came to do the work was pleasant, knowledgable, and thorough. He finished some molding on the main staircase and built out shelving in a kitchen pantry. His work was done well and he cleaned up after all was finished."
4,This was a big deal purchase. It was alright. They were not able to do what I really needed.
5,"He did a very nice job replacing what he could in the 4 hours of time I purchased through an Angie's List Big Deal. He showed me what problems were created by the need for a new roof - water damage that I did not realize could be a result of the old roof.He was pleasant, helpful, and professional."
5,"When Mike tore out the damaged floor of the corner cabinet under the kitchen sink, he found that the builder, Shore West, had left an open hole under the floor of the cabinet instead of properly ducting it to the register, thereby allowing moisture to accumulate under the cabinet. That is what caused the floor to collapse. He explained how he could fix it properly and offered us the option. After ...

3,"It did not turn out well. The deal just didn't go as I purchased. I purchased for $99 3 hours of carpentry. First of all they were late but they called to say they were going to be late. When they showed up, they had no information at all about what they were supposed to do. I had an appointment with the House Doctors to have the work done. I don't claim to be smart. They did work but they did not...

3,"I thought the price was a lot when I saw the finished product. I was expecting them to do a wood restoration that would make the wood look good and the wood did not look good. It does not look good. I know it was sanded down and all that. But, it does not look good. He explained that he did what he could with it. They could have been more responsive to my phone calls."
5,One time and did a good job.
4,"The guys brought out the compound and spackling. What happened was when he got to my mother's house he had some spackling but not enough to do the complete job. What he had on his truck was enough to do only one coat. He told us that after everything dries we'd need to sand it and do a second and maybe a third coat and then it'll be ready for painting. I would like for them to come out, sand, and ...

Only washed down my cabinets in a small L shaped kitchen, My cabinets did have grease on them but not 3 hours worth. And she used my products and...

5,"They came in, we walked through what I wanted done, prioritized the room needs and then proceeded to do exactly what I needed. They were wonderful, professional and very nice. Everything was professionally handled and they treated the house as they would their own. Thanks!"
5,"Provider was unable to come on original date due to staff illness. She agreed to do job herself the next day. She arrived promptly with one helper. They got started right away and worked very hard. They swept and mopped, cleaned tub and shower, wiped down cabinets and counters, stove and refrigerator."
1,"I used the Angie's List service to purchase a coupon for $99 of drywall work (sucker!) from The House Doctors back in January of 2015. I provided all of the information and provided 3 suggested dates for the work. Here is the note I attached to the job, just to give the reader an idea of the scope of the work: ""Several wall and ceiling areas need this service, including one large area in the ceili...

4,They did very well taking them down so i could paint them. Then they rehung them up for me. It went very well for everything...
5,Wonderfully professional. Very courteous. Took the time to learn what was my highest priority and accommodated my preference. Checked in to make sure they were meeting my needs. Very efficient. I would absolutely recommend these house cleaners.

Company returned call next day and set up appointment for a couple of weeks out. I called back discovering that I had a repair due date to meet--and responded to best ,meet my needs.

I needed a return trip because one of the areas needed to...

5,"I gave a B for quality, not because of the work, but because i had to buy a 2nd coupon to finish the job"
5,"The provider was prompt, courteous, and professional. She had all of her own tools and cleaning products. The provider explained what she was going to do and she did it. The rooms smell fresh and clean. The kitchen floor has never been cleaner. While not perfect, the provider put in two hours of work on the rooms and her efforts show."
5,Ordered the Angie's List Big Deal for $79. Emailed company. Kim emailed and called within 48 hours to set appt. Kim came on time. Cleaned as indicated. Very polite and professional.
1,"After a week, I still hadn't received an estimate so I called and left a message informing him that I had not received an estimate. I again gave my phone number and email address thinking maybe he lost it. After not hearing anything after my call for another 3 days, I left another message asking for the estimate.

4,"It went fairly well, however, it cost me more money. One of the helper's was not as professional, I would use them again but request a different person to help."
4,"This was an Angie's List deal and scheduling with this provider was difficult. When the person would call and leave a message for me to call her to schedule, I would quickly return her call, and had to call and leave a message more than once just to get someone to call. To be honest, after all the attempts I can't remember the exact date when I was finally able to get the work done. When the two y...

4,"I think it was $99 for four hours. They did good work but I had to figure out a way to get it painted. They did good work but they did not finish it. I don't have a ladder tall enough so I think although they were actually doing work, it kind of caused me to do more work. I would have been nice if they had offered a solution to have it finished. They were there longer than the deal was for, which ...

Based upon t...

5,The job was done professionally in a timely manner and they were happy to work around scheduling constraints. Mark communicated with me throughout the job with updates and timelines and they were able to finish this large job quickly. I would definitely hire them again.
1,I tried reaching the contractor four time. He never returned any of my calls. I tried over a period of two weeks. Very unprofessional
3,"It was okay. First of all, it said, ""$99 for three hours of work."" However, they don't tell you that they would bring two people out and that it's split. So, basically it was an hour and a half for $99, with two guys and it also includes them going to get the material. So, that took us 45 minutes. So basically, we paid $99 for 45 minutes. It took them, in addition, three hours to complete the proj...

The woman was very pleasant and ...

4,"When the representative called me to set up the service, I realized that I hadn't understood the details of the deal and it was not going to work for us -- timing and the need to purchase our own materials made it not as appealing to us. I received a refund from Angie's List. The House Doctors were courteous and helpful as I realized this wasn't going to work for us at this time."
3,I called them and the problem was not rectified. They said someone would come out and no one did.
5,"Great job!!! The house is old and the front porch needed repairs. Several pieces has rotted, cracked, and broke off. The new wood was cut evenly and placed in sturdy, interlocking pieces. I was amazed that as much of the porch was able to be repaired within the time frame of 3 hours. I will definitely have more work done on the porch. The carpenter was professional, polite, and did a great job. Th...

5,"The painters came for parts of several days and worked steadily even on some hot days. At the last minute, my husband asked them to do another window and the trim on the corner (which he thought we had requested earlier). They had to come back another day to finish up. The men were very professional and polite and friendly. It is nice to have all of these jobs done."
5,On time (within a set 2 hour window). Did the job. Will need to come back to complete the ceiling repairs though. The mud needed additional time to dry before it was ready to retexture. I will hire again.
3,hired to power wash home. they contact you via email and give you a telephone number to call to make appointment. the number is completely unmanned and getting in contact with them was extremely difficult and when I did they notified me they were booking months out...................
5,"Mark was amazing. He was so conscientious and professional I thought for sure he was the owner (he is not). When the job was completed quickly he offered to paint the area he repaired!! So grateful, otherwise I am sure the wall would not have been painted for weeks! Scheduling was a ""pain"" but now I know it was so worth it. Kim, the scheduler, was a delight."
5,"They responded to my appointment request promptly, showed up on time and completed the work in an efficient and professional manner. I would hire them again to perform other work at my home."
4,"I bought the 3 hrs of service thru Angie's List, but didn't need 3 hrs of work--just wanted to get the job done ASAP. The contractor was prompt, personable and worked efficiently. I had removed water damaged baseboards, drywall, and wallpaper well away from the repair area, but the repair guy extended the drywall mud onto areas that still had wallpaper--making it difficult for me to sand and prep ...

1,Purchased Certificate online and could not get a hold of company for over four weeks. Called Angieslist and they cancelled the purchase (approximate cost of service: $99.00)
5,They did an excellent job and even did the stucco. I would use them again.
4,"They did a great job of quickly repairing the damage. They put down drop clothes and swept up the area pretty well. I think they did a great job. However, it took the company a week or more to get back with me to schedule an appointment."
5,Mike came this morning and I showed him what work needed to be done. He got right to work and was very skilled. I am very impressed with the work he did. It's not even noticeable that there was a huge hole in my wall! I have used The House Doctors before and will definitely use them again.
5,"Responded on time, and came with an assistant. Appointment delayed a half-hour and kept. Worked hard and completed by afternoon. Repaired and replaced several posts and a number of pickets. Worked hard to keep my materials cost down, and cleaned up well. Highly recommend."
1,"The worker showed up, my wife explained that we wanted the walls in the garage repaired, he said that the cracks would likely return despite his work. That's all fine, but he ignored most of the walls and was not here for anywhere close to three hours. The parts he did were fair at best. This deal was a total waste."
5,"Job was partially completed as Deal was for three hours and tech was at end of day. Very neat, thorough, and informative tech. Waiting for an estimate to complete repairs."
5,"Excellent work timely, cleaned up courteous very professional!"
5,I needed to call as the prior scheduler failed to follow-through. When I explained the situation the new scheduler was very responsive and the technician who performed the work was diligent. I would use them again

Disappointed in the time frame for them to come out, as well as they didn't call for a week once I bought the coupon. I wish they would at least call people back. Otherwise the deck looked good."

5,That's what he did and it was a big deal purchase.
1,They are very difficult to get hold of.
5,"They did a real nice job in our kitchen. Painted, cleaned and it's really nice."
3,"They missed the first appointment by an hour and called to reschedule. When they came, it was two fellows for 1 1/2 hours as opposed to a workman for 3 hours as the Big Deal said. The work I needed done did not require 2 men. The work they did cracked badly by the next day. I was told by the next contractor I hired to repair it, that the 'mud' was put on too thickly. I will NOT call them again."
2,They don't have any openings until July I wanted the service done sooner then that.
5,It turned out well. He did good work and cleaned-up after themselves well. They're very versatile company that offers several different services. I've used them for several different things. They've always done good work.
5,"The jobs went very well. They replaced 4 window sills and a 3 sided bay window sill that had rotted. They also took out the bottom six or more inches of the boards going up the side of the window sill. The first day they only did the bottom of the sills and when I took pictures and asked why the sides where not replaced as discussed during the initial walk through they just hadn't gotten to that p...

3,"The guy was quick, friendly, and did a decent job filling in the holes / cracks. But he left little globs of drywall mud all over my newly refinished wood floors. I really wish he'd have cleaned up better after he was done. Now I have to go around trying to remove those spots without damaging my floors. Pretty bummed out about it."
1,They are very hard to deal with. Not customer friendly!

5,"Arrived 1 hr, 20 min late without calling to notify me. Stated upon arrival that they ""got lost."" But got to work as soon as they arrived and worked hard for entire 3 hours. House looked really good when finished. There was an issue with the coupon to begin with. No one contacted me to schedule the service, as stated, and when I finally called, I was told the coupon had expired, but they ""would al...

5,"Mike did, as always, an excellent job. The House Doctors always do an excellent job. They are dependable and responsive. The quality of their work is always good. If there ever is a problem, they always fix it."
4,We had scheduling issues. I had to have lights put in first before the drywall could be done. I called Angie's List to get a refund.
3,Tried to get the work done and they have contacted me once but nothing came from it. Therefore I?m going with someone else to do the work.
3,"This is the second time I used this service thru Angie's and I'm not sure if it was the same person, but it did cost the same and their washer doesn't reach high enough to get all the way up the side of my house."
4,"Took out approximately 3 foot by 4 foot section of damaged plaster wall down to studs, replaced with drywall. I had to supply the drywall and all supplies. I had to pay Lowe's to deliver the dry wall because it wouldn't fit into my car. This was an unexpected complication and the delivery was an unexpected expense. The worker was pleasant to work with and did a good job. I am satisfied with the re...

2,"I purchased the deal in May of 2014 and attempted to contact the provider intermittently by both e-mail and telephone for the next month or so to no avail (they rarely answered the phone and responded to e-mails mainly by giving me the phone number where I left voice-mails that did not elicit a return call). I became frustrated and also busy with other things. When I attempted to get a refund late...

5,It went very well. Mike did everything we needed done and everything works.
5,All went very well. We have not had any leaks.
5,"He arrived on time called to let me know what time he would be here. Got here and got right to work, worked on door first did a great job even painted the frame once repaired. He then worked on the drawers. Clean up and left after the 3 hours."
4,"It didn’t go as well as I’d have hoped. They left in the middle of the job and came back. It didn’t get done as well as it could’ve been done. I had them do the work in the kitchen, the hallway, and some living room work."
1,"Company response This was a real bad day because we got hung up on another person's job which made us real late for this customer. We are human too and we would like to extend a heartfelt apology to this customer. Sincerely, Bob Vecchio P.S. WE tried to re-schedule for another day but she said no. Company response HAVE TO SAY THIS. THIS REPORT IS A STRAIGHT OUT LIE. THIS CUSTOMER WAS SCHEDULED FOR...

4,They were good. I had them to work in the basement office. One tech showed up to do the work; he showed up on time and worked the whole time. I had to pay extra for a few materials.
5,I was very impressed with the workers technical skills and Efficiency in how he completed the job. We would definitely hire them again.
3,"The workers were nice however, the price was a bit high and the quality work was not what we were expecting."
5,"Had a hiccup with the pressure washer and repair / replace the unit causing a delay. I did not realize that soap was not part of the package. Overall, he did a nice job. I was pleased with the outcome. The service provider was polite and prompt."
5,It turned out really good. They did a nice job. There were two people here doing the work. They arrived on time for the appointment and scheduling was good.
5,"Was generally happy with the patching, the larger area didn't turn out quite as smooth as I was hoping although it was a large area that had been cutout so maybe my expectations were too high. Had I noticed it before they left I'm sure they would have addressed it though."
5,"I received an email within a couple of hours of purchasing the coupon. I was a little taken aback when I called the number that came in the email as it was a generic phone company message with no name or company ID provided, but it was the right number and a couple of days later I got a call to set up the appointment., I think it was 1 days from the day I purchased the coupon until they performed ...

2,"We bought an Angie's list deal for 3 hours of wall repair for $90 with the intent of having the contractor repair some cracks in our plaster, exposed after wallpaper removal. I left three messages for the company, twice with a contact that ""wasn't the right person to talk to"". After two weeks, I finally heard back from the appropriate individual and they could not schedule anything until the middl...

1,"They were horrible, he gave me a quote and did an average job. Then when he gave me the bill it was about $800.00 more than he had quoted."
4,The service was ok. They had very good scheduling and availability.
3,"It was fine though there seemed to be lots of glue involved for a carpentry project. Cabinet has held we'll, though. It took several days for him to call me back."
5,The job was done in two days. I had to purchase all the materials and pay separately. The job was billed hourly but I would have preferred an estimate to stick to the price not knowing how long it would take. It took longer than I thought it would since the installer was not here from 9 to 5.
5,"Mark T. was the repairman/ drywall carpenter that came to my house from House Doctors. Very professional, and easy to work with...He repaired the drywall damage to better than new status, and I am very pleased with the results. I definitely will call House Doctors for future repair and house maintenance! Thank You!"
1,"We kept trying to set up an appointment. We finally set a date and time. He was supposed to arrive at 10am and I had to call him at 1pm and he said “was I supposed to do yours today?” He said he would be right out, but I had to call him back 3-4 times asking him where he was and he said the job he was at was taking longer than expected. 4pm hit and he said we would have to re-schedule, but I said ...

5,It looks great. I would use this provider again in the future.
5,The provider came out this morning and said I should call to get a refund because the kind of work I need done is weather dependent and they recommended doing it in June or July.
5,"Finished product was good, but 99 dollars of plastering does not go very far especially when more mud needs to be purchased from Sherwin Williams and the travel time 1/2 hour from my home is included in the length of the service call. Also, prepping the area and clean up afterwards is part of the time frame."
4,"It was okay. It was a little more expensive than I thought or than they estimated. They were fine. They came in and did an estimate. I guess they didn't figure it out and everything so there's a little more that they had to do. Other than the cost, they were professional."
5,The crafts man arrived on time. I didn't have the drywall so he graciously offers to go to Home Depot to purchase some which I paid for. It was only $20. He worked very efficiently and it only took about two hours. I'm very pleased with The House Doctors and would hire them again.
5,"They did a professional job, unlike what other providers had planned to do. Rather than dig a new hole in a different location they removed the old post stump left from the original post that had snapped off at the ground. They also installed it to the proper depth of about 36"", below the frost-line. It was concreted in and sealed to deter eventual breakdown between post and concrete. These guys w...

Significantly more repairs were needed.

5,It was good. They did a good job. The only thing was they ran out of mud and used ours. They left the lid off the mud so we lost that bucket of mud.
4,path was rough and the company wanted more to complete the work
5,"ng on Angie's List, everything went according to plan. An appointment was made, and although we were not present at the time of service, it was performed as promised. I am blind and therefore cannot personally rate the quality of the job, but my wife said that it was fine.After some initial confusion, since the house I wanted to be washed was not the address I was usi"
5,"House Doctors pressure-washing made the back yard patio come alive again! Job included doing the landing step that surrounded the glassed/screened in porch and the shady sidewalk that lead to the front yard?on all sides, the view is pristine now. Great job, would use again."
5,"It went well. Installer went with me to buy the materials I wanted, then come home and installed it all."
5,"Work was done, pleased with service. Big deal was somewhat limited in what they could do. Overall pleased."
4,The provider called within 48 hours to schedule the appointment. They showed up on time and worked diligently for 3 hours to pressure wash my patio and driveway. The whole process went smoothly and I was very pleased.
4,The gentleman got everything done that I needed to so he did a good job. I thought they were a tiny bit overpriced but he did a good job overall.
5,The House Doctors showed up as scheduled and did a great job cleaning the siding on our house. I wasn't home at the time they showed up but they did everything as expected.
3,Did not come on time Had to buy supplies .took lunch on my time did not complete job..Ran out of nails
2,Extremely slow response and had to get the job done. It took almost a month to get a call back in the meantime I had to hire someone else.
5,"Excellent service. Timely, professional. Repair work was very well done."
1,"It looks worse than when we started. They didn't make plans to come and fix it. It was awful. We purchased the coupon in May. They've been unresponsive. They schedule dates that we don't agree with. They came out when they feel like it and not when we've made appointments for it. We've had different information when we talked to the company. With what they quoted us the other day, it was outrageou...

3,"Representative said he couldn't do the work and that they would typically perform very basic tasks such as baseboards, door molding, small jobs in general. However, I need someone to install my finished cabinets."
5,It went really well. We went to Home Depot to pick out the supplies. He was extremely knowledgeable and professional. His craftsmanship was impeccable. He was also respectful when speaking to me and when he entered the house. I am very pleased and will use him in the near future. Ms. K
5,"Very clean, nice repair, done quickly, Everything cleaned up after the job, This plumbing project will now make it very easy to turn the faucet off, outside, for winter weather. The plumber came into the house, did the job, cleaned up, and left the house within 1/2 hour."
3,"Did not go well. House Doctors were to contact me by Oct. 21 and I called them many times and eventually someone called me back the first week of November. They were unable to schedule me until December and gave me many reasons why their staff were out sick etc. Bottom line, they could not perform the work."
3,The gentleman from The House Doctors said that he couldn't do the job that I needed done. He was polite. I felt like he gave up and didn't try.
1,"In the end, I was never able to have services completed and their lack of professionalism concerned me that the quality of their work might be similar. Had several large projects that needed to be completed and the provided clearly was unable to get organized. I wasnt going to provide a negative review since I personally was not negatively impacted (other than wasting some of my time), but they ha...

4,"Once the team finally arrived, their work quality and professionalism were impeccable. Unfortunately, we waited weeks for the origina job to be done and no one has responded to our request for a bid on our kitchen. A shame...these are great people with major prioritization and scheduling issues."
5,Was very punctual. Moved patio furniture off of the deck for me. Only complaint is that the pressure washing unevenly blew off too much of the stain on outer deck so it was uneven when I re-stained it.
5,"The crews shifted around depending on what work was needed on a particular day, but they were all very professional, kept the noise to a minimum and cleaned up after themselves."
5,"Considering the mess that the original installer left, it went well. I was consulted about a few things as far as if I would be satisfied with the proposed ""fix."" Mark, who did the work, was very pleasant, courteous and understanding."
3,"I paid Angie's list over 3 weeks ago but then The House Doctors could only schedule a drywall repair session in December, so, of course, that's waaaay too late and I paid for nothin. I hope they will reimburse us :/"
2,"Contractor seemed much more concerned with getting payment than actually completing the work. Several of the items on the job were not done correctly and the contractor had to return to correct and or complete job. Which he did. Also the cost for materials was considerably higher than expected. The Contractor could not provide invoices for the materials specific to my job to prove out costs. He ju...

5,"They came as scheduled, discussed the options and put the drywall. The work is top notch and the staff is very professional and courteous."
4,"The porch and driveway look nice but, he left standing water on the little deck. It dried partly with a dingy finish. I have to wash it and sweep the standing water away for it to look a bit better. All in all, he did a good job."
3,"We were told two workers would show up but three showed up. Things started out very good in that they covered many surfaces. The work included repairing the ceiling by matching the ceiling texture. The repair did not match at all. The painter did not paint all the way to the edge which left a discoloration all around the room. We called the owner, left a message that the job was not completed to o...

5,Michael Rosipko did a great job and was very professional.
5,One man arrived at my house with his gasoline power wash machine. He asked if he could connect to my outdoor water spigot. I told him to do what he needed to do and he went right to work. At about an hour and a half later he was finished. He walked the perimeter of the house with me and explained what he found during the cleaning process. I was very happy with this service.
3,"I purchased a big deal for this service. I was kind of disappointed with that. They said they were going to plaster and I had a big hole in the ceiling. And they said they couldn't do that. So they plastered a few places, but they weren't too tidy. We had a hole in the kitchen for the light and they patched that but they didn't put the fixture that covers that hole back. I thought they should have...

5,They did great. He fixed the door frame that I needed and he was out. I had some other things that I wanted done but it was not covered in the Big Deal and that was okay. He didn't charge me for the materials either. What he did was great.
3,"I signed up for the offer but when the schedule came up to schedule service, I discovered they are only available M - F 8 - 5. Unfortunately I have to be at work during those times."
1,My husband called on 9/25/14 to inquire about replacing some doors & received their voice mail. He left a message & we still have not received a call back.

5,"I was on a cancellation list, and low and behold, I was called and the plaster repair tech was able to get the work done before the holidays. The 99 dollars for three hours of repair did not go very far, due to prep times and the necessity for more product from Sherwin Williams which is 1/2 hour drive from my home which was included in the length of the service call. The job itself was done well, ...

5,I had to cancel. I was called back a few days later to reschedule. We picked another day. I then decided not to do the pressure washing at this time.
3,Never was able to set up appointment.

1,"Two weeks later...no bid, no contact. My wife gave a long list of work. I guess they are too busy. We try to support small business, but it is frustrating when they blow you off. Two weeks lost."
5,"They were very nice when we corresponded via phone and email, but they can't do the service quickly enough. Therefore, we won't be able to use them to complete this job."
4,"They did a good job. He was done with the job in an hour and a half. The quality of service was good, it was excellent. I wasn't there. He left when there was half hour left for the 2 hours. I don't think there were any additional charges other than the 77."
3,They sent a message stating they would call and it was open ended have not heard from them.
1,"I first made contact with the house doctor to get an estimate on 7/23/2014. I must have had 30 contacts with this company via the email, and a number phone contact via voice mail.

They were willing to work with me to get the work done so I didn't have to take more time off work. They made up for communication issues by giving me a price reduction! They did a great job and cleaned up before they left! They we...

We live near Lake Erie and house attracts a lot of bugs, birds, and spiders because of location. We could not have done this, ourselves and it saved a lot of work. Price makes this an excellent value. Don't pass this up!"
5,Best job ever. Highly recommend. I have found him to be incredibly conscientious and outstanding in saying that he will do what is necessary and do it excellently. I will definitely keep him in my priority file for a job well done and above and beyond the call of duty. He kept me informed and even texted me pictures of the work done. I couldn't have asked for a better company. A+++ Dr. JLJ

2,This didn’t turn out well. They didn’t put any soap in and just used plain water. The deck didn’t get finished as they didn’t wash the railings. The person who came out looked sloppy and gave the appearance of not knowing what he was doing; he was not professional. We needed to have the work redone by a different company. When I spoke with the manager about insurance licensing he was rude.

5,Everything went well. The work was done as requested and completed much to our satisfaction.
5,"There were no troubles with scheduling and no additional costs beyond the price of the deal. However, they did arrive a couple hours late to the appointment. They washed the stone on the front of the house, the back porch, and a portion of the driveway. Everything turned out fine."
5,There were no troubles with scheduling and they were punctual to the appointment. There were no additional costs and the service was good.
5,"Excellent experience. The workman was friendly, professional and efficient. Did exactly what I needed done and in a short amount of time."
2,"I very much liked the person who came out. Courteous, professional etc. He said he would call me (gave a time estimate). But he never called back!!! No work was performed."
1,"The service was horrible! The provider does not use any solution to clean and so there is really nothing he is doing other than wasting your water. I actually asked him to stop washing the sidings mid way since I didn't want him to waste more of his time and my water. I asked the gentleman who was cleaning if he can come back with the proper cleaning solutions but he said that his employer does no...

On Wednesday I called and left a voice mail that I was wondering if a quote was available. As of today I have not received any response. Certainly does not want me to use them. Very odd and not very professional."

5,the job is a nicely finished job.
1,Terribly. I bought the big deal and they never called even after you folks contacted them on my behalf. This is unfortunate because they appear to be a very good firm and I was looking forward to working with them.
5,"The provider honored the contract, even coming back on two different dates to complete the job. The dry wall had to ""dry"" and the area on which the work was done had to be touched up with matching wall paint. Getting the right color paint took me a couple of trips to Home Depot before I finally contacted the provider to let him know I was ready for the touch up. The job looks very good."
5,"The provider was prompt in contacting me. However, the company was not able to come out and do the work until later the following week. I was able to find another provider to do the work sooner."
3,"We purchased an Angie's List deal with the House Doctors that was $99 for 3 hours worth of plaster repair, which ended up being two workers for an hour and a half.

This was my only issue with them. They arrived on time, all fees were explained and they did a very professional job. They also cleaned up well before leaving. I would definitely recommend them if you have drywall work ...

2,"I already wrote an extensive review regarding the difficulty of contacting the service provider, but the review wasn't posted. I understand why the difficulty occurred but I'm not going to write another review that probably won't be posted."
2,"It didn’t go too well. I was unable to get ahold of him before I purchased the Deal. We wanted him to replace the wood ladder that goes up to the attic with an aluminum ladder. When he finally came, he told us that he couldn’t perform the service we wanted, so he patched two small holes in the wall. That went well. It took him about an hour and then he left."
5,MARK did a fantastic job. Got so much accomplished in 2 hours! Would highly recommend
2,Nowhere on the coupon did it say they don't give estimates. I can't imagine someone coming to do a job without knowing what they are going to do or what to bring in advance. More than likely the job would not be completed in 3 hrs which mean I will have this eye sore in my living room ceiling until they can arrange to come back and finish.
3,The soonest they can come out is August 8th.
5,"It went well. It looks so much better. They offered to come back to paint the ceiling but I had other work pending. They were friendly. They cleaned up after themselves. They were helpful, they explained what they were doing."
5,"It took a while to get an appointment because of the $99 deal on Angie's List...I guess they were pretty busy. Once I got the appointment though, everything went well. Mark was very professional, listened to me, gave me options, and left the room completely clean even after three hours of drywall repair. He pretty much performed a miracle!

5,"It was fine. The electricians were professional, fast, and very congenial. All the repairs were done quickly and done well."
4,"Mike did a very good job and completed all the tasks I had for him in a very professional manner. Very pleasant to work with also. I was not sure if I would use this company again because I had such a hard time getting an appointment set up because Mr. Vecchio said that they were very busy. It took about 2 months from the initial contact to finally getting the work done. I would hope in case of an...

5,"The service was quick, fast and easy. Everything is working very well. Thanks!"
1,"I first contacted them for an estimate June21st they cancelled and said they would reschedule but never got back to me, so I saw a Big deal and thought maybe try again, but got no response, I called left message twice and no return calls, this is no way to run a business, I've used them before and had no problem, but I am done with their service."
2,"They sent out 1 person and he came out on time, but we were expecting at least a 2 man crew. When I first spoke to Mr. Vecchio, I told him to come out and give me an estimate first, but he said they would be ready to start the work when they got there. The worker who came out showed up empty-handed, without any supplies. My wife had to take off work and was very displeased about that she missed wo...

5,The doors look great and Mike did exactly what I was looking for.
5,"The contractor arrived on time, explained how he would do the job, and then completed the work. The plastering work in the family room matched the design of the rest of the ceiling beautifully. I would use this company again."
3,"I purchased the deal and emailed House Doctors with several dates in Feb. Did not hear back and ended up using someone else. In April or May I received a phone from Mark Thompson who works for House Doctors. He apologized for the late contact but House Doctors had been booked up. (Probably due to Angie's Big Deal). He was very nice and I probably would use them in the future on a more flexible pro...

1,"I have used them before and was very pleased with them. They returned my call in a matter of minutes and were here within two {2} hours. This time I called Monday 6/23/14 and got a recording saying the would get back to me soon. I didn't get a return call on Monday 6/23 or Tuesday 6/24. I called them again on Wednesday 6/25 and got the voicemail again. I left my name an phone number. It is now Sat...

5,I've used House Doctors in the past and will use them in the future should I need any handy man services. They are responsive and reliable.
5,"The guy who worked on the house did an excellent job. It was not small accomplishment to get off the numerous coats of paint over the years and get the windows to look so excellent. He was polite, kind, conscientious and thorough. We walked through the project at the beginning and near the end. He cleaned up after himself and cleaned up more area than he had to. It was an exceptional job."
3,The service was good. It went as planned but I was a little disappointed as I felt it was incomplete. I felt they were using the Big Deal to try and get me to purchase more services. I ended up completing the job myself. The guys were nice to work with but it was not a complete job.
4,Not like I expected. Miscommunication. Not enough knowledge about lathe and plaster to make proper repairs
5,Pleasant worker and eager to please.
5,"They responded to me in a timely manner. They put one piece of siding on my garage, installed paneling in my basement and installed a pole in my closet to hang clothing on. They also boarded up my garage window that was missing. I paid extra to purchase plaster and paneling for the work, we went to Home Depot together to pick out the materials. The service worked well. I like them because they are...

1,"It was fine until my appointment day. He said he would be arriving between 8-12 today. At 2:30 he has still no shown up, I called and left him a voice mail. He called back and hour later saying I was second on the list, but I fired him. I could have been out getting things done instead of waiting all day on him to show up when he was supposed to."
4,"It turned out okay. There was a delay in getting them to come out on the side of the service provider. When they did come out, it was just one tech. I was not at home at the time."
4,"He was a very hard worker, and reduced my bill due to a mis-communication regarding his start time. In a confirmation call from his boss, he stated that a worker would be there between 9-9:30am. The worker showed up around 11:15. He stated that he never starts that early and apologized for the mix-up. I did contact Angie's List initially when I was trying to set up the appointment. I was having di...

5,It went well. The worker was on time and was polite and professional. He did a good job. The scheduling was acceptable and they were out within about 3-4 weeks. The cleanup was good.
5,"This was an Angie's List Big Deal. He had to reschedule twice, but once he got here, he did a nice job. He let me know up front how much he thought he could get done within the 3 hours included with the Deal and the rate for additional work. We agreed on the order he would do things and he got to work. The patio looks MUCH better and the siding too. He was careful to move a set of wind chimes I ha...

5,Scheduling was good. The fence looked nice when they were finished.
3,I’ve used them for other projects and the work was OK but again the pricing was way too high.
5,"After purchasing the deal, they were busy and we had to wait for open availability. As soon as they had an opening, they were able to come out right away. They completed the work and cleaned up well. They were no additional fees beyond the cost of the deal. My experience with them turned out very good."
5,They were very good. I am trying to get him to do other work for me. They were polite and professional. They had good ideas on things I was looking at. They cleaned up well after themselves.
1,"Gave supplier 3 dates as requested on original order. Supplier a left voice mail to call. I called multiple times but always got an answering machine. Supplier called back twice but never set a date as I requested multiple times. They don't listen to their messages as I told them to stop playing phone tag and give me a date.

2,"Nobody called. I sent another email WEEKS later and still no reply. Finally I received a call from someone, but I was out of town. I returned the call and there was only voice mail.

1,"I reached out a few times to get some more information, and I never heard back from them. I would not recommend this company."
5,"We were very pleased with the work. They were very professional and worked very well. Rick was very good about explaining things as they went along. If they were going to be late and they were on two occasions they did try to call and let us know. All the work is beautiful, you can't even tell where repairs were made. Great job."
5,"Everything went well, and we were very happy with the service. Scheduling the work was easy, the two-man crew arrived on time, and it did a great job without leaving behind any messes."
1,"I had water damage in basement during the cold. Plumbers came out to fix the problem and these guys came to rebuild basement. They insisted on half money up front. They got a permit and things that they were supposed to do. The quote was rather high, but I wanted it done right. I gave them a little more than half when I received my insurance check. My neighbors noticed they were not putting in the...

They checked in with me through every step as the job clearly was going to take more and resources than what I paid for in the Deal. They completed the job to my satisfaction and they cleaned up after themselves. I would definitely use them ...

5,They do very good work. I wish they would've called before they showed up. The painting job looks great.
5,He was polite and did his work. He completed all areas that were requested. Great Job!
5,"Looked at what needed to be done and told us what they were going to do, which they did. Finished work in timely fashion."
2,"I left a message. He got back to me, and told me he was looking at after June 19. I called him back and left a message with possible dates and he never called me back. I got someone else to do the work."
4,Job went ok. Provider did what I paid for and showed me how to finish the job myself.
3,"I've been calling this contractor off and on for over a month and have never received a return phone call. The number listed goes to a voice mail that only states the telephone number. With such a high rating here on Angie's List, I was expecting more. I'm still hoping to hear from them."
5,Scheduled and showed up right on time. Work performed fine. My concrete and brick are pretty old so I didn't have high expectations. They did the best they could do with what they had to work with. The House Doctors did everything as promised. I'd use them in the future for other projects.
5,He was very professional and personable. We did not have to wait long for an appointment and he showed up on time. He cleaned up after himself and even offered advice on other work items we need done.
5,Very friendly guys and quick service. Helpful and informative. It worked just as it usually does with The House Doctors. I continue to use them because I have such a great experience with them every time.
1,He never bothered to call back.

Mark arrived on t...

3,"Overall, it went ok. They said they couldn’t do two stories, which I wish I would have known. I also had to pay for some additional time to get the job finished, and it seemed like they charged me for an hour to cover a half hour’s work. If I could do it over, I would not purchase this Deal again."
1,"When I tried to get an appointment set up, they told me it would be way far out. The man I spoke with was rude and did not have common people skills and didn't know how to talk with people. He told me to just get a refund."
4,Work was done less than 3 hrs but had to pay additional cost for parts.
4,"Generally the work was OK. The problem is that there was a push to agree to more work and, the the time, we didn't want it done. Within days I contacted them again to do follow-up work and do the next phase of what was started, and I never heard back from them."
1,"I’ve tried contacting them repeatedly, but I haven’t gotten any response."
1,"When I call for my appointment they service provide told me he could not do the work until May 6 which was over 4 weeks away. I really wanted the work done so excepted the day because my Big Deal was going to run out but it was not a very convent day to get it done. I took off work and wait for him to show up. They did not even call me to tell me they were running behind. I had to call twice to fi...

He h...

5,"Took advantage of an Angie's List Big Deal and glad I did. ""Jim"" was the man who did the work and he was very professional, even fixing a couple of things I should have mentioned and didn't. If Jim represents the type of person and quality of work to expect from House Doctors, we will be using them again. Very pleased with everything he did."
5,"The guy who did the work showed up about 30 minutes late but did call to let me know. The owner showed up close the end of the job. I paid an intro discount for 3 hours of drywall work. The work was done very well, however what I thought was a pretty small job (patching an area approx 24""-24"" and skim coating) took 4 1/2 hours so I had to pay an extra $70+. When he initially looked at it he told m...

I paid for it in Feb. and asked if they could hold off till warmer weather for the work, because that's when the pops are worse. Mark came on 4/23 as requested, and this is a challenging area to work on in our house. It's been repaired twice before, but Mark tackled it really well, and it looks ABSOLUTELY WONDERFU...

The clamping mechanism had become loose, and the unit fell down when the vibration of me turning it on made it come totally loose.

They did a good job but it was a big job for three hours. The clean up was fine. It just seemed like it took them a long time, which is what I remember but maybe it was required, I don’t know.

1,"I bought the deal on Thursday 4/10, indicating I wanted the service any time from Tuesday 4/15 thru Thursday 4/17. I got in contact with The House Doctors/Bob Vechio Saturday, 4/12 giving my phone number. Bob Vechhio never called me though I left two voice mails for him on two separate days during the time period I had wanted the service."

Marc came back, redid the dry and painted the ceilin...

4,"I am updating my review below after the provider provided a response. I understand that the owner was going through dental surgery at the time I contacted him. I do wish someone called me after the fact to explain why no one reached out to me, but understand that things happen. Lousy service. I don't understand how providers in the business of providing ""service"" don't actually provide any. I emai...

3,"They came out and really only did about two hours of work. They hung up some mirrors. I needed them to fix some aluminum siding, and the gentleman never even brought out a ladder. He promised to come back to finish the job, then the company never followed up with me. The work that was done was done well, but they did not do the amount of work I was expecting when I purchased the deals."
4,One guy came and completed the job over a course of a couple of days. We did have to do some rescheduling but everything worked out fine. They did a good job with the work.
1,"I purchased a $99 3 hour drywall coupon which was stupid on my part. You cant do much in 3 hours. They basically slathered mud on everything leaving me with a huge project to do. Months later all the mud has cracked and needs to be redone again anyways. The guy talked to me for about 1/2 of the 3 hours. Total waste of money. I really wish I had thought it through as all it did was cause me to miss...

Being a female homeowner and always being fearful of being taken advantage of it is always a comfort to deal with someone who respects you.

3,"They did what we needed them to do, but I would say that it was top quality. Unfortunately they did not protect the sink which is one of those plastic marble type things. So, we got scratches by stuff they dropped in the sink. The plaster was a little bit bumpy. So, they are not a company I would have back. I know that they did not remove all the wall paper.

If we had know he was going to do the sawing...

I finally got in touch with the contractor who said someone would call me back soon. I never heard back. I called a few more times...

1,"The service provider is very hard to get hold of. After several calls without responses, I am tired of waiting."
1,They are very difficult to get a hold of. It is not consumer friendly due to nobody being on the phone. They do not call back in a timely manner. This is very inconvenient.
3,"The provider contacted us quickly, but was unable to schedule the work for nearly two months."
5,"He finished the patch in well under the allotted three hours (including a run to the Home Depot for supplies), so he found a few other cracks on the walls and patched those as well. It took several weeks to schedule the repair, but given the discount, I didn't mind that very much."
1,i WAS UNABLE TO CONTACT HIM. SOMEONE NAMED CARL CALLED ONCE AND DIDN'T LEAVE A MESSAGE. I CALLED BACK IN 5 MINUTES AND THERE WAS NO ANSER. i LEFT SEVERAL MESSAGE. IF HE DIDN' WANT TO HONOR THE COUPON HE SHOULD NOT BE USING THEM.. I WANT A REFUND AND WILL CALL
5,"Scheduling was a little tricky, but once I had an appt, Jim arrived on time and got to work. He worked efficiently and quickly and did a good job. The finishing (counter sinking/puddying the nail holes) could have been better, but overall, I am satisfied with the work."
5,"The House Doctor plumber arrived very quickly to fix the broken handle on my bathroom sink. The broken handle needed to be taken apart, analyzed, and repaired with new parts. The plumber quickly got the correct parts for the repair, he came back very quickly, he repaired the handle, he cleaned up the area and was gone within just a few minutes. All and all this was a very good service experience."

3,They came out to complete the work I asked them to please call me if it was going to go over the 2 hours. I did not hear from them. They ended up trying to bill me for extra time. I did not pay it and I hired someone else to come out and complete the work.
5,Everything went fine and I was very happy he was able to take care of all my needs in those 2 hours. Scheduling was very easy. He was very pleasant in my home and did everything I had asked him to do.
5,Everything turned out just fine and it was all straight forward. One technician was here doing the work and it only took about 2 hours to complete. Scheduling went well and they called me set up an appointment. The results look great.
5,The House Doctor sent Jim who performed all tasks in a professional manner for a good price. Jim was prompt and responsive to all requests. Job well done! Thanks House Doctor. Roger K.
5,"They came out, and it was all done within a couple of days. They came out right on time, and I liked working with them. Mike was very friendly, very talkative at times, he did quality work, he knew exactly what he was doing, and if you asked him a question, because you didn't understand, he would take the time to explain everything to you, and tell you why he was doing it."

The fellow that came out was courteous, was careful about cleanliness and did a nice job patching and texturing the effected area. This was part of an Angie's List Big Deal ($99 for three hours of work). The only odd pa...

5,It worked out well. They contacted me and then they came out as soon as I could schedule a time so they were prompt. They did a fine job and they worked with me to do exactly what I asked to have done. They were easy to work with and they were responsive to the requests I had.
1,"They showed up quickly, took my money, and never did the service. I had to pressure them to send my money back."
5,"They did fine. It was a sort of a Spring cleanup kind of thing because I had stains from the winter mold, but they got it done. They came up and did the work. They did the porch because the driveway is so small and they still had time left. They cleaned up everything and was gone."
1,"I called this company the week I purchased the deal in June of 2013, left a message and never heard back. I figured it was spring and they were probably busy so I would try again later in the summer. Later ended up being August and the same thing happened. I called, had to leave a message, and never heard from them. As of today I am out the $84 that I paid for this deal. Obviously, I do not recomm...

3,"It was okay. That was 18 months ago. I was not necessarily very happy with the results of what they did. They just did seem like they completed the whole job. The price was reasonable, they responded quickly, but other than that, I do not know what else."
2,"It took numerous phone calls and rescheduling multiple times before someone showed up. I asked him to repair a rotten window sill after deciding to replace the sash chords myself. The worker who repaired the window sill was proficient. He was neat, on-time, and polite. The run-around with the father and son team was beyond ridiculous."
3,The service turned out fair. They came back once to try and fix the issue but the windows still leaks. They did try to rectify the situation. They came on time and did what they said they would do. If it wasn’t for the leaking I would have no problem with the service.
5,"The work was fine. I was going to have my son hook up the washer and dryer, but after talking with Jay he had said that he didn't come up with the price but it shouldn't be anything crazy for him to hook it up. He said they would call me to let me know the price. Well they ended up just sending me a bill and it had a an extra $158 charge on their that we had not discussed. I had already called a f...

Trying to reach them was frustrating and I ended up going with someone else to get that work done,"
5,"We had a handful of spots in our home with broken drywall or areas that needed cleanup. They came in, were efficient and made everything look great (improved some of the stuff I did!)."
5,"Went well. he completed all tasks on my list, pleasant personality."
2,"Firstly, I would like to say Robert, who was the employee that did all the work ,was fantastic. I have no complaints with the work he did or him. He was professional, super fast, and did a great job. Bob, the owner, in the beginning, was responsive and offered a great service at a nice price. Hence the ""D"" rating rather than an ""F"" rating. Our original appointment was rescheduled, then the day of ...

5,"The staff from the House Doctors are always great. The problem was fixed quickly and efficiently--a small, metal bottle opener had gotten wedge in the garbage disposal. It now runs perfects and the old bottle opener was trashed."
5,See above -- all went very well and I would use them again.
5,Mike did an amazing job. He came on time and did everything he said he would do. I would recommend him to my friends and family.
1,"Played phone tag for weeks, didn't seem interested in actually scheduling a job or wanting my business. It shouldn't be work for me to give my money away!"
2,"We first contacted the House Doctors in early November after seeing an add in the monthly Angie's list magazine for the House Doctors we made the initial phone call. We were contacted the week prior to Thanksgiving and told that ""they were doing gutters following week."" We were quoted $69 per hour. The Angie's list add stated $100 off for members spending at least $200. The week no one came or cal...

5,I purchased 3 hours of work for $111. The handyman arrived promptly and worked diligently for the entire 3-hour period. He did a good job and cleaned up the area when he was done. it was a big job for one person and he did a very nice job.
5,"House Doctors is one of the best companies we have ever worked with--every business should model themselves after House Doctors. They came within two days of my call to look at the job and give me an estimate; told me they would be out in two weeks to do the work; came exactly when they said they would, then would only accept payment after I confirmed that I had reviewed the finished work and was ...

Lori and her daughter worked really hard to get to all the areas I had requested they clean. They did an especially thorough job on the bathrooms and on my wood floors. They changed bedding in the guest room, folded the pile of clothes in one of my kids bedroom...

I just received a call from John stating that he himself was the one here that claims he cleaned my gutters 2 Tuesdays ago 12/17/2013!

I told him that I was going to need pictures prior and he said that he would have to take down some of the drywall and replace it. I told him that I needed pictures while he was doing it and I needed it done b...

5,We had our plaster ceiling in the kitchen repaired. They repaired the |hole in the ceiling and painted ceiling. I would use this provider again but only if they had another special. The hourly rate of $65.00 per hour is a little dear for me.
4,"Purchased the deal in September. Played phone tag/email tag. Finally was scheduled then worker called in sick. Re-scheduled, quote was higher than expected and I backed out. Missed 2 days of work. They were very understanding in my wanting to cancel. I may do this at a later date, but not now."
5,"Serviceman arrived a few minutes early, was polite, and had materials, supplies, and tools with him. He did have to run to the home improvement store for something, but returned promptly. He worked quietly and efficiently for the three + hours and cleaned the area when finished."
5,They were very nice. Hard to make an appointment because they were very busy. The gentleman who came did a nice job and was very professional.
5,"This was a special - 2 hour $75. They were very responsive setting up the appointment and calling back when I had a question after. The handyman was prompt, clean and friendly. Better yet he was very skilled. He handled all the tasks listed in the two hours and then I had him look at some future projects. I felt I really got my money's worth. The company and the representative were very profession...

2,"There were 4 half-dollar sized holes in my ceiling above my steps. They didn't patch them, they just put tape over them. They did not do the work that was contracted to be done, they were supposed to patch the holes up and prepare them to be painted. With the plumbing, it was a fiasco. I had contracted with them to replace all my pipes, they had to take the ceiling down and didn't replace all the ...

I had some ceiling tiles that had been damaged due to water leaking from a toilet upstairs. He came in and replaced the tile that had been damaged and if I had found the same type of tile the job was done so good that you wouldn't know that it had been repaired. He also replaced the ...

5,My experience went very well. The staff was very professional and friendly while visiting. They are a great company. The pricing was reasonable and I would highly recommend them to others.
5,"The workman had not seen our configuration previously--the gutters were actually glued to the fascia board. It required some maneuvering to fix the dents from the branches that had fallen against them and crinkled them plus damaged the gutter guards. The workman were pleasant and friendly. They did a professional job and made it almost as new. The House Doctors are definitely worth every penny I p...

My problems: my pickup truck lost its brakes one day as I pulled into my driveway and hitting the brakes didn't work. I continued into my garage...

5,"Overall, they are great to work with. There were at times some issues with some of the work. Given the scope of all the work we were doing, this is not surprising. What is important to me, is that they are responsive to feedback and concerns. Not only were they responsive, but the crew really went out of their way to address any issues that come up. We are continuing to work with them, and I would...

5,"could not have been better. I read on line about assemble of the shed. I knew that I could not do this, even with help of a friend. It is perfect. I have used them in the past and will continue to use them in the future. They stay in touch through out the entire process."
5,"See Above, Power washed the house, scraped, caulked, and painted the house and shutters."
4,"It went okay, I had to pay extra money for the second half of the house but they did a good job."
4,"Purchased the deal, try to contact them multiple times. No one answers the phone. Finally got a call and the earliest appointment is one month later. So I had to find someone else to do the work, thus want to cancel this purchase. Thanks."
4,Responded within a week and gave me a fair estimate.
3,"I bought a big deal coupon for the House Doctors. Someone came and did great work. I was happy enough with the service to purchase a second coupon. Unfortunately, after numerous phone calls, the company and I were unable to come to a mutually acceptable date for the second visit. I am averaging my good experience with my less happy experience to get the C grade (really more like a B-)."
2,My experience was dissatisfying. I called late in the season and they came to put the coat. Cracks and damage started to appear and I asked that he come repair the cracks. He said it was too late in the season and would not come back to repair the driveway.
5,"First they checked the roof and thought they had found the problem, so they repaired and painted the garage ceiling and wall, but then it rained and caused a big hole in the ceiling and caused the wall to bubble. They came out and looked at it and contacted a roofing expert, who said that we needed to replace all of the shingles, that it was caving in and would cause more problems if not done."
2,"I spoke with the provider about my job prior to purchasing the big deal and was satisfied with using them. After the purchase of the deal I did not hear from them, I called several times a week to multiple numbers and left messages but did not receive any calls for over a month. The last time I called, I advised that I was very interested in using their services and I was not in a hurry, but just ...

The crew presented themselves in a very professional manner, were very friendly an...

5,"It was fine. I gave them a tip, but I didn't spend anymore than the cost of the Big Deal. They were very nice, they did their job and then left. I would use them again with an Angie's List discount, but their regular price, if I remember, is a bit hefty; so I don't know if I'd use them without one."
1,I am requesting a refund because they would not answer and return my calls.
2,"We called this provider, but they never returned our call."
3,"Both young ladies were delightful but explained to me that the service was a little unorganized since the owning partners spit and the staff was reduced by half. It was apparent that neither girl enjoyed the work but at least one of them attempted to accomplish the task. The younger girl was not at all experienced in the housekeeping field and needed total supervision from her co-worker. Nice girl...

All work was done very neatly, no flaws, and the crews cleaned up all the areas perfectly. All work done very quickly, and professionally. The manager came by the next day to inspect the work and ensure everything was done correctly."
5,He did a good job of painting. Clean up after the job. Was professional.
5,"I am very pleased with the work done by the House Doctors. The workers were always on time. They were polite. They cleaned up everyday when they were done. They kept me informed about what was going on. There was a lot of sanding and scraping to do. I was amazed how well they cleaned up all the dust and paint chips. They did a great job tuck pointing and painting the walls. The epoxy floor looks o...

I initially had a dificult time getting in contact with the House Nurses, and didn't receive a call back after several messages left. However, they had a wrong number for me and once we realized this, the housecleaning ...

3,"I hired these folks to come wash my driveway. Our snowplowing service left some rusty trails on the driveway during the winter and I wanted the spots cleaned off as well as the driveway powerwashed. After purchasing an Angie's List Big Deal from this company several months ago, they were quick to contact me and set up an appointment. They were willing to come sooner, but I asked them to wait until...

5,They called quickly after I purchased my Big Deal to arrange a time to come out. The young man who did the work was efficient and professional. Knew what he was doing and kept at it until the job was done. we had more work to do than could be done in the time allotted by the big deal and he gave a good estimate of how much more money/time it would be.
5,He did the work and he had extra time and asked what else he could do. I would use them again if I got another big deal.
2,"We have an old house. We purchased the faucets and shower and had replacement tiles. Approximately four or five had to be changed for the new faucets. Robert came out to do it all. He was very polite and a hard worker. However, he seemed uncomfortable with the tile work. He was pounding on the tiles with a hammer. After the first trip he needed to order an extension for the faucet due to the thick...

5,"Excellent experience. When the workman were late, they called to let me know. They were friendly, cleaned up after themselves and checked with me as the work progressed. This was another excellent experience with The House Doctors!"
5,"Plumber showed up within an hour of my call, and he repaired a toilet flushing device in our bedroom area. Pieces for this particular toilet are hard to find, but the House Doctor plumber did the whole repair within an hour."
5,"The post was on a porch that had been replaced some time back by the House Doctors. It turned out that the roof of the overhang was empty inside. A new ""panel"" had to be added to the overhang to secure the post."
1,Had to call twice before calls were returned. Finally got a call back and they said they would look at my driveway for a quote on re-sealing and leave estimate in my mailbox. No estimate ever given.
5,I was going to have the light replaced so I could have brighter light... but the electrician said we could just use a different wattage. I have used this company for several years. The tech (Rob) was very prompt and the service was great.

When I asked about these, I was told that was as good as he cou...

5,Very well! Contractor actually beat me home to do the work was about 15-20 minutes ahead of schedule. Was very professional went right to work and completed the worked quickly.

5,Good he did a great job and provided pointers

2,"They ended up showing up a month earlier than scheduled. They ended up sending a guy out who couldn't do the job that was required. He was very courteous and did a good job with the work that he did. However, I hired the company to wash the high points of my house and they never brought the ladders needed to do that. I ended up calling the business to let them know, and I still haven't heard back ...

5,"Responsive to my requests. Went well. Two workers budgeted their time appropriately. Cleaned a stove top hood which required climbing on a ladder, countertop which I couldn't do. Next time I would specify that i wanted stove top cleaned - which would be time consuming. I didn't specifically request it this time, so it wasn't done. They cleaned my floor meticulously without drenching it in water (w...

5,They did a great job. The porch and patio look great. They offer great value.
4,A few places not done even though I called them to their attention. some places not swept that should have been
5,"They did an excellent job, they were very punctual and professional. You name it - it's the whole nine yards with this company. I'd highly recommend them and would use them again for future needs."
5,"They were there when they said they would come and they did the work they said they would perform. I didn't have a lot of interaction with them, but it was a fine job and the price was good."
5,"Matt was on time and did the jobs neatly and quickly. Tho I hadn't mentioned the wooden benches there was a little time left and he fixed them. I will use them again for a number of different projects I have planned. He answered questions I had about those future projects, some big and some small."
5,"I was very happy overall with the work completed in 2 hours and for the money paid. I wouldn't have believed the difference power washing could make to my deck which was obviously much dirtier than I had anticipated. The north facing siding of my home was heavily stained with algae and looks great too though there are a couple of places where some light staining remains. It may be that power washi...

5,"I purchased an Angie's List Big Deal special offer for this service and they did an excellent job. My advice to others is to call them up and get them in. Pricewise, it was a pretty special deal."
5,"I rated them A because of the effort they made. The initial contact was fine and a date was set for the pressure washing (with outside window washing by another company scheduled for 3 days later.which had to be rescheduled as well.) But the pressure washers never showed up. Before the scheduled appointment, there were about 4 phone messages left asking what was to be done. I answered all messages...

4,"I purchased a two-hour handyman coupon on 4/23. I called the company via the phone number on the coupon and left a message on 4/24. I received one phone call back later on 4/24 from Mike with a voice mail asking me to call back. I returned the call to Mike's phone number that same day, made another call to the phone number on the coupon on 4/28, and sent an email on 5/13, but I did not receive a r...

1,"Scheduling: Before I made an initial call, the House Nurses began calling my home and telling my daughter that I had to schedule quickly becasue my offer was going to expire. Once I called and left a message, calls continued to come to my home instead of the cell phone number I left. Since I work during the day, I did not get the messages until after close of business. I got to the point of leavin...

4,"The work was fine, he did a good job. He was very quick to respond."
5,The faucet was 13 years old and I just could not turn it off. I called Mr.Vechio and he sent the plumber out the next day (that was the first I was going to be available). All went very well.
3,"On the surface everything looked fine. Upon further inspection, I realized that bathroom rugs were moped around, the shower floor and walls were not clean, the ceiling fans were not dusted, and there is a wall of mirrors that wasn't cleaned at all. I assumed that since cleaning was the job that i didn't have to follow the workers around to make that the job was done properly. Additionally, I was o...

5,"They did a good job. I figure that coming for the very first time, you might want to go above and beyond to wow the customer. They didn’t do this, but did exactly what they said they would, which is fair."
1,I believe the House Doctor is getting too busy and doesn't have the man power to service all the Big deals he is offering. I am hoping that some day he will return my call after four failed attempts
4,Overall it went pretty good. Had to end up paying over the deal I knew it would be over however. I wasn't too happy with the amount of time that it took but they did a decent job. The gentleman Mike Rosipko is a great guy.
5,"We called the House Doctors on Monday, May 13. Bob called back to discuss the problem. That evening his son called to make an appointment. He said they would be near our house the next day, so Jim came in the morning and made the repair. He was very polite and professional."
5,"Although I didn't use them because of timing on my part, they were very attentive to my needs and will use them in the future."
1,"The House Doctors sent their employee on 4/24/13 to pressure wash the front walkway and driveway. The surfaces were washed while it was raining, which made it very difficult to view the quality of thier work. Upon inspecting the job a few days later, I noticed that they blasted away the top finish of my concrete driveway and front walkway leaving the aggregate surface below. I called Mike Vecchio ...

5,This was an overall good experience and we would use House Doctors again for this service.
4,"Purchased deal for 2 hours of pressure washing. Due to volume of business for this deal, vendor informed me that they would not be able to schedule service for 12 weeks. Requested and received refund. Vendor was understanding of this problem."
3,I purchased their spring cleaning deal from Angie's list. They arrived on time and overall did a good job with one big exception. When they cleaned the kitchen I specifically asked that the oven be cleaned only to find that after they left and I went to use the oven they had only whipped down the outside. This has left me a bit disappointed in the service.
5,The work was fine. They did what they were supposed to. They were pleasant to work with!
5,"It was an Angie's List Big Deal that I purchased. I ended up spending an extra $30 because they had to stay a little bit over. They were fine. It was a really hard job and it was tougher than it appeared at first. He had to take extra cuts and measurements on the door hinges in order to get it to work. The only thing I didn't like was that it took longer than I anticipated but that was not their f...

He knocked out my wall saw all the water, climb down and started to tell me that all of the problem was caused by something in my home. Now they leave and tell me they couldn't do anything until I get in touch with the association of my condo. I did and...

He did exactly what I asked for, and I was very pleased with the work and the level of professionalism. I would use them again and I would recommend them as well."
5,Appointment set up was easy. Showed upon time. Completed work. Did not have to be home.
5,I was well pleased with the work he did. He worked so quickly that I had to find other work to do to make up the 2 hours that I had pruchased.
5,t couldn't have gone better and I certainly do recommend them.
5,Went very well couldn't have asked for mort I wil definitely use them again
5,"Overall, the job went well. I plan to call on them again for other jobs, thankfully I don't need anymore doors hung!"
5,"I love them because they do a great job. If they see something that needs to be done, they let you know. I've been having bird issues and fixing the roof is part of the solution they proposed. Bob (the owner) really listens to his customers."
3,"This coupon was a waste of money. Angie's List did me no services this time around. Unfortunately, I purchased the coupon in March and it is now almost May and I am still waiting for my two hours of powerwashing. First, they took almost a week to just call me back after I contacted them with my coupon code. When they did call, they did not ask me what would be a good time and date; they just told ...

After he filled the cracks, he smoothed the drywall so well that the repair wasn't apparent. Then he found the paint that matched each room and touched...

She told me that she would be out between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. I called her at about 11:48 because they never called me to tell me they were going to be late or anything. She told me that she had a family medical issue going on with her daughter. I thought it was potentially unprofessional of her to sche...

5,House Doctors did a very good job. Since it did not take the full time to do the house they also did my detached garage. The house looks much better.
5,"The total experience was amazing! I hope that I will be able to secure a place on The House Nurses schedule for bi-weekly maintenance cleaning. I would also like to mention The House Nurses' superior customer service. First of all, The House Nurses initiated contact the day after I purchased the ""Big Deal"". All communication was extremely polite and professional. My personal preference was conside...

1,We called this provider several times! We were given a quote over the phone for $5500.00 to get our two bathrooms remodeled. We asked to have the quote in paper. It has been 2-3 weeks since that phone call with no quote in writing or follow up. We are tired of waiting on this provider and seeking to take our business elsewhere.
5,"We purchased an Angie's List deal for two hours of handyman work and were very pleased. We had two overhead light fixtures in the kitchen that needed to be replaced. The ceiling was very tall and the lights had not been installed correctly from the beginning so it made things a little more complicated. We also wanted them to install a new fan in the bedroom. Nothing was easy with the kitchen light...

1,Never returned after two visits to give estimate for siding and door threshold repair.

Mike R. was extremely courteous and went above and beyond to explain the best way to remove the mirror tiles and improve the overall appearance of the wall.

Two very nice women arrived punctually with their own cleaning supplies. They needed no direction and were in my home (less than 2000 sq ft) for 3 hours each (total 6 hours). They did the basics -- dusting, vacuuming, scrubbed floors, cleaned 1-1/2 bathrooms. Although they ...

5,The House Doctors responded quickly and came in the evening to accommodate our schedules. It was another excellent experience. The electrician was friendly and professional. The work was completed quickly and he cleaned up after himself. You cannot go wrong with The House Doctors.

When Jim came out that next day, he got right to work, did a great job on...

They stayed on the job, ate on the job and all clean up was good. This work was done on Dad's house approx. 03/23/2010. House has been sold and I don't remember all the specifics. For the work they did for us I would use them again."
5,"It went well overall. Very good service, nice to work with. I would highly recommend Lori and her daughter, Heather."
5,"Cannot sing their praises enough...VERY RESPONSIVE, Arrived right on schedule, extremely professional in every single way!

Use this provider, I highly recommend!"

His work was great -- you'd never know it had been done, which as he pointed out to us, is exactly what you want."
1,"Never got past phone calls. I left a detailed message with my phone number. Did not hear anything for 3 days. I called them and some guy answered the phone with just a hello - never identified the company or himself.

5,"Had a bit of a slow start with a delay in coming to view the job, but once that was done everything went well. The workman was very polite, neat and I really appreciated that he did not make/receive cell phone calls while he was here. He focused on the job at hand and was finished in about three hours."
5,He arrived on time if not early and was very professional and completed all work that we talked about.
4,"Very prompt; met with tenants; completed an estimated and the required work. Tenants were very pleased with work and interactions with the worker. Sent bill upon completion of work, would use again."
5,"Called for arrangements, came promptly, friendly, tidy. Checked daily on work being done."
4,"They were just good, but not excellent. I had difficulty scheduling with them as well."
5,He figured out what contributed to the collapse of the shelves and suggested what to do in order to avoid the problem in the future. He communicated clearly and completely what had to be done to make the repairs. I have already referred House Doctors to a neighbor.

5,My job is too big for this Big Deal and therefore I am getting a refund.
5,Excellent. Mark was on time and courteous. He was able to repair multiple drywall problems throughout the house. He did it in the three hours that was quoted and for the price that was quoted. Everything looks fantastic!
1,"I never used the service, but instead I requested a refund for the Deal. The company was not responsive at all to multiple phone calls or emails. I found a different company that wanted to do the work."
5,"Everything went much more quickly that I had expected, but with high quality. The solution to the bay window sill problem was so simple and elegant that I'm surprised that no one had thought of it before (and others have tried)."
5,"I highly recommend the House Doctors. They are friendly and personable, and they do good work. At times I have asked for a repair and they were honest in telling me that something needs to be done differently, or the repair might not last. Their gutter work and interior leak repair was top notch. Bob and the House Doctors are good people and I never hesitate to call them."
2,"I was hesitant about calling this company because the reviews on Angies List were either A's for workmanship or F's for responsiveness. But I saw that they did a lot of different things and I was searching for one company that I would be able to call as I began my remodel and repairs. I called this company on Tuesday at 9am and left a message on his voice mail. I heard nothing from them. I called ...

They were very courteous and very polite. i would highly recommend them.

5,My experience with the House Doctors has been great. They have done a beautiful job with the work and they are all very courteous and professional. I appreciated how they worked with me to see what the problem was. We found out that there were birds that had gotten into my house. The owner figured the bird was nesting inside and he was right on the money. I would highly recommend them.
5,The day went as planned. They arrived on time and evaluated the job. The new door was slightly larger than the old one and the casings needed to be replaced. They did a nice job.

1,"I telephoned Bob Vecchio and requested a quote to repair my chimney and repair and paint my screened porch. One week after my call I received a telephone quote for the chimney. I reminded them of the porch request and was led to believe I would be contacted. Two weeks later I received another telephone call and quote for the chimney and porch. I was surprised to receive the call and asked how it w...

5,"They did a beautiful job and when they finished it looked like a completely different room. They were very good about cleaning up after themselves and putting everything back where it belongs. Overall I was very pleased with their service. I love their work and hire these technicians all the time. I plan to continue to use again in the future. I also wanted to mention that I had the House Doctors ...

5,Extremely prompt and reliable. Quality work!! Have used The House Doctors before; they are the best!
5,"House Doctors were prompt and courteous the work was flawless.efficient and effective, they kept their word and were reasonabilly price."
3,They didn't know what they were doing. I wasn't particularly happy with the work that was done. The guy who came didn't even bring with him a saw.
5,Always an excellent experience. They are responsive from the first phone call to the finished job. I have used them often for work and would continue to use them.
5,"First - I cant recall exactly what the bill was, but it was very reasonable. I had a number of things to discuss with Bob at the House Doctors and helped me out with everything. I was having problems with my washing machine, and Bob walked me through some steps on the phone that resolved my problem. So that was a relief! Next, I worked with Rod who came out and replaced a dimmer switch then exteri...

5,"Job went well; quickly and promptly. As always, this company is very timely and professional. Thank You!"
5,Everything went well. No actual work was necessary. See above for details.
1,I have not story to tell nothing was done
5,"I contracted with Mike Vecchio to do a large amount of insurance work to restore my basement after a sewer backup. It was a little difficult to get in contact with him at first due to conflicting schedules, but he was very responsive once the work began. He was very willing to work with us on price and options. The workers were very professional and we're very pleased with the results."
5,"Bob responded very quickly to my call. Someone came out so they could see what I wanted. Bob then called and quoted a price and sent a guy out within a few days since I wanted to get the work done before my son's wedding. The guy who came to install the tile was very good - reviewing the design with me and making suggestions. He cleaned up every day before he left and even dealt with my dogs being...

5,"The men that came to my house were really very nice, and the work they did was very good."
5,"We needed (and still need) the brick portions of the two buildings in our condominium association. After House Doctors did such a great job replacing our gutters last year, we decided to use them again to do our brickwork. Bob was very cooperative with our homeowners association in dividing the job up into smaller portions to keep us within our budget. All our members where impressed with the job ...

5,I found House Doctors on Angie's List after several other contractors who provided quotes stopped returning my calls. I was not disappointed. Communication with Bob V. is excellent. I called him on the weekend with a minor concern and he quickly called back and answered my questions. No complaints from any other members of my homeowner association.
5,"Excellent. I emailed and within a week the job was done, before the holiday weekend. The House Doctors are very responsive and their price is excellent."
1,Read the information from above. No service performed!
5,It was a big job. It took them two full days. They were on the ball and they plugged up spots that I didn't even see. They put a screen around our chimney as well which has been helpful. They have done a great job.
1,"The work was so bad, I just wanted to get it over and done with. The company took forever to get back to me and set up an appointment. In the end, they must have sent the least experienced employee to do the work. He was obviously a novice, as the first time he showed up, he forgot his circular saw. Not a good sign. He was nice enough, but in over his head on a simple project. I ended up re-doing ...

Bob gave me an estimate and called me back immediately to let me know that he had to increase it because of the type of fencing we needed. They were very good when doing the work - grading the area and putting rocks around the edges so my dogs wouldn't be tempted to dig und...

5,"I called House Doctors at 5:00 PM when I saw the problem , and the work was done the next day at 10:00 AM. The worker was polite, and very efficient. The end result was very good."
5,"From our first experience with the owner, to the timely and professional experience with the guys that worked morning, noon and night to get the job done, we are extremely pleased with their diligent, clean, and prompt work!"
5,"As always, it went very well. The House Doctors came as promised and we are very satisfied with the work performed."
5,"He reported to have fixed the leak that was dripping on our floor. There is no longer the leak that is visible. However, the source of the leak is still there. We can take showers without leaking, but cannot take baths without leaking. So, the leak has to be in the overflow of the tub. If there?s any overflow of the water, it comes out dripping near the light fixture. It has cost us several thousa...

5,We use them regularly. They are very good. They are very pleasant and punctual. They clean my house well.
5,"No job is too big or too small. All the guys are very nice, even when I change my mind about the details of a job. I appreciate your friendliness and their competence. The work is excellent; they are punctual, do exactly what I want, and work with me to get the job done. It was an excellent experience."
5,"House Doctors gave me a timely estimate, and booked a day a month off to provide service. When the team came, they were extremely professional and friendly, and discussed all the possibilities of how to do the work I needed. They got it all done in a day, did the work great and then cleaned up after themselves. I would and will work with them anytime, and felt I got a great value for the service."
5,Returned calls right away Very Professional
5,They were good and efficient. The price was excellent and I didn't have any problems with them.
5,I simply called them and told them the problem. They came a few days later and it was done. I did not have to take time off from work to be home. They are always polite and professional.
2,See services performed.
5,They do an excellent job. If I have anything going on with the house I call them.
5,My experience was a very good one. I'll be calling Bob again in the future as the need arises.
2,"Evidently, I'm not the only Angies List member to have problems getting a quote from Bob and the House Doctors. Bob; at some point, you need to quite making excuses, fix YOUR company problems (own them) and finally....just take responsibility for the mistakes you're making. Excuses are exactly that, excuses!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"When I first called Mike, he was in the middle of another project. When I told him we needed to list the property for sale, he accommodated our schedule. The work crews finished in a timely fashion, working around a few days I couldn't be home to open the house.They even came back for a minor follow-up request. What more can you ask?"
5,"They were prompt, polite, and my tenants were happy with their service. Their charges were fair, were exactly what I was expecting, and were quite a bit less than what a plumber had quoted me. Mostly, this is the second time I have used them and I appreciate the fact that they show up on time and do what they promised."
2,People are nice in the first contact but they were not organized to do a simple job.
5,"It was a lot of work. The workman came when scheduled. No problems. They made any adjustments that I asked for, and were polite and nice to work with. I have worked with this company before and this was one of the big projects and they did a great job. The cost for the amount of work was very reasonable. I love how the basement look. It is like having a separate apartment. I love the laundry area ...

The replacing of tiles and the regrouting of the tiles around the tub - well - suffice it to say - I wouldn't use the company for anything else - as a result of this poor job. I also would not recommend the compan...

1,"I called this cleaning company twice for an estimate, after reading the reviews on Angie's List, for bi-weekly cleaning. They never called back to set up an appointent for an estimate. I was very disappointed by ther customer service/responsiveness. The other service, also found on Angie's List, I called responded later that day. They will be coming out to give me an estimate."
5,They were excellent in the service they provided.
5,"We are so happy with the work House Doctors did on the baseboards and gutters - it gives the house a whole new look!! They did a fabulous job on the tile repair, as well. We had a few tiles break during the installation of the baseboards, but they were extremely prompt in returning to fix them once we brought it to their attention. Bob, Mike and the workers were all very, very pleasant to work wit...

After contacting the manufacturer, and receiving a brand new faucet like the one I had, he came back and quickly installed the new faucet. He was fast, efficient and knew exactly what he was doing. I was expecting a large bill, since he made 2 trips to my house, but was only charged for the final install. I also have to giv...

Not only did they do what I expected; they did so much more and they did it in record time. They were fast , efficient and needed very little direction. It was without a doubt the best house cleaning I have ever encountered. The house looked immaculate and smelled...

5,"I called Bob and asked him to do the work on short notice because the contractor I originally had asked to do the work never showed up. He had his son come out the next day (Thursday) and someone from his firm completed the work on Friday so it would be done before my new tenants moved in on Sunday. They did a good job of securing the bannisters, repaired the drywall, left the key on the counter a...

5,"They were professional, thorough and did good work The individuals were personable, on time, and responsive. While at one juncture we had some concerns, Bob was very responsive and we worked things out quite satisfactorily. We will likely use their talents and services again."
1,"I can't understand why they didn't call back, and why they would leave the first message implying they'd come and then not bother to call back. It was very surprising and unprofessional, if they don't have time to take on customers, all they had to do was say so or at least not leave the first message saying they could come, and then not answer my quick answer back."
5,"Very professional, great service, all work done to estimated budget, no problems. The workers cleaned up and the house looked great when they were done."
5,Everything was excellent. They did a great job. I call them anytime I have a problem. I really enjoy their service.
5,"They were prompt, communicated with me, and I did not have to be there went the work was being done. They cleaned up well and did good follow up."
5,See above. Couldn't have asked for a better outcome.
4,They did good but they were overpriced.I was really displeased that they wanted over $200.00 for the service they did.I would not recommend them.
1,No one ever called me back. I never got a quote from them.
4,"The original call was for gutter cleaning and re-staking the gutter on one side of the house. The first call was answered immediately and I was given an estimate. Weather delayed the service a little but I was happy with the promptness in providing the work. Unfortunately the job was more involved and required replacement of some fo the facia boards, adding in wood to nail the facia to. The person...

5,My laundry tub backed up and over flowed. I call The House Doctors that morning. Bob called me right back and sent the plummer to my home that same day. As usual he did a great job.
5,"Bob answered my call and walked me through the process of forwarding him a picture of the damage on my phone (I had used this function only once before and was pleased to accomplish this task!). His repair person came at the date and time that was convenient for my neighbor, and the problem was solved by removing a piece of existing siding on the back of the house covered by a planter, using that ...

5,"I feel that it went very well. When I did have an issue, there was no trouble in getting a technician back out to fix the problem."
5,"They were very nice and thorough, we were very pleased with them. When speaking with him on the phone afterwards he asked if I needed anything else, and I mentioned I needed a plumber. He said he would have a plumber at my house within two hours and he did!"
5,"These guys are great! They keep me informed, are friendly and do a great job. They check with me if a decision has to be made and consistently leave me feeling good about both their work and my dealing with them."
5,"From minor problem to major repair, these are the guys to hire. No job is too small and they are always responsive, responsible and courteous."
5,"It went great. The day we called the owner Bob sent Jay out to look the door and diagnose the problem. Jay diagnosed the problem and made sure we could get the door closed. Subsequently it was determined that the company that made our door was no longer in business. House doctors told us they would look for the parts and we also requested a quote on a new door. Approximately 7 days later we receiv...

Rod showed up on time and I showed him the work I wanted done. I found it odd...

3,"I searched them through Angie’s List. I liked that they called me back promptly. I liked that they were willing to work with me in terms of price. They did not finish the work to my satisfaction now. They told me they were going to come back and sand it on top of the railing and wood filler in, they never called me back or finished the job. To try to get hold of them would be on my list of to dos....

I unfortunately did not write down the carpenter's name, but he was right on time, was very pro...

3,"I wasn't home when they came. If I was, I wouldn't have had them just put more screws in the shutters."
5,The work was performed very professionally. They arrived when they said they would and finished quickly.The final cost was much lower than I expected.
5,"He hired his own professional to perform the actual work, but he chose very wisely and the individual was very professional and skillful."
5,"The House Doctors sent carpenter Jim Turo to my house to deal with some loud creaking sounds in the main floor. We spent a fair amount of time trying to locate noises by having me walk the floor while Jim listened from below. It turned out that the worst ones were in hard-to-reach places, but Jim managed to silence the very worst offender with a couple two-by-fours and screws and glue. He made her...

5,"I got them from Angie’s list. They have a variety of crafts people available. So if you need a carpenter or an electrician, they have them. Everyone is very competent. They were nice and kind. They did the job they were supposed to do and did it well. I would use them in the future."
5,It was a Big Deal that I purchased. It was $100 for several hours of work. They were able to complete the work in the allotted time. The price was fine for the work they did. I would use them again.
5,I was given a time estimate of when they would be in the area. Came home one day and noticed the work had been completed. Some debris was left on the ground around the garage but everywhere else was clean. Invoice for services arrived a few days later.
5,I called the House Doctors and was impressed by how quickly my call was returned. Appointment for estimate was made and House Doctor was very punctual; estimate forthcoming.
5,"They were prompt, efficient and reasonably priced. They did a quality job. Note: job was completed last November 2010 and the gutter has held up very well in the past year, espcially since we had a lot of build up of ice and snow last winter. We would highly recommend them."
5,They were quick to call me back and accomodated me to get me on their schedule.
5,They did a good job of doing the repairs. I was still worried that water was pooling around the back of the house and they came back without any problems and added more dirt and filler. I was pleased with the result
5,"They worked within my crazy schedule around the Thanksgiving holiday and family coming and going. They arrived as scheduled, completed the work in less time than I anticipated. I called afterwards about some minor clean up issues -- it was very, very windy when they were doing the rip off and install -- but came back promptly and took care of the clean up and were very, very apologetic. I will def...

His crew called to let me know when they were coming, just as he said they would, and they did the job as ...

5,"They did a quick and thorough job and charged a fair price. I liked that one of the employees rang the doorbell to show me the bucket of muck he had removed, per my request, from a clogged downspout. That gave me confidence that my request had been granted."
5,"Bob responded to my e-mail the next day. He took the time to listen to my needs. One of his employees called me and arranged a time for an inspection. Bob called that night with an estimate. Since I could not find another person willing or able to do the work, I had no way of comparing the price. The work was done very professionally. I was especially pleased that the work was done before the wint...

The foreman followed up the next day to make sure everything was done to my satisfaction. Very good work, quick, clean, and profes...

In their defense we had a record year of rain, it was late in the year, and I'm sure they were trying to get caught up (finished) with projects before the ...

5,"Things went very well from my initial e-mail to follow up calls. Prompt response to my request,scheduled at a time that was convienient for our family. Bob was curtious and accomdiating. I appreciated that he called to confirm that he had the order exactly right."
5,"As always, the work was done professionally and without problems. I am always pleased with The House Doctors' work."
4,"Three men showed up (surprisingly) on the day after Thanksgiving, and only maybe three days after initially calling House Doctors. They were very courteous and professional, quickly getting to work to clean the gutters. They didn't leave a mess, and disposed of the gutter collection themselves. They even suggested ways to improve the gutter on my garage for better flow. A bill arrived in the mail ...

5,"Nice job, arrived on time, did professional work. Months later, it's all good."
5,"I was very afraid to take down the porch, (The house doctors had originally built it about 5 years ago.) The workers were very nice, respectful, humored me as I agonized over the event. They also worked around and in those many days of rain. The waterproofers removed a cement slab under the porch, dug down, discovered broken pipes and a foundation wall full of holes. New pipes were put in,city ins...

5,More recently a young man came to clean my gutters and he did an excellent job too. He cleaned up after himself well and bagged up all of the debris.
5,"My experience was positive. The weather was the biggest hinderance to this portion of my project. The only drawback concerned my upper porch floorboards. The work crew only did roofs, so I will have to look elsewhere to get the floorboards replaced. I did receive some good advice about what to do about the upper porch. In the Spring I probably will need their services again."
5,"We got them from Angie’s List. They were excellent. They had an estimate that was lower than what the job entailed. The job ended up needing a lot more work, but because they were doing the job they were doing it very very well. I told them to go ahead and finish it up, so it always ended up being a little more than they estimated going into it. It was okay. They did a really great job. They clean...

3,They did a good job on the power washing but they came out twice with out notice.
5,Overall happy with my experience. All calls were promptly returned and they were easy to work with --accommodated my changing schedule in stting up a wok date. Happy with the wok that was done and the attention to detail ---- making sure the mirrors were hung exactly where and how I wanted them. We agreed to an hourly rate since the job was small which worked out well.
5,"You will see many reports from me because they always do an excellent job. They are quick, courteous, respectful and always helpful. They are my number 1 choice for anything in my house."
5,"We are preparing the house for sale and needed a leaking toilet repaired, a shower head replaced, a vanity installed, and two faucets and two light fixtures installed. I was very pleased with their work, with the time it took, and with the price."
5,Very well. The guy that came out was very professional. We haven't had any issues with the work they did and it's been a few months.
5,"They did an excellent job! He was very punctual and was very fast in getting the work done. When they worked on the shrubs, they did a great job and came right out. I will definitely use them again in the future. I highly recommend this company!"
3,"Not too tidy or exact, but did a decent job. Jason, came without right tools and had returned later in week, nice kid."
5,"Excellent. I called in the morning and by early afternoon someone was there to figure out the problem and fix it. The House Doctors are responsive and kind, even apologizing for the problem. I will keep using them."
2,"The son of the owner came out to do an estimate about a week after I called. Pretty reasonable, though I suppose I was hoping it was going to be sooner since water leaks can do significant damage if left unrepaired. He came out and did the estimate, and said he would replace the flashing. He said someone would contact me that night with the dollar estimate (he never gave me a price at the time of ...

5,"Bob Vecchio responded to me via email and phone to let me know the cost, and that my gutters would be cleaned as soon as rain let up. That was on 10/15/2011 and our gutters were cleaned on 10/262011."
5,We are very pleased with the work Christian did.

I wasn't sure what work we wanted to have done but spoke with the owner, who said he would honor all the certificates, and finally settled on the two main projects. He said I could either purchase the materials myself or they would buy them for us. Si...

As ususal with the House Docotrs every thing went great. The next rain we had, no water leaked into my bedroom."
2,My call for a quote was returned on the same day. I was under the impression that someone would come by to assess the work that needed to be done (all outside work) and leave the estimate in my mailbox. I never received an estimate.
4,"I emailed, then phoned House Doctors. It took a while for them to get back to us, but then two workers came out in mid-August and surveyed the job and took some notes. We didn't set any specific times for them to work; they pretty much just showed up when they could. Eventually, I heard back from the company with a price, which we thought was pretty good. We never got a written receipt, but accept...

Three weeks later the work had still not been started. I contacted Bob, the owner, and his son Mi...

He said that he would send me a bill, have I not received the bill after about a week."

5,"They did a very thorough job and I was extremely satisfied with the work they did. If I need someone again to clean, I will be calling them."
5,"I selected the House Doctors through the purchase of a Angie's List 'Big Deal'. I found them to very responsive. I had several small jobs that were indidually not worthy of calling for help. But I couldn't and hadn't done them. They calculated a rate based on time, it was very fair. When they were quoting the job I had intended to use the coupon for I mentioned a few other projects that my husband...

3,"I emailed the company to get an estimate. I rec'd an email from them asking me to call them. I called and left a message, but never heard back from them. I called a second time a week later and was able to schedule a time for them to come out to do the work. They didn't provide me with an estimate. The handymen were supposed to arrive between noon and 1:30pm. I called at 10am to reschedule due to ...

5,"The House Doctor responded quickly to my report that the pilot light on my water heater had gone out and I couldn't get it relit. It was a very quick fix -- he cleaned the underneath of the water heater with a special brush and got it to fire right up. I just can't seem to get the knack of relighting the pilot light. Then, about 10 days later, it blew out again. Although I tried again and again, I...

3,"From the time I first called to request an estimate, it took roughly about 2 weeks for me to receive a phone call back. This was after I called 2 additional times and left messages. I do understand this may have been a busy time for repairs. I spoke with Mike who was very friendly and we discussed the work I wanted done. He had someone come out to do any estimate of the work we requested, some of ...

I actually found this out by accidentally mowing over the pole and completely ruining my mower. I have called many, ma...

5,"Cleaned gutters and downspouts. I had previously paid someone regularly to clean my gutters who got alot of leaves out of the gutters but didn't clean the down spouts or even the spout screens. Eventually I figured this out and called The House Doctors. They came out and got the job done. The next rain, water actually moved through the gutters like it is supposed to do. The House Doctors were very...

It worked out well because I was given a range of time they would arrive and they could stay as short or as long as needed to complete the tasks we identified. Everything was based on the hourly rate. All three women were thorough, on-time, polite and worked continuo...

He said he would have his son call me before 9:00 PM that night. No one...

5,My experience was good. They came out and I was having a problem with the gutter leaking. They cleaned it first and then had to replace the gutter. It has rained since the installation and it works great. When i call them they normally come within a day or 2.
2,"The workman arrived early on both days. The days were hot and the workman arrived in the afternoon of the second day. It was difficult to work in the heat. The work time was decided by the company both days. It was a bad situation both days becaause of the absence of tools, the work hours and the changing of work orders. Overall the experience was unsatisfing for the workman sent and me."
5,"It did take a gentle reminder, but they came right out and took care of it. I bought a Big Deal for the job and they did excellent work."
5,"Jason arrived on time and did a fine job pressure-washing the aluminum siding and awnings. It took about 1.75 hours, and he also washed the front and back concrete steps to the house."
5,"The crew from House Doctors did an excellent job of repairing all the damage, making the garage look even better than it did before! They worked hard in the terrible heat but did not complain--always pleasant, good communication and prompt. You can't go wrong with House Doctors!"
5,"I telephoned to request service at 11:00am, and the repairman arrived the same day, around 5:00pm. Exceptionally prompt service. The repairman cleaned out the clogged gutter and downspout in 5 minutes, and cleaned up the work area when he was done. Then he came into the house, and replaced the broken flush mechanism on my 1st floor bathroom toilet, and cleaned up the floor and the toilet fixture v...

1,"Despite two calls (left messages), no return phone call."
3,"I had contacted House Doctors on June 24th or 25hth 2011 to find out if they could help me with a gutter problem. On Sunday 6/26 I received an email telling me someone would be in touch very soon.

5,"We took advantage of a Big Deal for two hours worth of handyman work. Jim was efficient, professional, and personable. He moved from one task to another quickly, explaining what he had to do or could not do as he went and offering suggestions for how to accomplish other tasks. We were very pleased with what he accomplished. We have already asked the company to estimate other work for us."
5,"We found the House Doctors by searching Roofing on Angie's List. Our initial phone call was responded to very quickly and the problem was assessed and an estimate provided. The gentlemen who did the repairs were very knowledgable and friendly. They took pictures of the problem and explained what they did to correct the issue. We won't hesitate to use House Doctors again if the need arises in any o...

1,"Nobody ever returned my call like I was told. I finally called back thursday of the same week and left a voicemail stating that I had not heard back from them and told them I was told that I would get a call back on Monday and never received one.

5,"All I can say is Wow! My husband built a large cedar deck back in 2004, and we had just let it age naturally. When I saw the Big Deal on Angie's List, I decided it was worth a try. They came yesterday while we were at work, and it's like a brand-new deck! I didn't realize exactly how bad it had gotten until it was clean again. We will definitely use this service again in the future!"
4,"They did a great job, but I was a little disappointed because they were supposed to be here for two hours and they definitely left about 20 minutes earlier. He just did the front part of the house. I thought that he would do the back and at least do a part of the little patio. But he packed up and left."
5,"This went very smoothly. The owner's son, Mike Vecchio, was punctual and was able to give me a reasonable estimate for the work I originally requested. After the job started, I added some other work which was included without a problem and the additional cost seemed fair and reasonable. They worked at the house for at least a week and cleaned up after the daily work very well. They did leave bags ...

Bob Vecchio didn't charge me anything extra for this service. I felt very comfortable with Robert in the house. This is one of many satisfied experiences I have had with The House Doctors. Lynne B."
5,"Mike and Bob were great to work with, very courteous and professional. The person who did the actualy repairs was also very pleasant. They were a little late completing the project, but understandably so due to the weather recently. When I called to ask why the project was not complete, they returned my call promptly to explain."
5,"They did the whole job very solidly and finished everything off really nicely. They do really good work for a good price. They are quality people, and they discuss the project details and cost with you. Most of the time I like what they propose and am glad they did it."
5,I was so impressed with the work done that I hired them the next day to pressure wash my driveway as well.
5,They did a great job. I can't say anything bad about them. They did everything good. Overall experience was great!

2,"They wanted me to sign the contract before they would give me an estimate. He would give me the price over the phone but he wouldn?t give me a written quote until I signed the contract.

Even my realtor commented how good they were and asked for the contact information so he could refer them in the future. I would definitely recommend The House Nurses."
5,Very well. Provided reasonable range of estimates. Performed the work in a timely manner. Good job! Clean and professional workmanship.
5,The owner answered immediately when I called and was happy to give us an estimate. He called back a day or two later with the cost and I told him to go ahead with the work. The service was prompt an through. I would definitely use them again.
5,"Different workmen arrived on time, introduced them selves, explained what and how they would do their jobs, cleaned up and voila everything was taken care of."
5,"The light and door bell were quick repairs. The window extraction & replacement was an all day activity. All the workman were kind, cooperative and efficient. I trust this company the men they hire to work inside or outside my house. They are great and affordable plus reliable. I cannot ask for any better service."
5,"I think I told the whole story in the previous entry. Bob's employees are always quick to come out, punctual, and pleasant. The House Doctors have saved me many times before. And they can do so many different repairs."
5,"The workers came out the day after I called Bob at the House Doctors and asked for help. They did the work well and explained the problem to me and what they had done to fix it. They didn't leave a mess for me to clean up, but they cleaned everything up themselves. I'm a satisfied customer."
5,"These were issues we thought had been addressed last fall with a different company, but then we received violation notices from our city. So we chose House Doctors from Angie's List, because even though their estimate was quite a bit higher than another person's we looked at, we weren't certain the second person's estimate included the reconstruction work, and they didn't return our calls asking t...

5,They were responsive to my phone call. They came out immediately and did the siding repair and were quick to call me back within a day with the estimate on the roofing repair. They accommodated my schedule. They did a really nice work. The guys who came out were really very nice and polite. I would use them again in the future too.
5,It is important to give a detailed list to the people cleaning your home. Be very specific as to what should and should not be cleaned.
5,Good experience. Called the day before the appointment to confirm. Professional and courteous. Good work and neat.
5,I called Mr Vecchio and told him I needed my gutters cleaned. He sent someone out to do the work within 5 days. Everything went very well. I have used the House Doctors in the pass to clean my gutters and I will use them again.
5,"Overall, it went well and didn't take very long."
5,"The house doctors did a great job, we were having issues with water damage. The water was penetrating through the roof, the house doctors identified the problem quickly, gave a very reasonable estimate, and got the job done in 1 day. They were very honest and explained what was causing the issue. I would highly recommend using the house doctors."
5,"He came 3 days earlier during rain, and he did an A+ job. Mark was who worked on my projects, and I would like to use this company again."
5,"It went excellent. They fixed the windows and cauked them. There was a problem with the cauk and they came back and fixed it and it was fine. I had called them about doing this job, but the weather turned bad. As soon as it was nice they called and came out and did the work."
5,It turned out great. They took care of it very quickly and it is back to normal. They are very dependable and efficient.
5,"In the beginning of March, we had an unusually heavy rainfall with a foot of snow already on the frozen ground. A few days later, I noticed dark spots in the carpet of the finished side of the basement. I later determined that water had leaked through the wall and soaked into the carpet, carpet pad, and paneling along one side of the basement. Presumably, the house (built 1951) had no waterproofin...

2,"When I called about the bill he said his son had been out to my house twice, once last fall and once a few days ago. Neither time did I know he had come out nor did I know what work they had done until the bill came, which isn’t the way people generally do business. They should give you an estimate first, and they should tell you when they’re going to come. I know they didn’t flush the gutters and...

It was, again, a great experience a...

The gentleman performed a thorough job and the window screens look great now.

1,They said they would come to give us an estimate and didn't show up.
5,"Bob calls to see if all my leaves are down and when I give the high sign he sends his people out. They are polite, and neat."
5,"First, I thank House Doctors for calling to remind me that this needed to be done. It was on my list but they were looking out for me. All I did was give them the word, as in previous years, and they came out to get the job done quickly, efficiently, without fanfare and at a reasonable price. This is typical of my experience with House Doctors."
5,"As always, The House Doctors came as promised, were very professional and did each job with care and expertise. And, after they've completed each job, they always do a great job of cleaning up. They have yet to disappoint me."
1,I made an appointment for a quote but they did not show up and did not call. I went with another company.
5,It went great. We have been using them for about 3 or 4 years. They always do a good job and they are not pricey. They are very easy to work with.
5,"The job went very well. I called the House Doctors yesterday to schedule the gutter cleaning, and they were here this morning to perform the work."
1,"I called to get an estimate for a leaking roof and other roof problems. When they finally called back, on a Tuesday, they said they could come out the following Monday at 2:30. I took off work early and sat there waiting. Nobody showed up, not even a phone call. Totally unprofessional to think people have the time to sit and wait for a no show. I wouldn't even consider using them after this."
5,"I always use the House Doctors. I called Bob. He discussed and asked questions. He sent someone to look up close and take pictures and show me what he found. We talked about time lines and when they came to do the gutters they did the roof as well. They removed siding, fixed flashing and replaced the siding."
5,I called Bod early that week and his son Mike arrived in a couple of days. They looked at the broken spindle and was able to repair it in about 30 minutes. This organization is great to work with.
3,"They came on the date agreed upon to go over my project. A week alter, I haven't received a return call or an estimate. I was told the workman would be getting with his manager for a figure, but I never heard back."
5,"Prompt estimate, prompt service, done exactly as promised and at the promised price. What more can you ask for?"
5,"Workmen repaired and replaced damaged garage door aluminum facia panels, and while they were here, they fixed sagging gutters and popped loose aluminum siding pieces back in place."
5,"Overall, everything went well. They cleaned up each day and followed-up to be sure I was happy, The kitchen looks great and I plan to use them again to paint a couple more rooms."
5,"I contacted Mike for an estimate to have a thorough cleaning done after construction (plus our home just needed an extra dose of dusting.) We received our estimate promptly and scheduled our cleaning date soon after. Angela and Ashely arrived at the house right on time and I provided them with a list of specific areas to target, as well as special cleaning instructions for certain pieces of furnit...

5,"We are very satisfied with the work that was performed. The workers were able to minimize the amount of dust generated during the repair process, carefully covered areas prior to painting, and cleaned up the work areas at the end of each day."
5,"As always, House Doctors was extremely responsive. The door was fixed quickly and professionally."
5,They did a very professional job and they cleaned up everything after the jobs were all done. We would definitely use them again.
5,"House Doctors came out and gave me an estimate within a few days. He told me it would be a couple of weeks before the work could be done and it was performed within that time frame. Since all the work was on the exterior of the house, it was not necessary for me to be there when it was done. Therefore I was not present when the work was done but it was completed in one day. When I came home I was ...

5,Their price was reasonable. They talked us through the process. They were empathetic to my elderly parents situation.
5,the plumber had to bring in the big guns to get the drain clear and then he went the extra step and replaced some old plumbing under the sink and resealed the connections. Now everything drains beautifully!
5,"John proceeded to remove the old brick and the cracked top deck. He added a new cement foundation to build upon. He did a beautiful job of building the brick structure. Then he placed the original stone steps in place. The concrete deck was poured on top of a support brace in the center of the deck. He also poured concrete to replace the old concrete at the base of the steps extending to the black...

5,"The project took awhile mostly due to unforeseen circumstances, but the job was done excellently, we were very happy with the work."
5,"They installed the new shingles with ones that closely matched the old ones. They went up on the roof with a garden hose and found exactly where the leak was. They then thought they patched it but after testing found that the leak was actually under what they initially patched. They then fixed it again and got the leak. I'm glad that they tested for the leak again after the firtst fixe because it ...

5,"It went very well. The House Doctors are professional, thorough, and punctual. They are also very attentive to customer service. The House Doctors do an excellent job."
5,Very impressed with the professionalism of this company. Will follow up if I have the work done by this company.
5,"The overall experience was excellent. The professionalism of the service workers and the follow-up was outstanding. They were very competitive and responsive. The work itself was exceptional as well. The wonderful thing about using this company was the fact that I was able to get alot of jobs done with using only one company. I'm planning to have them do some construction/roofing work for me in th...

5,"Reliable, friendly & excellent quality. I never had a bad experience with The House Doctors."
5,Job was neatly done and I didn't even know they had taken care of things until I returned from vacation. I use the House Doctors all the time for advice and work. Bob will discuss the project with me and then when I am ready they put it on their schedule. I have never been disappointed.
5,"It was great. They did everything that we discussed. If anyone is considering using House Doctor, they won't be disappointed."
5,"I was very pleased with everything. Patrick had first come out and tried gluing the part so that it sealed properly. He even took a picture of the part, in case it did not work and had to be replaced. He did not charge me at all for this visit!! He said it might not hold and I should call him if it does not. It worked for about a week, and then it started running again. I called and because he sti...

5,"The process was exploratory so steps followed, while they could not positively identify the leak, were logical and aimed for the best result. The final test will be a hard rain, but I am fairly confident that the leak should be stopped."
5,"The work was done very well, the cleanup was great, they were very careful, and the results were excellent. The crew members were very professional, knowledgeable, and pleasant. They have done other work for me in the past, and I've consistently been very pleased."
5,"The House Doctors handled all repair, cleaning and painting very quickly after our call and settling on a quotation. The gutter work was completed quickly, thoroughly and professionally within one day of my request. The staining of the house required two days which included a thorough inspection, scraping, and repair of warped siding and insect holes. Attention was paid to heavily weathered areas ...

5,"During the quote visit, I indicated that I would not be at home when the cleaners would come, so I wanted to give them a key. Mike did not want to take a key. He said I should ""stash"" a key somewhere outside my house. I was not comfortable with this option. This is the only reason I did not use this service."
5,"Within 20 minutes, the plumber was here and fixed the issue. I can just rave about them and they are such nice people!"
5,They are great. They have the same crew come out each time. They are wonderful cleaners and they are very nice.
5,"On a Sunday night I immediately called Bob Vecchio from the House Doctors. He got back to me instantly.I was very distress about the damage to the room, and Bob was very reassuring and helpful in the whole process. The next day he sent workers over to removed the damaged furniture, the rugs, the floor and to removed the mold and run fans. The did a great job. The house doctors, put up dry wall, pa...

5,"Excellent, very professional, timely , and courteous"
5,I was contacted by telephone and given an estimate. I was told that the stone would have to be ordered I was contacted when it was ready and the worker arrived on time and completed tne repair. The date may not be exact.
5,The entire experience was excellent - - all phone calls promptly returned; work done as promised on schedule. Very professional people and high quality work. They do much more than flooring and tile.....we will be sure to call them first for any future needs.
5,"called Bob regarding the problem. He immediately went to my house the following day to get an overview of the problem and the work needed to fix it. called me the same day regarding the details of the work and how much it would cost. once i agreed on the price, he came the next day and fixed it. the good thing was that i need not have to be present at the residence both during his inspection day a...

5,They were prompt with estimates and work done. Quality was excellent. They returned promptly when called to fix a problem that arose. Painting was neat with no drippings left behind. Easy to deal with.
2,"I was told by the gentleman who answered that he would come within a day or two, look at the house, walk around to measure the gutters and he would leave an estimate in the mailbox. He took our address, name and phone number. Well more then 2 days went by, we received our other estimates, but none from him. He never called, nor did he ever leave an estimate. I would be very wary of calling him aga...

5,Overall it was an excellent experience.
5,It went very well and work was timely.
5,"My wife called them in the morning and they were out the same day and got the job done very quickly. Very responsive, very prompt."
5,This is the second time that I have used House Doctors. This gutter was in an akward spot to get to. They came when I wasn't home and did the repairs. Bob called me that evening and told me exactly what they had done. They are a company that you can rely on to show up and to do professional work. They will take on small jobs and do a variety of work.
5,They did everything they said they would. They did a high quality job and worked hard. No issues with the service.
2,They welded the hinges to my gate and put the screws through the post and had it opening toward the sidewalk away from my property. This is a problem because it will block people walking on the sidewalk when the gate is open. They also cracked the gatepost when they were working. The two gateposts are different sizes so the gate is crooked.
5,"Excellent! He was professional, fast and courteous."
5,They were excellent. Hauled everything away when they were done.
5,"We live in Florida and recently purchased a double in Lakewood that will be our summer home when hubby retires. We currently rent out both the lower and upper unit. A new tenant was moving into the upper apt and we needed the unit to be move-in ready. I decided first to search for someone that could do the total job instead of hiring several different companies. And that's how I found The House Do...

5,"The repairs were done when I was working, and everything was taken care of when I got home."
5,"They were very timely, respectful, even charming. Good sense of humor, extremely reasonable in cost, great quality of work, so great to see so many things done I've wanted done for so long. I was amazed at how clean they left everything, even after warning me that there might be a lot of dust from repairing drywall. I'm working with them now on refencing my yard."
5,I have used them for other projects. They do good consistent work.
5,"THey worked closely with me on dates to start, including flexibility around our vacation. A snafu occurred between the original plans and the architects they involved. However, The House Doctors were totally responsive to the issue and ""made good"", resulting in a nicer design than was originally planned. We're so glad we finally added a deck to our home. We've been using it morning and night. With...

5,"I am so pleased with the House Nurses. They are very professional and friendly. I enjoy having them in the house, and so do my kids. I plan to use them for as long as they are around!"
5,"As always, working with Bob Vecchio of The House Doctors was easy and worry free. Appointments are set up promptly (once the windows came in) and work was completed in a timely and professional manner. They always do an excellent job and always clean up after themselves. We are grateful to Bob for all the work he and his guys have done for us."
5,They first went to take a look at the shed and called me with an estimate. I agreed to the price and told them it wasn't an emergency or anything. But they actually got it done the very next week. I was very pleased. Hardly any trace of the shed and/or junk was left. Good work and very efficient.
1,"I had used The House Doctors a few times during the past several years for odd jobs and had nothing but very good things to say. That was when I was dealing with Bob Vecchio. This time it was his son, Mike. The whole experience was bad. I called because the City was doing a point of sale inspection and -- since timing was going to be critical -- I asked that they come to the house to walk through ...

5,"Both times I have used them they have been punctual, friendly, efficient and detail-oriented. The have a good sense of how many people to bring and how long it will take. While its a little more than I would like to spend, the job they do lasts longer so I think the cost averages out in the end."
5,The work had to be done because we were in violation of the housing code. The company responded promptly to our request for an estimate. They began the work three days later and completed it in three days. We are very satisfied with their performance.
5,"They were great. They brought out a representative from Sherwin Williams and Benjamin Moore to consult on what type of paint to use. They were friendly,used lots of tarps and did a profesional job with good cleanup. It took a lot of labor to prep the surfaces to be painted."
5,They did a very profesional job. A lot of labor was involved because they had to remove slates from the roof to attach the straps. They used twice as many straps and secured them with screws instead of rivets. I am confident these gutters will not tear off during the winter.
5,Great! I had a tight work schedule and they worked with me. As usual they got back to me quickly and the work was scheduled and completed with in the same week. Bob & Mike Vecchio run a great company!
5,"Quality and professional work, reliable and friendly. Would hire them again and again."
5,"The House Nurses arrived earlier than expected and I was pulling into my driveway as they were calling their supervisor for instructions as to whether to stay put or go. They said they had finished their previous job early. To their credit, they did not leave. I showed them what had to be done and they got right to work. It was a job because my parents are very old and don't see well. Their home i...

5,We have used House Doctors several times for different projects. Their employees are very knowledgeable and helpful
5,"Everything went very well. They're very prompt, courteous, and take the time to do the work. They made sure that they took care of whatever the problem was."
5,"It went very well. They were on time, done quickly, and it looks good. They are very professional. They were very responsive to my questions."
5,"They were professional, compassionate and timely. I was extremely pleased with their service. I would highly recommend this company to others."
5,"Original phone call was returned promptly. Service was performed quickly following. Cost was a little more than i've paid in past, but work was done well - no ladder dents on my gutters and everything was well cleaned after."
5,"This is the second time we've used House Doctors for repairs. We first used them in the winter of 2009/2010 when we had an ice dam. They came out and fixed the area within a day. This week, we called them again to fix an area in the kitchen ceiling that had also been damaged by that same ice problem. They came exactly when they said they would, did exactly what they said they would do, and charged...

2,"Took almost a week for them to come out to look at my overhang and fencing requirements, then it took another four days or so to get a quote on the overhang, and the quote was not what I asked for. I never did receive any quotes for fencing."
5,"This is the second time that we have hired this company. They are prompt, professional, and reliable. We would use them again. When delayed on another job because of the weather, they phoned and let us know that they would be coming the next day. They were careful with their ladders around all our plants and flowers. The first time they worked for us, they repaired ice damage and we were very sati...

5,Very professional staff. Punctual. Easy to contact and set up an appointment. Very satisfied overall. Would use again and recommend to others.
5,Overall the project went very well.
5,"A straightforward job. I called House Doctors to take care of the venting problem in the attic and while they were at the house for an estimate, they noticed a problem with the soffit. (This is something that I had noticed before but did not know how to repair). They came up with an strightforward solution. Both jobs were done expeditiously with a high degree of professionalism."
5,Start to finish I was keep informed. They had a cancellation called us and the work was completed earlier expected. The roofers stayed on the job eating lunch while they worked. They replaced a light fixture in the bedroom that fell because of the pounding on the roof at no charge. They took pictures of the rotted roof came down to explain how they would replace it. Very efficient.
5,"Excellent. Both workmen were personable, thorough and cleaned up after themselves."
5,A positive experience in every respect.
5,"I needed to get the repairs outlined by the city as part of a required sale inspection, in preparation for selling my house. The repairs were a long list of things which ranged from replacing wood in the garage and repairing the garage door, to fixing faucets and painting the bathroom. Basically, I gave the list to Mike Vecchio and he and his crew did the repairs quickly and professionally. Along ...

He and I went over all the things I wanted cleaned and he called me back about I week later and gave me a quote.

They have responded as quickly as I have asked and done everything that I have asked. Their fees are quite reasonable - I have never questioned their invoices. They have done floor repairs (wood/ tile replacement), plumbing repair, small roof repai...

5,"As always, it was so easy dealing with The House Doctors. Bob Vecchio recommended that we replace the attic fan and we trust Bob explicitly. Rod, the electrician, called in the morning on Sunday and came that afternoon to replace a fan in the attic. He always is friendly and professional."
5,"The House Doctors rose to the challenge of painting our garage. The painters were able to come sooner than we expected. They matched the existing colors perfectly. And -- the real challenge -- they were able to paint the back of the garage where there was no pavement, only rocks, leaves and garden clippings. It rained for several days while they were working, so it took over a week until the job w...

I'll take this opportunity to discuss previous work that I think I reported before, but I'm not certain: - Remodeled downstairs bathroom, installing new drywall and painted walls. - Installed new side, front and family room doors. - Garage: Removed mo...

5,"As usual, it was a smooth and timely project. The company showed up when expected, the work was done professionally, and when I thought there was a problem they were ready to come back immediately. Luckily there was no problem once I learned how to use the system. Its reassuring to know that The House Doctors are out there when I need them."
5,"As always, the guys came on time with a smile. They got right to work and did a wonderful job. We are very pleased with the end result. They also always clean the area when they are done."
5,"Rod was always prompt and called if he was going to be late. He was also very courteous. Initially, the ungrounded outlets were grounded to the cold water pipe and the ground wire was too exposed for my liking, so I hid it more and resecured it with tie wraps instead of electrical tape. I also rerouted the wires in the attic because I didn't like how they were laying across the insulation. After d...

Chopped ice, pulled snow off roof, fixed and put up extra brackets for me. ...

5,Mr. Vecchio was very professional and everything went smoothly. He explained that he couldn't paint the gutter section because of the cold temperatures. This worked out well since we plan to replace the gutters and add heat strips this spring. We've asked him to come back and do this work too.
1,"Initial call to Bob who referred me to his son Mike. We set up time for Mike to come to my home but Mike cancelled the evening before due to medical emergency in his family, he referred me to someone called Patrick who told me he would call me 2/8/10 Monday to schedule visit the week of 2/8/10.

He showed up on time, brought the paint I asked for and completed the 2-coat paint job on the walls...

We have had House Doctors do work in the past and will continue to use them, as we are pleased with the quality of their work, their responsiveness to the client, and their professionalism."

5,The job was well done. They have cleaned my gutter in previous years as well.
5,"THIS WAS FOR WORK DONE IN 2009. I called The House doctor because his service list included repair of vinyl siding. Was very difficult to find someone to do a small job such as this one. Mr. Vecchio answered the call, was very professional and came to my home at my convenience. The job was completed in under an hour and he was able to use leftover siding that I had in my garage."
5,"The work was done in a very professional manner. I called to discuss what the problem was and what needs to be done and the very next day The House Doctors were here to do the work. Not only do The House Doctors do prompt, excellent work but they always clean up after themselves as well."
5,"As always, The House Doctors were prompt, cheerful and courteous. I have used this company repeatedly and will continue to do so. Their work is consistently outstanding."
5,Everything went well. I would definitely hire them again. I am making a list of possible jobs for them. I have also given their name to other co-workers.I will always call on them to do my handyman jobs.
5,"The firm responded within a few hours to my request for help.Its employees were efficient in the performance of their tasks,and professional in their undertaking."
5,They did a great job! They were a little pricey. They came in and were quick. I barely got a chance to talk with them while they were here. I mostly talked to the guy over the phone.
5,"They were quick, got right to the job and did excellent work for me. It was a relief when they were able to come so quickly and prevent gutter damage."
5,"I called Bob Vecchio in the late afternoon with an unusual request. I needed a dead deer in our backyard to be taken away. Once again, Bob proved to be my ""go to"" guy. I shortly received a call back from him to tell me that someone will be at my house early the next morning to haul away the deer. As promised, a group of guys were here on time and took care of the problem. Bob has never failed me."
5,excellent. I can't believe how nice the two rooms look.

5,"The repairs were done promptly, and at the end of October, when the weather was not particularily nice. As of today (January 2010) we have had rain and snow, and have had no further problems with leaking in the chimneys."
5,"This repair was done very promptly--we got a response the same day, and the plumber that came out to evaluate after work at 5pm was able to fix the pipe that same evening. We really appreciate the dedication to getting a potentially damaging problem like a pipe leak fixed so promptly."
5,"This repair was carried out promptly. The repairmen on the scene were good enough to take photos of the problem they found on the roof and show them to my wife, so she could evaluate the issues without having to go up on the roof. Quick and professional work."
5,Jill does an outstanding job. She goes above and beyond what I would expect.
5,Called owner-operator and stated problem. He and partner came out a few days later in snowy weather and fixed problem.
5,"Bob was great. The electrician who did the work was great as well, I just do not remember his name. The price may be a little high considering nothing was very extensive or complex. However, they were available right away and got the job done quick and clean. I had asked Bob about a plastering job and he said his son would contact me about that, however I never heard from the son and ending up hir...

5,I asked that the job be done only if the weather was above freezing. This is alway the problem because you can't do a good job when the gutters are frozen. So they waited till a day above freezing and came and did the work. They put the leaves in a bucket and did the job fast. Two men came out.
5,"On a dreary Saturday morning, I discovered rain leaking in the ceiling of a guest bedroom. A quick look at the roof showed that a large number of shingles had blown off in a recent windstorm. A few frantic calls to roofers yielded only one who could take immediate action - The House Doctors called back in minutes, and by afternoon a large tarp had been installed on a very steep 3rd floor roof, pre...

5,"They were very prompt, professional, and got the job done. They cleaned well after they were completed with the work and hauled away all debris."
5,"The communication was impecable. Eeryone arrived one time and worked very quickly and efficiently. They moved the washer and dryer from the garage to the laudnry room, hooked up both and made sure they ran effectively. There was an existing issue with a drain pipe which they identified and helped to fix. They made sure everthing was in proper working order before they left. Couldn't ask for me."
5,"The staff was fast, skilled, and highly professional. They did a wonderful job and I couldn't be more pleased. I told them generally where I wanted the items hung and they worked out all of the details and measurements. Everything looks great."
5,"Responded promptly to the phone message I left. Came to the house and reviewed everything that needed to be done with me. The crew did a very good job and cleaned up everything when finished. Bob checked the work when the crew had finished. I plan to have him back in the spring for work that needs to wait until then, no question that I would recommend them to others."
5,"We had a very good experience with House Doctors! They came out to evaluate the work ahead of time so that we could get an estimate and establish a date to have the work done. We liked that a team of workers arrived to complete all the work (there were five different items) and that it was done very efficiently. Even when I noticed that the front door latch they replaced was not the same type as t...

5,"Mike was professional and his assigned cleaning person Jill was prompt each week. We used the service on a weekly basis for about 5 weeks to solve a tight scheduling period in our lives. The results were good but not exceptional. The cost is higher than competitors but the competitors are not rated as well. If we need help in the future, we would contact them."
5,The overall experience was excellent. Mike Vecchio provided ongoing status updates thoughout the job. The work was completed in a timely and professional manner. We would definitely use The House Doctors again.
2,"It took 2 weeks and several phone calls to get the estimate. I was impressed with the owner, but no as much with with Son who I had the most contact with. He would call me at 9-9:30 at night, if he would call at all. I chose not to have them complete the work."
5,Everything went well. They were very neat and allowed me to inspect the completed work before they left. They did an especially good job with the hand rails.
5,"Got water damage, called insurance co. got The House Doctors name from Angie's List, called them up they came out in couple days gave me a quote. Once bad weather passed they came out and fixed all they said they would in a timely manner and were very proffessional. Was pleased when I recieved my bill and saw that it was exactly what they quoted me. Will probably be calling them for future pojects...

4,The price was reasonable. There was a little miscommunication about the job but that was cleared up. They were responsive.
5,"They had a lot of good reviews, so that is why I went with them. They are not quite done completing the work yet."
5,"They are awesome. We had a repairman install a washer wrong which resulted in water flooding our bedroom. The repairman did nothing and after a week the walls started to bow, the carpet began to smell and turn brown. I called the house doctors and they were at my home THE NEXT DAY! Complete repairs were done in 2 business days."
5,"We have been impressed with our service for a few months now. The same young lady arrives at our home every two weeks to clean: she is pleasant, professional and thorough. We shall be long term clients with The House Nurses!"
5,"The paint job looks great and the price was very reasonable. I have had The House Doctors do several projects on my house and will continue to use them. The owner Bob, and his son Mike, are prompt and professional, and to date I am very happy with the work performed."
1,"He came out Monday and went through the house with me and I explained what I wanted. He told me he would contact me the next day with an estimate. It is now Friday, and I haven't heard anything."
5,"I called Bob at The House Doctors and his men were there the next day, installed the water heater, removed the trash before I returned home. As always, his men were courteous, neat and clean and did an excellent job."
5,"Exisitng stove not working which was electric, decided to get a gas stove so had to have gas line extension from basement, and also had to have new electrical plugs install for new overhead microwave and one for the stove. the response time was fast and work done by plumber and electrician in the same day"
5,"I was amazed. My first e-mail to them was on Wednesday. Email was returned that evening. We spoke on phone around 10:00 a.m. on Friday, and negotiated and agreed on a price. I requested work be finished within two weeks. Around 4:30 p.m. the same day I got a call the work was finished! The bill arrived a day or two later and payment sent back immediately. The work and yard appeared clean and neat....

2,"The son came out and addressed me by my first name. I was upset with that. Then when the estimate was complete I thought the price was very high. There was some work in the garage and I was going to have it painted and when I changed my mind, he took $1000.00 off the whole estimate."
5,Excellent work for an excellent price; would gladly use them again.
5,They came and did the work and left. They did just as they had promised they would. Their work is very neat. I highly recommend them!
5,Very high quality detailed cleaning. Got into every nook and cranny and made home liveable again.
5,"They prepared the house for painting by hand-scraping every inch, a HUGE job because it was peeling badly. They then did a terrific job of painting the base and trim. They did a side at a time so I could see the progress and it didn't look awful any longer than necessary. They were also incredibly responsible about keeping the gate across my driveway closed when they went to the garage for supplie...

5,"This was a great experience. I knew that this project would be expensive so I had put it off for a while until I could save the money for it. When I called Mike he came over as scheduled and gave me an assessment of the situation, the possible complications, and an estimate that was lower than one I had received several years ago. I asked if we could put off the job until the end of the summer and...

5,Excellent experience. Will definitely use in future.
3,"I left my name and number and basic details of the job with the father. The son called back that night and told me he would call over the weekend to schedule a date to come out and give us an estimate. We never heard back and after a week we went with another company. Possibly, the job was too small for them."
5,"Their service was prompt and efficient- came out the same day that I called! They had to come back to grout the tile once it was set, and we played some phone tag to schedule that visit."
1,A guy came out to check the house. I told him what I wanted to be done and then he said he will call me but he never called. He did not do anything as he didn't even call to give a quote.
5,"I had a great experience with the House Doctors. I have used them before for other work and was very happy with the quick response, efficient and effective work, and price. I called several companies for estimates on having the basement cleaned (concrete floor and concrete block walls) and the House Doctors' prices blew every other company away. They did a great job and the basement is back in wor...

5,It went very well and he did a great job.
5,"As always, working with The House Doctors is a pleasure. They come when promised and do the work that needs to be done in a very professional and friendly manner. One of the things I like about them is that they do almost anything that you need done. I call them the ""go to"" guys."
5,"Mike Vecchio and crew was terrific. Mike generally called on Sun evening when the work was actively going on to let me know the schedule and to check in. As mentioned above, the first roofer I had scheduled to repair the flat roof over the sunroom was unable to do the work due to over-scheduling. The House Doctors did it, and for a couple hundred dollars less than the first guy. Then...unfortunate...

5,They came to give us an estimate of what we wanted done and within three days they had the estimate to us and the job scheduled. Took a day and a half to complete. Terrific work.
5,"Because of some unforeseen conditions, my project took considerably longer to complete than what the company estimated. Even though the project took longer, the House Doctor did not increase the price and did not take short cuts. Instead, the company focused on creating a quality product. I even saw the foreman order his workers to reinstall a small piece of siding because it did not look right. W...

They did an excellent job putting up the fence. They...

When the same section of siding blew off in the next severe storm and House Doctor refused to warranty the completed work that was the last straw.

As a single woman, I need people who I can trust in my house. This company continues...

5,"I called the House Doctors, they returned my call, came out and gave me an estimate. I had an unexpected emergency, and wasn't able to go ahead with the project at that time. About a month later I called them again and they were able to fit me in the very next day, I was more than please with their quick response, and the quality of service they provided."
5,"The crew obtained a permit, removed the porch screens/panels, door, corner support post, trim, flooring and rotted floor joists and arranged for trash removal (basically, they demolished most of the porch except for the roof and brick foundation). They sistered the old joists (where needed) with PTL and replaced the tongue-in-groove flooring, replaced the old corner support with a 6x6 PTL post, re...

5,"There was a brief storm that caused some large tree limbs to fall on the roof directly over the wires to the house. I called Bob Vecchio and within a couple of hours his men came, cleaned away the tree limbs and debris and checked for damage. It was a wonderful experience to be attended to so promptly and professionally. I, once again, thank Bob for taking such good care of us."
5,"Everything went smoothly. Two men, Mike and Mark, came precisely at the scheduled time. After looking at the ceiling, Mike left and Mark did most of the work. Mike came back later. Since I was on the 2nd floor most of the time, I hardly noticed that they were here. The work was finished around 2:00. Mark took a lunch break in between."
5,They have come out and done several things for us over time. They are very good with their work and clean up well.
5,"I needed the gutters replaced along back line of my house. When Bob called me to give an estimate for the gutters, he told me that he noticed that there was moss/mold growing on my brick patio. (which was absolutely true!) So in addition to replacing the gutter, they power-washed the patio! The gutter looks great and so does the patio. The work was done promptly and, as always, the yard/work area ...

This included floors, walls, ceilings and all surfaces. They worked quickly and completely. I was impressed and relieved that everything was taken care of so well! I highly recommend this company."
5,The House Doctors cleaned and repaired crumbled tuckpointing on deep window wells of our home. Even cleaned out some moss that had heavily accumulated. Repaired area between lower jamb of backdoor and outside step. Screen replacement of patio door was done on the spot. Very professional work and good job cleanup.
5,"House Doctors have been great to work with and very responsive. They arrived at our house for the estimate and for the actual cleaning exactly when scheduled.

They have even recommended certain cleaning products that would be ...

The guys who came out were very professional and did a good job. I have since learned (the hard way) that the installation of the gutter heaters was completely wrong. They did not extend the cable down to the gro...

5,"House Doctors had just painted my house (beautifully!) last fall, and during the winter we had ice dam damage, causing huge icicles to pour down through our walls and out through the slats of the siding. The dirt from inside our walls melting into the ice caused dark stains on our brand new (beautiful) exterior paint. There was also significant interior paint damage where the ice dam was the worst...

This is not the first time we have used their services and we plan to have them perform other work as soon as the weather clears for outside electrical installations."
5,I called them to let them know what I had decided and they had never gotten back with me. I don't understand why I never heard from them after I told them I was ready for them to get started. He told me he was going to write up a contract and we could get started and he never called me.

4,"With the amount of money I paid this guys versus the other company that gave estimates, I think I am happy with the work done. I saved over five hundred dollars."
5,I called Fri. and Robert came that afternoon to look at what needed to be done. He came back the next day to do the work.-
5,Bob got back to me promptly when I e-mailed him. He told me his price up-front and stuck to it. The work was done within a couple of days and was top notch!
5,"It went very well and was completed within the time line I was given. I was kept informed as work progressed. Crew was punctual, extremely accommodating, and agreeable. Clean up was good."
5,"I called for an estimate and got a quick response. The price was comparable with other quotes I received. I have used the House Doctors for work on the exterior of my home before, and was pleased with their work and cleanliness on the job. They notified me the night before them came to do the work, and the work was completed in one day. I am please with the outcome."
5,This is the second time I have used there service. They cleaned up well after the service was completed and did a nice job.
5,Overall it was a very pleasant experience. Mr. Vecchio returned my calls in a timely manner and was willing to work with me in regards to the payment and the scheduling. I did not have to be home for The House Doctors to perform this job.
5,"I had felt cold air coming in from around the sides of my windows all winter, so I called House Doctors for their assessment and estimate. Another company had suggested work costing over $2200.

4,I called them and it took them a while to get back to me. Someone finally came out to take a look at my project. A few days later they called me to give me the estimate.
5,"The work was well done. They were very professional. Rescheduled their work to fix our leaks before it rained. My only suggestion, the crew should stop in or leave a note that explains what has been complete at the end of each day and if /when they will return. Overall they did a very good job!"
5,Great! Wish I could afford to have her weekly.
5,"Plumber called when I was told he'd call. He said when he'd be out and that he'd call half an hour in advance. Plumber didn't call half an hour in advance, but they arrived when they said they would. Plumbers didn't quote rate, and I didn't ask. Plumbers removed shoes, which I asked them to do. They were careful about dirt. Plumbers were pleasant and professional. Tub works fine now."
5,All of this went well and far exceeded my expectations.

This for me is a turn off as I don t want to be pointing out things to them that have not been done properly. I was disappointed in them and the quality of their work. They came out with not enough tools and the job did not look finished. The owner then had to come out for finessing thing...

5,"Bob and his team were prompt, as always. Hauled away all the debris and left the site clean and neat."
5,"We called the owner, who had the electrician call us back to schedule an appointment for a couple of days later. On the day he called to let us know his ETA. The guy was friendly and took about 15 minutes to do the work, which looks good. We received an invoice in the mail a couple of days later."
5,"Lori and Billy are a great team. They are prompt, work really hard and clean thoroughly. They are willing to do extras like clean the cat fur from the bottoms of the draperies. Each time Lori asks if I'm satisfied and if I see something that is missed they complete it right away. In additional, both are personable and pleasant ladies. I'm happy to have found them and to have their service!"
5,They came out and were responsive and they worked hard to get everything done. The service was excellent.
5,"I have used Bob and House Doctors before. The only downside was the back chimney was overlooked in the estimate, but I was given a significant price break because it was not my mistake. The mason was prompt and professional. The work looks great. I have some other jobs needing done, and I will definitely call House Doctors in the future."
5,"Great service--prompt, efficient, and trustworthy."

They were careful to make as small a hole in our ceiling as possible to locate the leak and quickly installed a new ceiling, so the room below the bathroom looks better than before the leak started. The newly tiled shower looks great. They were willing to accomodate our tile choice and were incredibl...

5,"I had a good experience with them. We communicated everything by phone. He came out, gave an estimate, and left it in my mail box. He was not pricey. Some of the bricks had broken and a lot of the mortar had come out. He came out when he said he was going to come and did the work. I never saw him. I reached home and saw the work was done. I wrote the check and mailed it to their address."
5,"I called for an estimate, and was seen very promptly. We started services within a week. Lori has spent about 4 hours cleaning our house. She gets a lot of good work done in that time."
5,"They did quality work, and they were not afraid to look beyond what they were going to do."

5,"I had very little, input, they did all the work."

I thought it was a bit strange that the price was different depending on the method of payment. That made me skeptical of their business practices. The quote did not include cleaning a large dining room or small bedroom (both at my request). They also would h...

5,It went very well. They began the work on schedule and finished much sooner than I had anticipated. They also did a few extra things for me beyond what I had contracted for.

I was very impressed with his professionalism and responsiveness. The price was $867.00 which I thought was reasonable based on them needing to replace the fascia board as well as the gutters being on the third floor and very difficult to get to."

Bob Vecchio answered the phone and said he would have someone to the house within 2 hours. The technician, Robert, arrived early.

Workers then came as scheduled the following Monday and did the work. They were professional, responsive to our needs, and did everything we asked of them. They finished promptly and gave advice on further measures that can be done to improve our roof overall."
5,These people were great. Responded quickly and with no hesitation to come to a condominium property that is usually serviced by its own maintenance crew who were unavailable and seemingly unable to properly address the problem.
5,"We like this company. They're very professional. They give you estimates on price and completion time. Their estimates are always right on. If there's a change in the cost or the time frame you're made aware of it well in advance so you can decide if you want to continue with the job. The workers are on time and the quality of their work is great. Clean up is fantastic, too. We've used them on a n...

5,They repaired the garage door so that it closes fully and moves easily. It hasn't worked this smoothly in a long time!
5,A very good experience. I e-mailed the company in the morning and had someone there that evening fixing the problem.
5,"I called the House Doctors on a Sunday after discovering water damage on a bedroom ceiling. I was hoping Bob would call me back on Monday morning. Well, he called me back on Sunday!!! He said he would send someone out the next day. On Monday, the roofer called me to let me know when he would be here. He showed up on time. He examined the roof and found 4 shingles were missing. He took a picture of...

5,"They came in with an estimate well under everyone else and did a job that I don't think anyone else could have done. The job was done roughly in a day, they had to come back the next day to finish up a small section instead of trying to do it in the dark and make mistakes. I was out of town when the job was done and when I came back I noticed that they had cleaned up so well, had I not known they ...

5,"They were very polite and they came right away, very timely. The man that had to come into the house was very polite. It was a nice experience."
5,"They provided the quote in a timely manner, arrived on time for the job, were professional, were conscientious and completed the job in a reasonable time period."
5,They are very friendly and professional.
5,"They were prompt. They gave us a quote, I called and said I wanted to go with it, so they came back out and did it quickly. They were friendly and took all their trash away. I've used The House Doctors several times. They are excellent and very responsive. They are not low priced but they get out and get things done when they say they are going to."
5,"It was the first time we used the company and had a good experience. We called them a few days before Christmas, and they were one of a few who could do the job within a couple days. Lori showed up the next day (a snowy day) and did a fantastic job. She not only cleaned the entire house thoroughly, but also organized each room in a way that was beyond our expectation. She used only the Green produ...

5,"It went very well. They were quick, efficient & it was a neat job & I had liked what they had done. I felt the price was pretty good. I would use them again in the future."
5,"There wasn't anything wrong with it. He just showed me how to turn it on. I was thrilled to death because I had been waiting to get my fireplace lit for a long time. The gentleman was very nice & said that there wasn't anything wrong with it & that it was clean & he just showed me how to turn it on properly & that was it. I would give him an A for an overall grade because he was quick, efficient &...

5,"Bob and his team were timely, professional and nice. Great job overall."
4,"Four men came. They were courteous and I was home at the time. They did work in a timely manner. They cleaned up the debris from gutters. I feel the company is honest and thorough. However, they came on a day when the gutters were frozen. It was not possible to get the gutters perfectly clean. They did the best they could. The next day the weather was 40 degrees and gutters were thawed. They could...

5,He mistakenly thought he was hired but he accepted the price from another estimate.

5,"The House Doctor's reports were the most encouraging of all those I read on Angie's List, so I emailed them on a Saturday afternoon with my requirements. I got a call and an email in return almost immediately, several phone calls over the next four days, and the job was completed 10 days earlier than I required. The job was completed on time and within the estimate, and the workmanship was excelle...

3,"After they did the work we needed them to come back and re-route some gutters and we found it difficult to get in touch with them. Once they finally got in touch with us, we still had to keep calling. Otherwise, all the people who did come out seemed eager to do the work. It was just the people you called that did not seem very businesslike at all."
5,"Dave and Scott who were the painters for my house were polite, on time & excellent painters. They also cleaned up each day so that there wasn't any mess around my house. The overall experience was excellent and I would use them again."
5,Very easy to work with. Scheduled appointment over the net. Showed up when scheduled. Very polite/very thorough. The price may have been a tad on the high side but that could also just be due to the sheer size of the house.
5,"They did an excellent job! I will definitely use these guys in the future. The guy was really courteous over the phone, and they were able to come out and do all the work without me having to be at home. He was very professional and good to work with."
5,"The crew was prompt, went to work immediately, and discovered that the job required additional parts. They explained the situation, indicated that they would return, and departed after cleaning up. The crew returned and finished the job successfully."
5,"One of Bob Vecchio's employees (Jay) responded to our inquiry. He was polite, prompt and provided clear, understandable information and pictures of the problems. We asked for an estimate of two different jobs. I chose to take care of the leaky skylight problem first and wait on the gutter work until Spring. They scheduled the work for a day that was weather appropriate since no one had to be home ...

5,"The work was done very well, and they came when they said they would. I am happy with the results. Their estimate was slightly higher than another company's, and I would have preferred a few days notice when scheduling the work rather than calling the night before to see if they could come the following morning, but I would still use them in the future."
5,They were very good & thorough. They were very neat & they did an excellent job. They were friendly & the response time was very good. They were professional & knowledgeable. I would recomend them & I already have.
5,"From start to finish I was very pleased with their response time and their work. Quote, scheduling, and the work all went smoothly. The job was done in a little over one day and follow up calls were made to make sure I was pleased. I would hire them again."
5,"It went well. Quick, professional, and I am satisfied with the work."
5,"My initial call was returned, a service date was scheduled and the work was performed all within 48 hours in a very professional and friendly manner."
1,"Because it took them so long to get back with me on the estimate and because they are too high priced, I won't use them at all."
5,"The work went very well. The House Doctors came and gave an estimate and payment details were worked out quickly and within a week the guys were on the job. They did a great job, in an efficient, professional, and friendly manner. Having the House Doctors was a very good experience."
5,"Very well. They got started within days of our decision to use them, had all work completed in about 3 days."
5,"Bob returned my call promptly and said it would take two men to do the job because of the weight of the mirror. When I said I wanted them to come as soon as the movers left, he said that could be done and it happened. They measured carefully before putting up each item. The mirror took longer than I expected, but I wasn't charged more because of this, and I appreciate the fact they took their time...

Most impressive is that they purchased ""green"" cleaners just for our house since the chemical cleaners bother my infant and preschooler. I mentioned it and they had everything by the next cleaning appointment. Lori is nice to have in the hou...

5,They were prompt and professional and the completed exterior work looks beautiful.
5,"The low voltage outdoor lighting system for my home had failed. One contractor wanted to redo the entire wiring system and would not even guarantee that changing the wiring would help. Rod came out and was organized, efficient, reliable, polite and on time. He also made helpful suggestions regarding what needed to be done. Everything works fine now and I am very pleased."
4,"It went pretty well over all. I thought it was a little bit sloppy, and I wasn't that impressed. But the job is done and that's that. I feel like I paid a little too much."
5,"Called The House Doctor and got an immediate response and talked with the owner who understood exactly what I was talking about. The House Doctor sent the correct craftsman to address and resolve the problem, the first time."
5,"I called Bob at the House Doctors as soon as we discovered the leaks. He had two guys out to look later that afternoon despite the fact that they were still very busy from a storm that had wreaked havoc a few weeks earlier. That was amazing. What else was amazing is that these two guys actually figured out what was wrong with my leaky window. Now, this area of the house has been leaking since befo...

5,"House Doctors are wonderful. They are professional and punctual. They come when they say they will and worked with us to identify the problem. We need a plumber, electrician, painter etc. and they coordinate all of the repairs. Everyone who worked for them was equally professional. They clean up as best they could and we were very happy with the quality of their work."
5,They used a laser for precision when they hung the items.
5,They did a good job. They spent 2 days on the job. They communicated well and worked within my requirments and I'd hire them again.
5,"The electrician was able to come to my house in the evening, which was great because I did not have to take a day off of work. He quickly diagnosed the problem and was done in about 20 minutes. I would highly recommend this vendor and would definitely use them again."
1,"I contacted Bob via email to which he responded. I had a number of city violations for my rental property that needed to be address ranging from roof repair to electrical work. Bob respond quickly to my email but was very rude, abrasive and lacked general customer service skills. He gave me a verbal quote on the phone and when I asked him to put it in writing so I could have a written estimate he ...

5,"They were prompt and returned my phone calls, everything cost what they said it would cost and I thought the prices were very reasonable. It seems like they can do almost everything and if they cant they will tell you."
5,"They were very professional, called when they said they would call, and showed up when they said they would. They took the time to explain the problem and show us the damage. They repaired the problem in stages to identify the water leak and did not just replace everything. They worked quickly and efficiently and completely cleaned up when they were done. The House Doctors are great for any job."
4,"Took much longer to get started than estimated. Took much longer to finish than estimated. Taking aside weather delays, which we understand, work days were typically short (about 4 hours on site), and on several good weather days they didn't work."
4,"The experience was not too bad. There is still a problem that they have to come back and fix. They answer my calls, and help me with my needs."
5,They have very good customer service. They actually care about there customer. They really strive for good ratings. They do good quality work as well.
5,They did a very good work but they were very expensive. I didn't have time to shop around but they did do a very good job. I would recommend them if you want to pay them.
5,"Excellent. The estimate was prompt and fair. The crew was a delight. The work was done quickly, efficiently, carefully, and there was nothing to clean up after they were finished. They also replaced wood where needed. I've had ongoing problems with water actually getting into my gutters becuase of the odd roof slant. We didn't know if the problem had been corrected at first because there was no ra...

5,"My schedule is a bit erratic, so there were some difficulties with the initial contact. They were very responsive and showed up exactly when they said they would. The crew was courteous and professional. The work they did looks great."
5,"Not professional. Finally came out to give the estimate, as requested."
1,"We called the House Doctor because one of our window wells leaked water when it rained and also to repair our front step. They charged $610 for ""tuck pointing"" work ($385 for the window well and $225 for the front step). The work they performed amounted to smeared quickrete around the window well and front step. The quality of the work was poor. The window well continued to leak (they did not fix ...

5,"Bob Vecchio replied promptly to my call. He was very knowledgeable, and suggested reasonably priced options. Bob even sent someone the same day to do a small light bulb change out. The repairs were completed in two weeks. The House Doctors were prompt, courteous, and professional. I will definitely use them again in the future."
5,Good experience. I called Bob Vecchio @ The House Doctors on Monday they looked at my fence and gave me an estimate on Wednesday - did repair Thursday of that same week. I had called a few other people before calling the House Doctors and Bob Vecchio was the only one who came through with his service.
5,"I called Bob at House Doctors on a Monday and told them I wanted an estimate whenever they had a chance to come out. Bob said they would be out in the next couple of days. On Wed. morning they called me and gave me an estimate which I accepted because it was a fair price and I knew they did good work reliably (had them do some other stuff last year.) Bob said they'd get to it early next week, whic...

2,"Overall, I am dissatisfied with how The House Doctors handled the process. At first, they did return my call and seemed eager to provide a quote to paint the exterior of our house. However, once it was turned over to the person who came out to our house, things went downhill. We were not offered a meeting to be present at the time of estimate, so there was confusion about what work did and did not...

5,It went very well and was done quickly.
5,"Overall, the job went well. The original roof was rotten and very leaky. Since the replacement there have been no problems."
5,"After assessment, the damper was just hung up and the contractor showed my husband what to do and suggested we get a fireplace door which would help keep out the air since we would not be using the gas fireplace."
5,"They were very professional, had a timely response, and high quality subs were used."
5,It was an excellent experience. He came at the earliest point of his time frame estimate which I liked. Most of the time you're waiting around. He was very prompt and did a nice job.
5,I would recommend them in the future.
5,Very well! I was given estimates for four different possible combinations of areas and gates so that I was very clear about my choices. The installers were extremely careful about my plants and treated my gardens with respect. The work was very nicely done and their cleanup was flawless. Everything about them was very professional.
3,They came out and gave me a estimate. They were to power sand the whole outside of the house but the person didn't want to sand the house. They gave me another person and they didn't even scrap the paint. They didn't want to do a lot of stuff.
5,Prompt estimate and work done when promised. Would use again or recommend.
5,"I was visiting my daughter for only a few days and was anxious to have these repairs done ASAP. After a few phone calls to places, the House Doctor responded and said they could do the work the same day. Within the hour I had a call from Robert. He was at my daughters apartment in no time. He was very professional, completed the work in a short time, didn't make a mess and from what I can tell did...

2,"We found the company on Angie's List. They had very high marks. The estimator told us that the project would take three workers all day to complete, in other words, about twenty-four hours total work time. We relied on their reputation through Angie's List and the estimator's assertion that the work was sufficiently complicated or time-consuming to warrant the $1,125.00 estimate. We agreed to have...

5,"I called the company around 6:30 p.m and the owner answered the phone. As this was not an emergency, he asked if his son could call me back the next week to schedule an estimate. The son, Mike Vecchio, did call me back the following week (around 8:45 p.m!) and scheduled the estimate for the week after that. He called again the night before to confirm our appointment, and arrived at the specified t...

4,They did what they said they were going to do. They were prompt and their work was fine. They were quite a bit pricy but none the less they are pretty good.
5,It was great! It was done at a good price. Bob is always very nice.
5,They did an excellent job of cleaning the gutters on my house. All the gutters are working fine now. After the job was done they cleaned up the mess that was made. I will use these people again.
3,"He was informative and he gave me some information. I thought that his prices were a bit high, I would have used him if it were not for that. He was a little pushy with his services and price and thought he was being fair."
3,In the past they did a great job. They were very professional. They explained exactly what they were going to do. I was very pleased with them. But now I am not so pleased because they have not responded.
5,They guys were really polite. They knew what they were.
5,"They are very responsive, you call them and they call you right back which is rare in the contracting world. The workers do high quality work and I think that they were just outstanding. The only down side was that they were expensive, the highest out of a few other quotes I got but they were able to get to me promptly."
4,"They would only give me an oral estimate, not a written. It was difficult to compare estimate with the others I had. This is the main reason I did not go with them."
4,"Work was completely promptly - however no note was left on my home to let me know that the work was done, nor had I received a call. I did not receive the bill until late August, so some sort of notification would have been beneficial to me, the customer."
3,"The company promptly repaired a broken window in an older home. However, they did not finish the job. They left the new wood unprimed and unpainted. Also while the carpentry looks fine from the street, from the inside of the house it looks clunky and unprofessional. The repaired window frame looks nothing like the other window frames from the inside. They charged $150 for this unfinished work. In ...

3,"While this was a functional solution, it stands out to anyone looking at the garage that there is/was a problem. There's just no way gray cement block matches with orange tile. I was not consulted before they made the decision to go with cement block. I had used them before for some tuck pointing of the brick on my house and they did a good job on that and I expected better than I got this time."
1,"They had to come out twice to finish the plaster job. I don't think they are terrible but I wouldn't recommend them or ever use them again in the future. He was rude, and condescending to me."
4,"They responded quick enough. I wanted my chimney cleaned and inspected, they subbed that out to another company. They called the day before they were to come out to clear it with me first. I would hire them again for minor handyman work around the house."
5,"Everything went well. I had called on Saturday and Bob Vecchio responded promptly as usual and Rod, the electrician, came out as promised early on Monday morning. He had replaced the fixture so quickly and quietly that I didn't even realize he was there until I heard his truck door after the job was done. Jaye the fence repair person came out with his crew after I had called Bob again to say that ...

5,Excellent work. It ended up being more work than I expected. I called and asked permission for them to do more work. Mr. Vecchio was very accommodating and willing to work within my budget.
2,I did not use this contractor because of their unresponsiveness. Cost also turned out to be unreasonable.
4,"Prompt reply to my request for an estimate. They had to get letter from HOA for approval and then get approval from city. That took several weeks. Once they started on the job, it took about a week longer that they said it would and they had to modify the plan."
5,"Thanks to the abundance of 'helicopters' this year, my gutters were sprouting miniature trees. In addition, my front gutter had become progressively more off kilter in the year and a half that I've owned the house. Mr. Vecchio was very responsive in returning phone calls, getting his crew out in a timely fashion. He even tried to save me money in relation to my front gutter (the board it hangs on ...

I waited to do the pressure washing job because I thought I would hear from them, and was disappointed...

4,I recommend them and will use them again.
5,I called and they performed the work within a week or two. Very responsive.
2,"Their quote was pretty high, I thought on the electrical. There was a lot of work to be done of course but when we got other quotes they weren't quite so bad."
5,"We had them out to look at two different jobs: the gutter on our garage and also the gutter on the front of our house. They were able to fix our garage gutter very quickly, but were reluctant to do any repairs to our house gutter because they discovered it was installed by another company (before we bought our house) and they told us we may want to call them first because that company's warranty m...

5,They perfect and wonderful. They were on time. They cleaned up after themselves. I had to bring them back out. But it took one call and there was no problem.
5,"They have painted a bedroom, and drywalled and plastered the ceiling in the basement, sent out an electrician to install ceiling fans, and put in crown molding in. They are excellent. They are punctual. The estimate is within a range and is limited to that. The work is always done well, and they are sticklers for cleanup. It is usually finished in the time they give you. Overall, it's what you wan...

4,We called to get a quote on some bricks to be replaced on our front steps. When Harvey came out he said it could be done but I'll also had him take a look at an outside window frame that needed repair and was more urgent. He quoted us on both. We asked him to just repair the window. Due to the weather it took him a few weeks to come out. We were satisfied with the work and would hire again.
4,"They did a good job, finished within a day."
1,"After the original work was complete, a man came to the house to look at and measure the bathroom floor. I would have needed to buy a piece of vinyl flooring 12 ft by 6 ft to cover the floor. About 2 hours later, and I'll admit while I was upset about the first job, Bob called and left a message that the replacing the floor (I would have to buy the floor separately) would cost $950, and he wanted ...

After the whole job was done, a guy came to look at t...

5,House Doctors submitted a detailed list of items to be done with a price for each item. We okayed the items we wanted done at the time and the work was completed promptly. An itemized list of what was done was mailed to us with the bill. All work was timely and professionally done. They cleaned up all garbage from their project.
5,They are very competent. They have a lot of different people who do a lot of different things. They are very respectful about being inside my house and home. Their pricing is very reasonable.
5,"The experience was excellent. From the beginning, the communication was great. They called me back the same day with a detailed estimate. They did the work according to the estimate. The workers were very professional and courteous. The work was high standard and met our expectations."
5,I have used them before and they have always done a great job. They do a great job of handle all of my questions and inspections. They are very polite and professional and i will use them again.
4,They were very punctual and very professional and very great. I would recommend them and they were a tad costly so I would not hire again but their work was great.
5,"Two men came and were polite and neat. I asked them to use a drop cloth and take off their shoes and they did. I had originally asked for 2 light fixtures to be installed, but then asked for a third to be installed, and he did it quite willingly. They were friendly, answered all my questions and did exactly what I had asked them to do. They painted the walls, baseboards and landing area going up t...

4,They were very friendly when they were there working. They were very professional about the job. They had showed up on time to do the work for me.
5,"He is very reasonable. He does charge a service fee, so he likes to make it worth your while and do several jobs at once so you get your money's worth."
5,"We hired them to do the work in the winter, so it took a while for them to get started as all of the jobs, especially the painting, required dry weather. We were generally pleased with their work."
5,"Placed call on a Friday morning, and was able to have the repair service performed that evening (even though I wasn't expecting service that quickly)! From the initial phone call, to the completion of the work, I was very pleased with this service provider. I wouldn't hesitate to use The House Doctors again, and will recommend them highly."
5,It went very well as usual. I've used this company before and they are very responsive. Bob called me back promptly after my initial call and said Rod would call to set up an appointment to come out. Rod came out to the house as promised and did the repair work.
5,"Everything went extremely well. Terrific service. The 10 year old garbage disposal that we had in the house ruptured, and sent water all over the inside of the cabinet and floor. I looked on Angie's List, selected The House Doctors, gave them a call, and they did the replacement on the day after I called, the serviceman arrived exactly on time, did the job in less than an hour. They put in a very ...

5,Workman cleaned up after himself. Fair price. Excellent communication and follow-up with customer.
5,The awning was over a second floor porch. High winds during a storm ripped the awning off the house and dropped it onto the porch. The company replaced siding that had also ripped off and then jacked up the awning (it's probably 10 ft. by 10 ft.) and anchored it more securely to the house.
5,"Two representatives arrived on a Saturday afternoon to look at the job. When I informed them that I would be taking a business trip to Chicago the following week Bob Vecchio called me the next day on a Sunday with the estimate. We discussed my preferences which included replacing the deck boards and removing the bench. This call was followed up by a written estimate of everything we discussed and ...

The serviceman were polite but had arrived quite a bit later than I had anticipated. They were able to reset it immediately but when it restarted, the vibration apparently caused a stress crack on the fitting, and it began to leak. So, they did...

The price was comparable to others from whom we requested quotes. When I asked for an estimate in writing, the owner refused stating that they were busy and his oral estimate was firm. We declined his offer because we do not do business without a written agre...

The water-damaged ceiling, stubborn wallpaper border, and dirty laminate counters were taken down. Recessed, track, and under-counter lighting, solid-surface counters, floor, and backsplash went in. Much prep work ensued before many coats of paint could go on ceiling, walls, and trim....

They even did a side of the house I had wanted to do originally but decided to wait on to save money; they just included that as a good gesture because they were there. I had been unclear about how I wanted the side doorstep cemented, and when I called Bob after his workers had left, without hesitation he sent someone bac...

Therefore, he had to come back the following evening with a bigger snake. We were a bit unhappy at what seemed to be a lack of communication between the plumber and the company. In spite of this, we were very pleased with the plumber. He arrived when he sa...

5,Old gutters were removed. New seamless gutters were installed. Great job. They were swift and professional.
5,Work was completed when they said it would be completed and the quality of the work was exceptional. All workers were very friendly and helpful.
5,"It went very well, a very simple repair and the 2 guys they sent out were very polite and even took closer looks at the porch to make sure nothing else was wrong. Reattached the face board and that was it; almost too easy."
5,It went great! I called Mr. Bob Vecchio and told him what the problem was and he sent the plumber to my home the same day. The problem was fixed that same day. Mr Vecchio told me that the plumber would arrive at my home between 3:00-4:00 PM and the plumber arrived promptly at 3:00 PM.
1,"They never really set up a time to come out. They just showed up one day and started working. It took them 6 months to complete. They accused the weather and scheduling conflicts. The would come in one day, do a few windows, leave, and then not return for months. I argued with him about the price since it was higher than what he had quoted. The finally billed I received was not detailed and didn't...

5,"We heard about the housecleaning service and were getting frustrated with our existing service. We checked about scheduling and flexibility regarding supplies (chemical sensitivities). We liked what we heard and tried them. We've worked with them for two years, still love the service we get from them, and increased the number of days we use them."
5,They did a great job on the caulking and solved the leak problem. Window was completely dry after recent heavy rain. Bob was very responsive and helpful to my initial email. He called me about 5 minutes after I sent him email! They did good work at a great price! I would not hesitate to call them again for just about any repairs.
5,She is the best cleaner I have ever encountered. She had very reasonable prices and did remarkable work. I will absolutely use her again. I did not have to tell her what to do. She told me what needed to be done and went right to work. It was wonderful.
5,Ask for a quote. They returned a call quickly. After saying it was beyond or budget they reduced the cost by 14% to meet our budget. They moved up the original work date to accommodate our situation. They work was done very professionally and completed it in a timely manner. My Wife and I were happy with the results.
5,Project went as planned. Done in a timely and expedient fashion.
5,"He arrived on time, took his shoes off without being asked to, worked quickly and cleaned up when done. Overall, he did an excellent job!"
5,The work was efficient and well done. They were very courteous. I would have liked a bit more clean-up but I am very anal about that sort of thing!
5,They were very friendly and conscientious about their work. We would use them again if needed.
5,"Electrician took only about 90 minutes to drill a hole in the wall, run wire, and install a working outlet. He was very efficient and borrowed my broom and dust pan to clean up. The outlet looks like it was always there!"
5,GREAT! I called Mr. Vecchio and explained to him the problem I was having and the crew came the same week and fixed the problem.
5,"They were considerate, polite, easy to work with."
5,"Denean is friendly, easy to talk to, follows directions and asks questions if she doesn't understand. She brings her own supplies but also asks what you like. She will stay as long as she needs to in order to complete the job. She calls the day before and arrives in a timely fashion."
5,"The crew re-pitched the wrong gutter the first time out, apparently it was worse than the one I had identified. They came out a second time and took care of the second one for an additional charge."
5,They did an excellent job. I've already recommended them to family members. They do great work!
5,I called The House Doctors in early winter and had an estimate within a few days. Bob called a few days before the work was to be done. Everything went well and the cables work just fine. I was promptly billed for the agreed upon amount. I will have them back to do more work.
1,"I called and spoke with Mr. Vecchio who told me that his son would call that evening to arrange to come by for an estimate. The son did not call me until the next day. We then arranged a time for him to come by and make an estimate. The minutes after the two hour window during which Mike Vecchio was supposed to come by, he called to say that he would not be able to make it. He then arranged anothe...

4,"We were selling a house that we had lived in and done the work on for the last 13 years. It was pretty good work, but there were some things we thought were just ok. If one of us had been there while the work was being done, it probably would have been more up to our standards."
5,"We had worked with Bob Vecchio before and were very pleased. He was very responsive to our request for installation of this floor and 3 light fixtures in the 2 weeks before Thanksgiving company was arriving. His contractor was prompt on the day scheduled and completed the job that day, cleaning the area thoroughly. The entire job turned out costing more than I had anticipated and Bob was quite res...

5,"Bob Vecchio was very responsive to our request for several small jobs in the 2 weeks before Thanksgiving. His electrical contractor called promptly, and scheduled at a time that was convenient for us. He installed all 3 fixtures and the outlet in under an hour, and cleaned up the areas thoroughly."
2,"After electrician came to estimate the work I waited ten days before getting a call with a price. I agreed to the work and was told it would begin in a week. There was no written estimate, and no contract. After several calls, the work was begun roughly two months after promised, but then as an afterthought. The electrician came mid-Saturday morning to begin, but had not brought the cement to set ...

Mr. Karpi called Kohler and had the piece sent to him. I had to call P...

5,They did a good job figuring out how to achieve this in an old home (1916). It was a messy job - their clean up was adequate.
5,"Job 1: Nice men, communicated very well as the scope of the project changed, cleaned up debris and was a pleasure to work with. Job 2: For a cooler, winter day, the workman is excellent. He was thorough but quick and did an excellent job."
5,"Excellent. The workman (Jim) is friendly, thorough and an excellent handyman. They came when they said they would and were done in a few hours. I wouldn't use anyone else."
5,Work was done very neatly and carefully. Accommodated my very tight schedule. I decided to paint at the least minute before having rugs put in. They cut back the old rugs for me to make sure that the baseboard trim would be fully painted. Everything was done very well and according to the schedule promised.
5,"They are very trustworthy and reliable. Always very nice to work with, they always take care of work that needs to be addressed right away and promptly return to finish up on the smaller things. Great to work with! I would highly recommend this company to anyone. THESE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING!"

4,We didn't hire Bob but I appreciated his responsiveness.

Rob arrived when he promised, worked quickly, cleaned up nicely and everything worked when he finished. Bob was friendly and professional. We should have gotten an estimate before hiring the company. We were very surprised by the price when our bill came. I would hire again, but only after ge...

They arranged to do the job and sent an exterior painting crew who did a good-enough job but left piles of garbage, paint chips, broken wood, etc. in my yard.

2,Very poor. See my description above.
5,"The House Doctors do an excellent job. Bob goes over everything and makes sure that I am happy with the work, and will make any adjustments that I ask. The workmen always call and let me know when to expect them. I am very pleased with the work they do."
5,"There were absolutely no glitches at all. We had a specific budget we needed to work with and they were willing to break down the cost of everything we needed done so if we had to, we could elect to do things piecemeal. There were no surprises at all. I was glad I chose the paint color that Don suggested because if I had gone with my original choice, it would have been too dark. Don't walk to the ...

5,"It was quick, painless and reassuring."
5,"The appointment was easy to make. The fellow who did the work was friendly, and showed up on time. I feel stupid that the fix was so simple, but that's hardly their fault. The price charged was simply the fee for a house call, they did not charge me for the new screws."
5,I called Saturday and the job was done Monday by the time I got home from work. A message was also left explaining the work done and repairs that were made. Excellent customer service. I was very impressed by the promptness of the job.
5,"Everything went very smooth. Bob called me back in a timely manner, we discussed the work I needed done. He came by the next day (he was in the neighborhood and dropped by) to take a look at everything in person, to make sure he understood everything. He told me they would come out the next week, and they did, calling first to make sure I would be home and that it was OK to come over. They worked ...

5,The stucco was repaired the day I called. The other work was done promptly as well.
5,I called and they came out and gave me an estimate within a few days. He was very nice and explained what needed to be done without talking over my head. He was honest and didn't try to scare me into getting work done that I didn't need (which other folks tried to do.) The work was done quickly and professionally. Our steps look great! I can't say enough good things about Bob. He is a gem!
5,"I was pleased with the work done. The company arrived when they said they would, worked consistently and bagged up all trash when they left."
5,I have used them before and they are great! I found them through Angie's List. I would definitely hire them again!
1,"I called this company for an estimate. They did return my initial call, however I never heard back. They did finally call back and asked if I wanted the estimate and declined the offer. I found someone else to do the work."
5,Rod Patterson came promptly. He addressed the problems with no delay. He worked efficiently. He only took 45 minutes for the entire job. It went fine! I was very happy with him!
5,"We wanted this job done quickly, so they came out late at night to give us an estimate and then were able to do the job the next day. They called part-way through the day and suggested that they re-trim the door to match the other doorway in the room. It meant the cost of the job went up, but I think they were right. They did an excellent job of matching the existing doorway (hard to do in a 90 ye...

5,"Bob was very prompt in giving us a quote. It took a couple weeks for them to get to the job, but we told them it was not urgent and since it was an outside job and nobody needed to be home, it really didn't matter. When the job was done, it was done in a day with no hassle. Gutters look great and I thought the price was very reasonable for the work."
5,"Rod was professional and friendly. He came on time and completed the job in a timely manner. He did an excellent job. We are very happy with Rod and with Robert J. Vecchio who is the owner of The House Doctors. Bob always returned my calls quickly, was always very helpful and accommodating. He gave me advice on what kind of fixture would best suit our needs."
5,"Jim was professional and friendly. He completed the job in one day, covered the floor with cloths to protect them and then cleaned up when he was finished. He did an excellent job. We are very happy with Jim and with Robert J. Vecchio who is the owner of The House Doctors. Bob always returned my calls quickly, was always very helpful and accommodating."
5,"It took them a couple of weeks to get to the job, but we told them it wasn't urgent and actually had them do another indoor job in the meantime. When they did the job, it was done in one day with no hassle. I don't know if the repairs they did fixed the leak as the leak was quite small, really more of a moisture issue, but everything looks great."
5,"Michael and Jim were very professional. They came on time and completed the job in a timely manner. They did an excellent job and we are very happy with their work. Robert J. Vecchio, owner of The House Doctors, always returned my calls quickly and was always very helpful and accommodating."

They did come on the second agreed upon day on time and ready to work. Work was accomplished well and in cooperation with plumber replacing corroded gas line from water leak.

5,"The quality of the work was great. Several of the brick on the bottom step were missing and the side of the steps looked like they be falling over. Now I can't even tell where the problem was. I did have to call back to confirm that the work was going to be done, but to be fair I was told that there were several other jobs being worked on before mine."
5,"We were working against a deadline set by an insurance company and I had mistakenly thought we had more time than we actually did. Bob and his electrician, Rod, went above and beyond the call of duty to get the job done. Bob also spent extra time and effort to provide the insurance company with documents on very short notice so our policy would not be canceled! Even though it was my error with the...

Bob was very responsive to my concerns about the proper prep work needed on our job. The exterior had been neglected and the paint badly chipped.

5,"I did not get warranty in writing. The technician did not give me a free estimate, did not quote the price, and did not provide with a paperwork. He did the job quick, though, took him about five minutes tops. Later I called the company owner and inquired about the warranty. His response was that if they did something wrong, they would come back and fix it, which was very vague as far as I am conc...

Also they had to come back to do baseboard work inside a closet that was missed the first time out...

All of the gutters and downspouts were cleaned and two of the thresholds were removed & replaced. I would definitely call them again."
3,"I never got a quote, nobody ever came out. I decided to go with another company."
1,I received a call back from the company and gave them my address and explained the nature of the work and was promised I would receive an estimate. I never received the estimate.
5,Every time there was lots of rain the gutter gushed water and went through the bricks into basement. I called Bob and told him my problem and I thought they could just glue it together and he said he didn't think so because it wouldn't hold. I went and ran an errand and came home and the job was complete. Yahoo! You couldn't get better service than The House Doctors

Bob is always quick to respond, and Rod (who has been here before) is friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable. He's never failed to diagnose and fix my electrical problems. This time was no exception."
2,"Did not select contractor, too expensive."
1,"I thought his prices were too high for what he did. He unrolled the blinds and just hooked them on a nail. Other than price, he was alright!"
5,I would give them an A++ if I could. They were timely and did not require a contract. I can't stop saying good things about the service.
5,"Excellent. I used them for house painting, but will use them for other services, too."

5,Went well. The company negotiated the price with my insurance company so that I only was responsible for the deductible. There were a few problems with the plumb line bleeding through the ceiling. Mike returned twice to fix this and it turned out well. He returned my calls right away and made arrangements to fix the problems.

Mr. Vecchio returned my call in a timely manner and a scheduled appointment was made with one of his workers shortly thereafter.

2,"We sought out the House Doctors. They submitted a bid, but, despite telling us they would give us references and multiple phone calls, we never received any references or anyplace to go to see recent work. I finally got tired of making unanswered phone calls, gave up and went with another contractor."

5,"I emailed Bob for an estimate and got 3 other estimates. He consistently is the most responsive. He gave me an estimate, I left the country for a month, and contacted him to get the work done. Within a week the process was going. His workmen are consistent, pleasant and competent. A pleasure to work with."
4,"Quick, aggressive return of my phone message. Was ready to come do the job almost immediately and seemed to run right past request for an estimate. When I asked how much the job would cost, he said he would be surprised if it exceeded $100, including installing, mortaring vent piece.

5,"They came quickly, came in and saw what I wanted and they summed it up. The next day they came in with the carpentry work already done and painted and ready for installation. They were fast, efficient and clean."
5,Very well. They were very prompt with coming out to see the damage and providing an estimate. They also viewed all other gutters to see if any other replacements were needed. The work was done within the time estimate they had provided me and within the cost they had estimated the job. I was very pleased with the work they had provided and would use them again.
5,"They came out the same day that I called, at the time promised. The worker evaluated that old pipes needed replaced from kitchen sink, went to buy PVC piping, then returned and replaced in a timely manner. He then snaked out the bathroom sink and completed everything within about 2 hours."
5,"Called for estimate. Received estimate and work was performed in less than a week. All debris was removed and landscaping was not damaged with work from above (as was the case with other gutter cleaners). I was very pleased with the quality of their work, their timeliness and their professionalism. I will definitely use them again."

Would definitely use again."

I didn't have to keep calling to follow up, he did the contact & statusing. Rod did the work, the job took roughly 3 hours for EVERYTHING. The guy ""hustled"", he knew what needed to be done & went right to it. Once again, we h...

5,"I called Bob Vecchio and the next day he had a quote for me on all three projects. Since these were city violation there was an impending deadline. I had waited too long to get the projects going, so I put Bob in a tight schedule. Much to my surprise, they still got all three projects completed before the deadline. The crew also ended up replacing more bricks in the steps than the original estimat...

1,"The paint dripped on the brick and landscape. He did the job in Oct and the paint is flaking off, in big sheets. They painted in the rain."
5,"We received a return call from Mike almost immediately, who arranged for some of the outside work to be completed while my husband and I were away for a week. When we returned home the painting had all been complete. From there, over the course of a week, the remaining tasks were finished. All of the guys were very prompt and courteous, and I especially enjoyed Mike's honesty and ability to work w...

5,"Very well. Bob gave me several options for completing the job. They did it quickly and hauled everything away. There was no mess to clean up. I never even knew they were there, except that all of the debris was taken away. It was expensive, but this was a job that was too big for me to do on my own."
5,"Bob furnished an estimate, within a day or two of our initial phone call. Work was performed excellently, and clean up was complete. He was pleasant and professional, in all interactions."
1,It is now 5/31/07 and I still have not heard from him.
4,Company failed to replace the wood with fascia board as promised. Company eventually acknowledged mistake and reduced the cost of the repair.
4,My toilet was leaking and I did not know why plus I needed an old floor pulled up so I could install a new floor. I called Bob Vecchio and he assured me he would have it taken care of and he did. It is hard to rate the price because I have nothing to compare it to.
4,Sent subcontractor to do work which took about 1 1/2 hours.
5,They answered my call very promptly. Very satisfactory. Professional and did the repairs quickly. I expected a little better of a repair on the gate and it was a little expensive.
5,"We asked for an estimate on tuckpointing and repairing some brickwork that had been messed up by a previous contractor. Mike arrived promptly and, after reviewing the situation, advised us to leave it alone or replace the whole steps (which would be very expensive.) He was honest and open about the work and I appreciated that."
4,"It took them an hour. They did a good job, but the charge was excessive."
5,"Returned calls promptly and gave us an estimate for painting and gutters. We just went with them for the gutters (got better painting prices elsewhere), but their price was great and work was done promptly and neatly."
5,They were very trustworthy and respectful.
5,"Spoke with owner on the - single phone call. Described work I thought needed to be done. He immediately sent out someone to do a free estimate and called me back within a day or two. I agreed to have the work done. Despite nasty weather, work was done ahead of schedule. Workers completed job during the day. Good clean up. Bill arrived a few days later and the did not exceed their estimate, in fact...

He runs an amazing business with a great reputation on Angie's List and in the community that I work and live. All work was done as promised. Extremely professional and done correctly. I even purchased the wrong light switch and the electrician came out the following day at no cha...

5,"I called The House Doctors on a Sunday (February 2007) and the call was returned within an hour. A plumber met me at my rental unit the very next day to assess the problem and the work was started the day after that. After the first job was completed, I hired them again to repair the main stack (March 2007)and then hired them a third time for the kitchen plumbing (March 2007). The plumber was very...

5,"I called and spoke to Bob Vecchio and it was just as easy as that. I explained about the gutter and TV antenna and he said that someone would be out to do the work either that day or the next. There was no complaining about the job being too small. I came home from work the next day and the job was done, and the invoice was in my mailbox. Simple as that."
5,"While this was going on we had heavy winter weather that brought down outdoor wiring and froze up my back porch so I couldn't open the back door. Bob had the electrician fix the wiring, and install a special heating mat that melted the snow blocking the door so that I could get out. I am happy with the work that they do, and pleased with the nice people that do the work, especially the pleasant an...

4,"The response was a little slow. I do realize it's a busy season, but it would be nice to know when they were going to come."
5,They are great guys who take pride in their work. They cleaned all the gutters and helped out with a few other items that needed to be fixed around the house. They are respectful and responsive guys who take good care of their customers.
5,"Bob Vecchio returned my call the same day, and we scheduled an appointment for Rod to come over. Rod arrived about 15 minutes early and finished the entire job in about 45 minutes. Both Bob V. & Rod were very friendly and nice to talk to."
1,"Bob returned my initial call promptly, and was helpful and professional on the phone. The pipes through a crawl space leading to my kitchen had frozen during the cold snap this winter, and I called for help getting them unfrozen. It turned out that The House Doctors also do many of the other things I need done around the house, so I was looking forward to developing a professional relationship. I ...

5,The process was very efficient. Bob Vecchio called me back when I left a message about an estimate and they performed the work quickly.
5,Bob responded quickly when it started raining in our kitchen! His crew worked fast to find the source of the bathroom leak. We know we can count on the House Doctors!
5,"The House Doctors built a screened-in porch over part of our existing deck. Bob and his carpenters talked with us and helped us define and refine our vision; and the finished porch is better than we ever imagined! The expert carpenters sped through the job. Bob had our total satisfaction as his highest priority, and we are thrilled with our new living space!"
5,"We went from drab to fab when the House Doctors painted our house. The painters were great, fast and neat; and Bob checked daily to make sure we were happy with the job. Our sad, gray eyesore is now the cheeriest house on the block!"
5,He came right away. It was excellent work.
4,"Originally expected work to take about a week, but unexpected surprises and commitments to other customers made it take almost three weeks."
5,"I called Bob and he arranged to have someone meet me at the house the next day for an estimate. The work took several days, due to the number of violations. I left a key with one of the workers, who met me after the work was complete to show me the repairs. They were very prompt and professional."
5,"I left Bob a message, he called me with in 24 hours. He did the estimate and gave me a date. Because of the weather the date had to be changed. He called me right away to let me know the situation and gave a reschedule date. The workers came out did a great job, cleaned up, and I was invoiced with no surprises."
5,"The House Doctors sent a plumber Robert who did a great job. We have made a laundry room off a bathroom in our house, and when the tub drains, it backs up into the bathroom sink. Over time, the amount of back up increases so that we need to have it snaked. Robert was able to snake it out so well that it doesn't back up at all anymore (this has never happened before). Robert also unclogged a baseme...

5,"Overall, very good work. Initial contact was prompt, estimate within a couple of days. Actual work itself was excellent. Absolutely no sign of original damage. However, I do feel the price was a little high for the work done."
4,They arrived at the time agreed to. They worked steadily until the job was done. They cleaned up appropriately. Overall the job went well.
5,They cleaned the gutters and the porches and removed all the debris.
4,"The House Doctors are the most responsive and understanding contractors I have ever dealt with, and the job's end result was good. However, their estimate was higher than that estimated by the insurance company, and the insurance company's estimate covered work that was never completed by the contractor (new wainscoting vs. reusing old, painting walls and ceiling, sanding and re staining floors). ...

I am very happy with the work they did. Bob got back to me the day I left the message requesting them cleaned. I was put on the list. The good thing was all the leaves had fallen off by the time it was my turn...

5,"Michael was a pleasure to work with. He responded to my calls quickly, told us what our choices were to repair the damage, completed the work in a timely fashion, and then followed up with a phone call to make sure we were pleased. We were very happy with the work performed. We have used The House Doctors before and would again."
5,"Michael was able to come out and repair the hole and texture it to match within a few days of our initial call. We appreciated the quick turnaround, and it looks good. In addition, we always appreciate it when contractors remove their shoes at the front door without being asked, which Michael and the other gentleman did. Little things like this go a long way with us. We would hire again."
5,Bob Vechhio does a lot of work around my house and came quickly to put flapping siding back in place. The workers were extremely polite as always.
5,Fine. Except that it took three weeks for the electrician to call. This was acceptable since this was not a high priority project. I will call The House Doctor's again the next time I need them.
5,"After I got the notice from CEI of the problem to be corrected, I called Bob Vecchio of the House Doctors and left a message. He called me back within a couple of hours, determined the problem and work to be done, and (since it wasn't an emergency) said Rod (his electrician) would be out in two days. Despite the bad weather that day (including dangerously high winds), Rod came, climbed up on a lad...

Along the way, changes were made and more holes were dug-some by hand, some by machine. There were jack hammers in my basement. Dye was poured through the drainage system and a few more leaks were found and fixed. The job was constantly monitored by the managers and the workers w...

5,"I had some problems with the toilet after they left, with the water running, I called and they came right out and notice that the replacement was defective so he fixed it. I thought the price was very reasonable. I am already using the company again. I highly recommend them."
4,"Electrician came to the house to get the data, with which to make an estimate. I accepted the estimate. They scheduled an installation time, but postponed it with a phone call. Scheduled a new date. Arrived and worked to the end of the day. Came back later to finish. That was no problem, because of the uncritical nature of the work. Uncritical, unless heavy snow would have fallen."
5,"Replied immediately to my call and I had an estimate the next day. The work was completed that week and they took care to set aside some name plaques so that I could return them. The site was cleaned up, dirt hauled away to the spot I indicated, grass repaired and the mailboxes wiped down. Great job."
5,"Call made to get a number of small items done...this was the first. Electrician arrived on time, and knew exactly what needed to be done. Took boots off at front door, installed light fixture in about 10 minutes then went to work on the sensor issue. Had to get a part, but immediately fixed the problem once that was done."
2,"I had to call a few times to see when they'd come out, problems contacting each other for first 3 weeks was due to phone tag, but then for next month. I was basically waiting for them to come give me estimate and then do work. One mistake I made was not getting written, itemized estimate. First estimate was $995, but price was for only 1 column and not 2 (remainder of work as above). So essentiall...

Eventually came out on a Saturday and did all th...

1,Not good! Agreed to do work (trim tree) & then canceled at last minute!
2,Frustrating - while I received a prompt initial return; no one ever came out for an estimate. I did call again and leave a message but no response. I understand if a business doesn't have time to add new jobs but they should say that up front not just disappear.
5,Very pleased. Prompt. Offered a solution when my original request was not possible. My kitchen light fan didn't work. I thought it was a short. I turned out the light/fan itself was defective.
2,This interaction was three weeks ago and we have yet to hear from them or receive an estimate.
5,"Very well. It was completed faster than I anticipated and with no problems. It was a little expensive, but there were no hassles, so it was worth it."
3,After the lamp was installed there was something wrong with it which the guy from house doctors told my dad it was something he had done. Once my father said he had done nothing to it they guy refused to come back and fix the problem.
2,"I had a problem with them;their responsiveness was horrible. Contacted them on the 23rd of August. They said they'd get back to me and that took until the 28th. They sent somebody out on the 31st. I asked if he wouldn't mind giving me an estimate. I waited until after Labor Day, left a message on the fifth and the sixth. They called back on the sixth and said they would give me the estimate on the...

4,"The work was done reasonably well and promptly. I had hoped to receive an estimate before they did the work, instead, they came to the house and did the job the day after I called. Since I am satisfied with the job, no problem."
3,"We set up an appointment for Tuesday when I got back from running errands, and there was a voice mail on my answering machine saying they could not make it and they left another number, but the message took so long that it cut off the number. I have not heard from them since."
5,Very prompt response to request for quote. Excellent follow-up all the way up to the day the work was completed. Completed within a week after I told them there was no hurry. Cost was the same as quoted.
5,"They are so easy to work with and they are so responsive. I asked Bob Vecchio, who is the owner and I asked his opinion on something where someone else had done the work and he was very responsive and he tried to help me and didn't charge for that. They try to work around my schedule, the customer's schedule and they are really are just incredibly prompt."
5,We hired The House Doctors at the last minute. They were very helpful in getting work started at odd hours until they could get a full crew on. The work got done as quickly as possible with truly first rate results. The crew was very helpful and accommodating to our needs and kept it real clean. House Doctors also dealt well and fairly with additions to the job that we determined as we went along.
5,Electrician Rod Patterson from House Doctors was on site within 24 hours and quickly repaired the problem.
1,He said he would call to make an appointment to see the house but he never called.
2,It's been a week and a half and I still don't have my estimate. Very frustrating to communicate with.
5,The work was completed to my satisfaction.
5,"This was an emergency. I had contacted another contractor who came in and gave me a price, and never showed for the time he was supposed to do the job, and called again for another week, never showed up, and I had moved everything out of my TV room, sofa, TV, everything. When House Doctors came in they got to the job in one day and finished it and I was very, very pleased. Thank you."
4,"I probably would've graded them higher. Their responsiveness was initially good, but I had to contact them again. I'd like to try them again. I think overall they were very good."
5,He showed up quickly and did an excellent job.
3,"The caulking and masonry was completed quickly. The pickets on the fence gate were deteriorated and the gate needed to be re-built to match the rest of the fence. This was not handled well. They tried to complete the job quickly, but they didn't pay any attention to detail. They built a gate that did not match the rest of the fence either in style or length of pickets, and told me later that they ...

First the great part - Michael was very polite, was very considerate of my desire not to inhale paint and finishing fumes while pregnant, and made sure I was happy with the style spindles picked out. The work itself was good, and note that this was a difficult, detailed job. The bad - I was originally told it would take 2 1/2 days to finish and it took 5, and they continuo...

There was no harm done, however, and no inconvenience to me as I did not have to be ho...

The company seems extremely concerned to leave the customer happy with the job and will do what it takes to make that happen. I would hire this company again for other carpentry work on my house."

Mike called me from the house the next day to verify what needed doing and gave me a verbal quote. I gave the go ahead to do the work and it was completed by the end of the next day.

4,"Good. Very professional. The fact that for a high price, contractor had to come back to do a satisfactory job. Keep an eye on finished product. He did only what he thought he needed to do. Break down price so I could pick & choose what I needed & what was ""nice to do""."
5,It is very easy to work with The House Doctors. Their response time is excellent and work began within 24 hours of my initial contact. Workmanship is very good - I had a lot of confidence that the contractor knew what he was doing.
5,"I was very pleased with The House Doctors' response. They reviewed the driveway and advised me as to my options. They advised me not to do as much patching as I had thought because, in their professional view, the patching would not work on various parts of the driveway. The part of the project that they did advise to do went very well."
5,"Robert the plumber was responsive to my calls, on time, polite, and on task the whole time. I thought the price was fair."

1,"I was initially sold on Mr. Vecchio's (senior) attitude and willingness to go above and beyond. He was eager to do a good job, and seemed to take pride in his reputation. Because of this, I was floored by Mike Vecchio's response. This is certainly not the kind of customer service I expected after my initial experience with the company. For a company like this, I would want to save others the aggra...

5,"Bob Vecchio showed up for the estimate on time, he returned phone calls and the workers did a great job with minimal inconvenience to us. I would definitely recommend ''The House Doctors'' and we WILL use the in the future."

Very easy to work with and we woill certainly use them again."
5,Excellent response and a written detailed quote for the work. I will use them when I am ready with the money. They have not yet started the work.
5,They did a good job and they were very prompt. They came out the next day after I called them. I would definitely recommend them.
5,"Very good experience overall. They did good quality work and were responsive. Mike G. did the work and was very easy to work with. Bob took care of everything, accommodating us on the specific fixtures and tile we wanted that had to be special ordered and installed. It took a little longer than expected but we didn't mind because they were so responsive to our needs. They were also very neat and c...

5,"Prompt and professional. I forgot about the appointment and called when I got home to apologize. They came right back out to work on the toilet, which I appreciate!"
5,"We called The House Doctors because they have done a lot of work for us in the past. They always aim to please. Bob Vecchio returned my call the same day. It's nice to know that there is a dependable service out there that is willing to come out and do odd repairs, such as a small hole in the wall that others might not want to bother with."
5,"Working with Mike was a pleasure. I received an estimate and he explained to me everything that would be completed. The roofing was done quickly and the guys were nice enough to take before and after pictures for me. They picked up all the old roofing and left the place very neat. Pat did the work in the bathroom. The door and ceiling look great. He was very thorough. Mike took the time to explain...

5,"Mr Vecchio actually took my call on a Sunday afternoon and came out for an estimate the next week. We agreed on the price and the work was completed in a week. Very professional, prompt and good to work with. Definitely will hire again for my home maintenance."
5,"Mr Vecchio was very prompt, professional, remembered cleaning my gutters six months ago. No damage to landscaping despite many flower beds. Also fixed my downspouts due to broken clay, very good job. Nice to work with, will hire again."
5,"Arrived promptly, was courteous, neat, professional and efficient. Would highly recommend."
5,"This was a small job but it was important to us to get it done well. The work was performed by one person who appeared to be an accomplished mason. The work was done, as contracted, and in a timely manner. Although I had less expensive quotes, I felt comfortable that this company would perform even a small job well. If I paid a premium for that, it was worth it."
5,"Once again, I received stellar service from Bob and his crew. The work was done in a timely and cost-effective manner. It's always a pleasure to work with Bob."
1,"Actually, so far we are disappointed. We were interested in having multiple projects done, including cleaning and re-staining our large deck, and rebuilding our brick front porch. We decided to call the House Doctors because their listing covered our needs best. We left a message with the original call and he called back that same day. We asked him specifically if he came to Lorain county and he s...

5,"The plumber was very courteous, fast and left no mess. We are very happy with the work. There was a slight scheduling mix up, but did not cause any problems."
2,"I called them again, and he told me he was going to charge me $70 just to come out to look at it. That's ridiculous, when 2 months earlier, he had charged $150 to clean them out. That to me was not right."
5,They are very responsive and they do a nice job.
3,"Told me they would come over in a week to take a look at the job, but then stated they were unable to perform the work. Lost one week n clearing contingency of home sale."
5,"Mike Vecchio & his help did an excellent job. I was satisfied with their work. Very prompt, quick, courteous, kept me updated as to what was going on; cleaned up and I will use their services again."
5,"Steps were in bad repair. The guys came out within a few weeks of my initial call & had most of the job completed by the time I came home from work. Work site was very clean & neat, & debris was bagged & placed at the curb for collection. The only fault I could find is that my water was left running when it could have been conserved by using a nozzle shutoff."
5,"The plumber easy to schedule, came on time and was very pleasant."
5,"Well done, and worth the slightly high price."
5,"Our experience with the company was, overall, very positive. After some delay in getting the estimates, the work was completed in a timely fashion. All the contractors were polite, cleaned up, and were, overall, very professional."
5,They came out yesterday. They were very efficient at the work and did a variety of jobs. I would hire them again to come back and do more work.
5,"Working with Bob, Mike and Mike, and Rod has been very easy. They've made preparing our house for sale (what could have been a very difficult time) very simple. When called, they promptly came to see the problems and provided estimates. They worked with my schedule and completed the tasks very quickly. And, they communicated clearly every step of the way - from confirming appointment times to prov...

5,Very good experience overall. Prompt and courteous workers who kept us updated and informed of their progress all along the way. They finished the job much quicker than we expected. Price and quality are a solid B+.
5,"Overall they were very responsive and called back first before the other companies, even on a holiday. They came when they said they would. They were great as far as cleanup afterwards, they covered everything in the kitchen. He washed and mopped everything in my kitchen as well. Also very honest in their assessment. Their pricing was a little higher than I would've liked, but overall it was a gre...

1,"He said someone would call me within a week, but never got one ring. I don't understand. If business is good, just hire more people. Why treat potential customers like this?"
4,He was fine. He put a shelf in the brick to brace the air conditioner.
5,"While preparing my home to be put up for sale, I had a number of projects to complete. Bob and his team of specialists were lifesavers! Bob returned my initial call within 8 hours, and his team was tackling projects within a day. Among the many projects, they fix loose tuck-pointing and repaired several cracks in my garage floor. They were great to work with. I'll be using them again."

Bob returned my initial call within 8 hours, and his team was tackling projects within a day. Among the many projects, they installed several electrical fixtures and 3 GFI outlets. They were very professional. I'll be using them again!"
5,"Bob and Mike were both extremely polite and easy to talk to. They pointed out issues that I should know about. We are still deciding whether to paint or re-side, but I will surely use this company in the future."
4,THEY WERE FINE. THEY WAITED UNTIL I GOT HOME SO I COULD CHECK AND SEE IF THERE WERE ANY PLACES THAT NEEDED TOUCHED UP. THEY STAYED ON SITE UNTIL I GOT HOME.
5,"The returned my call requesting a quote very promptly and set up an appointment for the following week. They arrived on time for the appointment and answered all my questions. They called within a week with a verbal quote and mailed me the quote a day or two later. They then followed up with a call a week later. I would have used this company if I were to paint but have decided to go with vinyl si...

1,They returned my call but never called back for an estimate or to inform me that they were not available to do the job.
5,"They are prompt and professional, and they gave helpful advice."
5,"I am very pleased with the house doctors. They are nice to work with. They did a good job. We did have problems with our toilet after the remodel, and they were very quick to respond and troubleshoot the problem until it was fixed at no extra charge. We plan to use them in the future."
1,I called the company for an estimate for flooring damage over two weeks ago. Bob Vecchio did call me back to say that he would call back to schedule an appointment to assess the damage and I still have not heard back. I called because he received such a high rating and have decided to go with someone else.
5,My husband and I were very impressed by how clean this company left the area when they were finished.
5,"Their work was fine. I did not need to be home when they came out, which was helpful. They left the bill in my mailbox, and Bob called the night they came out to make sure I received the bill and to make sure everything went ok. I was very happy with their work. It did take them a week or so to get to my house, but I think they had many gutter cleaning requests (this was in the middle of the Janua...

5,"When I called The House Doctors, Mr. Vecchio returned my call the same day. He then called back when the weather warmed up and the ice had melted enough to do the necessary gutter repairs. His son, Mr. Mike Vichy, was very polite and knowledgeable and didn't mind that I asked if he could do a few other jobs while he and the crew were at my home. He was able to complete the scheduled work and the e...

4,"THEY REALLY DID A NICE JOB ON THE WALL REPAIR AND THE PAINT. WE ALSO HAD THEM DO A DIFFICULT CARPENTRY JOB, BUT THEY ADMITTED THEY WERE UNABLE TO DO IT, AND REFUNDED US FOR THAT WORK."
5,"Very polite and professional. Was able to get the job done as soon as possible...weather permitting. Left no debris afterwards. Overall, a very good experience."
5,Excellent and very professional. Always cleaned up mess. John Webb and his brother even worked through the weekend to accomplish the work.
5,"This service was extremely responsive. After I spoke with the owner of the company and established my needs, he identified two separate employees who would each perform part of the work. Within a few hours, both of the employees contacted me to set up appointments. They were both very polite and easy to work with."
1,"I contacted them because of favorable comments on Angie's List regarding a total bathroom remodel. I received a call back & described the work, & the individual said he would call back to schedule an appointment for an estimate. A week later, I received a call from the carpenter/plumber. I explained what was involved in the bathroom remodel. He said he would check his calendar & call back. I never...

5,"The company was prompt and did a very professional job without leaving a mess. I had a limited amount of time to get the gutters cleaned, and they were able to squeeze me in quickly. I will use them for other work as well."
5,The crew was very responsive and did a very good job of re-installing the gutter and awning. I was given a price range of $275 to $395 which seemed kind of high but the work needed to be done.
5,"I am very pleased with the work done for me by Bob Vecchio and his crew. I have had them do several jobs for me, large and small, and they have always been thorough, professional, and helpful. Bob takes a personal interest in doing a good job, and has even suggested not doing some things."
5,"Excellent work. Always reliable. I never have to worry about workmen not showing up. Very responsive. You can contact him by phone or the internet, which is very useful. He has done a variety of jobs, including painting, tuck pointing, plumbing, putting in a ceiling fan in a bathroom. Most recent work was the kitchen painting and fixing cabinets doors, fixing and painting the ceiling. The cost for...

4,"They were very nice to work with and did a good job, but their pricing is on the high side. This job took less than 20 minutes. Also, their arrival estimate is a little unreliable. I was told to expect them between 1 and 5 p.m. They showed up at 11:30 a.m."
5,"This particular time, the House Doctors came to look at the gutters and check on work done previously. The amazing thing about the House Doctors is that they can do or give advice on anything I have asked about my house. They have fixed a leaking basement, installed glass block windows, built a deck, a mud room, installed fans and electrical lights, painted and roofed. When I asked about garage do...

5,"HE WAS REALLY NICE. I CALLED HIM LAST MINUTE AND HE HAD SOMEONE OUT IN A COUPLE DAYS. HE SENT SOMEONE OUT TO FIX SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT DONE RIGHT. THEY DID A NICE JOB AND HELPED ME OUT. THEY CLEANED UP AND HAD EVERYTHING AVAILABLE. HE WAS REALLY FAST, HE GOT A LOT DONE IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME."
5,"BOB WAS VERY QUICK TO RESPOND, GIVE A QUOTE AND HAVE THE CREW OUT TO DO THE WORK. THEY WERE ABLE TO GET ME ON THE SCHEDULE QUICKLY AND WERE VERY INEXPENSIVE. EVERYONE WAS VERY FRIENDLY. MAY LOOK TO HIRE THEM IN FUTURE FOR OTHER JOBS."

5,BOB HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR SLIGHTLY NEGLECTED HOME. HE IS ABLE TO DETERMINE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND TO ENSURE THAT IT IS TAKEN CARE OF TO HIS (AND MY) SATISFACTION.

THEY EXPLAINED WHAT WOULD BE DONE, PROVIDED GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS AND DID A FEW THINGS THAT WERE NOT IN THE QUOTE, (SUCH AS RE-GROUTING SOME OF THE TILES THAT DID NOT REQUIRE REPLACING). I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THEIR WORK AND WOULD USE THEM AGAIN."
5,MOST COMPANIES WOULD HAVE JUST LAID FLOOR UPON FLOOR AND THEY WERE GREAT AT REMOVING ALL UNDERNEATH. THEY DID AN EXCELLENT JOB. PROMPT AND PROFESSIONAL. PEOPLE WOULD HAD COME BEFORE INSTALLED TWO LAYERS OF FLOOR ON TOP OF THE OLD AND THIS COMPANY CORRECTED IT.

5,"VERY COURTEOUS, PROMPT AND RESPONSIVE. WHEN THE WEATHER INTERFERED WITH THE OUTCOME OF ONE PAINTING JOB THEY CAME BACK OUT AND REDID IT. I WAS VERY SATISFIED"

5,HE MADE AN HOUSE CALL THAT HE DID NOT CHARGE ME FOR. HE COULD NOT REPAIR THE SCREENS BECAUSE OF THE SET UP. MR. VECCHIO WAS KIND ENOUGH TO CALL ANOTHER COMPANY THAT COULD DO THE WORK FOR ME. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIS PROFESSIONALISM. IF I EVER NEED ANY WORK DONE THAT HE CAN HELP ME WITH I WILL CALL HIM FIRST.
4,"I WOULD NOT USE THEM AGAIN FOR PAINTING. I NEVER RECEIVED A WRITTEN ESTIMATE. I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE HE EVEN GAVE ME A 10% ANGIE'S LIST DISCOUNT. THE OWNER IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SATISFACTION.

IN ADDITION I HAD...

5,"THEY COULD NOT DO THE WORK DUE TO MY GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION BUT TREATED ME WITH CLASS AND PROFESSIONALISM. THEY TRIED TO LOCATE OTHER CONTRACTORS WHO COULD DO THE WORK AND GAVE ME SOME OTHER PRACTICAL ADVICE. THEY WERE VERY RESPONSIVE. IF HOW THEY TREATED ME IS ANY EVIDENCE OF THE QUALITY OF THEIR WORK, THEY MUST BE EXCELLENT CONTRACTORS."
5,"THEIR PRICE SEEMED HIGH, BUT THEY WERE AT MY HOUSE FOR 4 1/2 HOURS AND I DON''T HAVE ANYBODY TO COMPARE THEM WITH."
5,VERY THOROUGH. OWNER KEPT CHECKING TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS GOING OKAY. THE WORK WAS COMPLETE IN LESS THAN A WEEK.

5,"American Home Improvement gave me a beautiful kitchen and bathroom. Everything from plumping, electric, and asbestos removal was performed professional and timely. The price was fully discussed and agreed on, there were no surprises. My project manager Shawn walked me through each step, keeping me up to date on everything. Great experience!"
5,"They did my kitchen last month. David was the one that did the design, based on my instructions. I put quartz in the kitchen and at the bar. Amazingly cut and finished. They are a bit pricey but the quality is great. I have an open concept design and I've received a lot of compliments for my kitchen. I would recommend them to anyone that has the budget to invest in quality cabinets. They also did my bar."
5,American Home Improvement is a very good remodeling company. They fixed my issue with the kitchen in no time at all. The people from there was very nice and polite when working and did everything with caution as to not cause any problems when working. I liked their work ethics and I recommend them to you too!
5,AHI did a phenomenal remodel of my kitchen. They were professional throughout the whole project and answered all questions I had. End result was just as I expected and nothing less than what they had promised. Really happy and impressed with their work. Thanks a lot! I highly recommend this company!
5,My kitchen design is much better than before thanks to team AHI. Their team is very professional and able to imply the design I had told them at a great accuracy! Super friendly people and very good customer service. It was a pleasure doing business with them!
5,"I had American Home Improvement Inc to renovate my washroom. From the beginning of the job we felt completely comfortable with AHI crew. They were on time, courteous and professional. I will definitely use them soon for my next reno!"
5,"We are very pleased with how our kitchen has turned out. David had great ideas and suggestions on design, and helped us pull the whole look together. All the work was done in a very professional manner, and has a high quality, and clean look. All the contractors involved in our reno were extremely hard working and friendly. American Home Improvement Inc installed our cabinets, and worked long hours, and were happy to help with any of our requests. They took care of every little detail."
5,"We just completed a bathroom remodel with Jack Mair of American Home Improvement. From start to finish, the entire experience was fantastic. Jack communicated with us consistently and was very patient when there were COVID shipping delays. Every specialist that came to our home was excellent, and they were especially responsive in fixing final details like slightly crooked shelves and grout.  I would definitely work with the company again, especially Jack."
5,"I had the pleasure of working with Ben at AHI for a bathroom renovation and change of bedroom flooring in my condo.  My unit was built in 2001, and it was screaming, ""Outdated!""  Ben presented some ideas that upgraded my unit to present time.  He worked around my budget and was able to improvise when needed.  The team that Ben put together for my projects was AMAZING!!  Felix's team handled my flooring, and I absolutely love it!!  Jose and Romeo created the bathroom of my dreams.  Julian completed my dream bathroom with a custom shower door.  The quality and beauty of a custom shower door from Julian will make you frown upon any other kind of shower door... it's a game changer.  All teams were respectful of my unit by being extra clean and noise-conscious when removing the prior flooring and demolishing the bathroom.  Everyone working on my projects was detail-oriented, diligent and stayed on track with the projected date of completion.  Ben visited my unit regularly to monitor the progress of the projects.  He also assisted with answering any questions that the HOA had.  All in all, my experience with AHI was extremely positive.  Everything is beautiful - the outcome exceeds my expectations!  In addition, everything was completed within budget and on time.  Looking forward to reaching out to Ben again for my next project."
5,We renovated our whole kitchen with AHI. It turned out very good and looks great! They had to come back and fix a few things which they did willingly and quickly. We're really pleased with it and would definitely recommend.
5,"I have had a kitchen designed and installed and recently had a bathroom designed and installed by American Home Improvement. This company comes highly recommended, as they are professional and provide high quality products with reasonable pricing. What sets them apart in my opinion is the after sales service. Once your project is complete they don't disappear, as if you have deficiencies they will go above and beyond to make it right. I have dealt with Sam on both projects and he was great, not pushy and provided great insight into the designs. I recently recommended AHI to friends and they got their kitchen installed and were pleased with the entire process. First class company and a delight to deal with!"
5,"American Home Improvement Inc came highly recommended from a friend & they did not disappoint. It was such a pleasure dealing with David & the whole staff at AHI. They went above and beyond & provided amazing customer service regardless of how small the detail was. AHI is one of a kind & we will definitely work with them in the future. Thanks again! We love our home away from home kitchen,"
5,"We are absolutely thrilled with our new kitchen!! David was amazing with the design, planning and implementation of the project. All their staff beginning with Shawn and his team in the construction phase right through to all of the installers were prompt and professional and addressed everything we asked of them. I have heard so many horror stories from others during their kitchen renovations but with American Home Improvement Inc there was absolutely no worries, delays or excuses. Every promise they made was granted and we love the end result!!! I would recommend American Home Improvement Inc to all my friends and family with no hesitation. Thanks David and everyone that played a part in this."
5,"We had a wonderful experience with American Home Improvement Inc and our painters! He responded and came out right away and answered all of our questions. All the painters were very professional and friendly. Our family of  5 was at home working and attending virtual school, and everyone was very respectful and safe coming into the home. And now our house looks so beautiful! I would absolutely recommend them and use them again in the future."
5,David and his entire team created an amazing kitchen. Sam was always around for advice. Installers were very professional. He was always keeping us updated our order. We are now getting built in for the family room made and built in for the bedroom. If you want quality work at a fair price this is the place to go to. American Home Improvement Inc went above and beyond to assist us.
5,It was a pleasure doing business with American Home Improvement Inc. David and his team ran into some unusual challenges with our job but finished the work and made things right. After receiving several quotes for the job - I could tell that this company were true experts in what they do. Thank you to David and American Home Improvement Inc crew!
5,They did amazing work. Staff was very friendly and skilled. I will tell everyone I know about them and will use them again in the future.

5,"These guys are as pro as they come. They were awesome. Their work was skilled, clean and they took their time to ensure everything was done perfectly. They were a pleasure to have around and did a fantastic job. Would hire again in a pinch."
5,"David and Sam did an amazing job on 2 bathrooms for us. They protected our floors and left a clean worksite every evening. You select your vanity, tiles & accessories and Sam does the rest, picking up everything and making sure you are happy throughout the job.
David is a wizard in all aspects of the reno. They all go above and beyond and I look forward to using American Home Improvement Inc again."

5,David and his team were amazing! Showed up early and worked through until the job was done! Knowledgeable and took the time to make sure we were satisfied with the job. Professional!
5,American Home Improvement is a very good remodeling company. They work very fast and with accuracy. They are very polite and very professional.
5,"Booking AHI for painting was very quick, they give a quota and you send them a deposit and book a date and colors. It took 2 days to paint 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, living rooms and closets and it looks like a new condo after painting. I highly recommend them!"
5,"Excellent work painting my entire condo including the kitchen ceiling, inside closets, all doors, trim and baseboards. The painters were courteous and very accommodating. I would definitely recommend Home American Home Improvement Inc."
5,We called AHI in to help us fix up our house - there was minor work on the second floor. Problems have been resolved quickly and efficiently.
5,My wife and I could not have been more pleased with the work completed by American Home Improvement Inc. Project manager provided splendid service from start to finish and administration of our account was professional and courteous. I'll have no hesitation in recommending them to friends and family!
5,Great company. On time and on budget. They take tremendous pride in their work and stop at nothing to get it done properly. Wouldn't look any further for Reno guys. This is the company to use.
5,"We are so happy with our Reno from American Home Improvement Inc. They were quick, clean and friendly and our project manager Josh went above and beyond to complete our Reno. We would highly recommend them if you are looking for a high quality basement renovation!"
5,"David and his team at American Home Improvement renovated my entire basement last summer and did a fantastic job. I recently called American Home Improvement to explain a minor leak that I noticed underneath my laundry sink and a crack in the drywall. They were both fixed right away. This is what I appreciate about them, their promise and delivery in ensuring that their customers are completely satisfied. David  el is a man of his word and I say with confidence through my own experience that he will continue to treat you as his customer even after the project is completed."
5,"They did a complete overhaul of our guest bathroom. from the time they submitted the original quote until the project was complete they provided quality service, and genuine assistance. answered all of our questions quickly, and delivered a perfect outcome. Would use them again."
5,American Home Improvement Inc delivered on quality of the work and the promise time of 3 weeks completion was kept. They were professional and easy to work with. The project manager David took it personal to ensure customer satisfaction. The architectural and technical planning was collaborative and each we were kept up to date as the land unfolded. It is important for anyone using this company to do your own research on prices as they are a bit pricey. Overall they worked well and on schedule.
5,American Home Improvement Inc just finished our basement renovation and we are very pleased with the results. We chose them due to their reputation for high quality and being under budget. Ben was very knowledgeable and professional and he was always available to answer questions. He managed the various contractors and got the project finished on time. We would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone.
5,"David was an excellent project manager. He was up front, honest and accurate with everything that he told us."
5,"With my overall vision to guide them, American Home Improvement Inc. took my preferences and tastes and with the assistance of their professional designer, turned what used to be an old ordinary condo unit, into a stunningly luxurious designer masterpiece. It is truly a transformed space, and a sight to behold. it is just beautiful. I absolutely love it!"
5,"Created a living and storage space in our previously unfinished basement. New floor, walls, ceiling.

We are looking forward to our next project (upstairs bathrooms) with American Home Improvement."
5,"It's been a pleasure to work with American Home Improvement Inc. Ben is very involved, a great communicator and trustworthy. If I send him a text or email he always get back to me right away. I've hired other companies in the past and have had a very disappointing experience! I have recommended American Home Improvement Inc , Inc to friends."
5,"We decided that we were going to remodel our house.  We received a few bids and decided on American Home Improvement.   We are remodeling our kitchen, all flooring and two bathrooms.   Our contractor Jack is very detail oriented and has extensive knowledge.  The sub contractors were courteous and worked around our schedule.  I was always asked at the end of the day if there was anything else that I wanted done and they responded to my needs.  They always cleaned up after they were completed for the day. The craftsmanship was outstanding.  Jack was very patient with us.  Some of our decisions took a little time. Plus we had the work done during a worldwide pandemic so supplies were short but he still finished on time and on budget.  I highly recommend American Home Improvement and especially Jack."

Highly recommend this company to take away your renovation concerns and get it done in a timely manner with very little mess or fuss. They helped us through the design process, selecting vanities, faucets etc as well as mirrors and colours. They were so professional and friendly - They did it all including demolition, plumbing, electrical, installation of tub, faucets, toilets etc as well as tiling. They were very easy to work with and did a great job."

5,"I cannot day enough about Gerhard and his team Nadia, John and Elvis! This is a team that works with the utmost integrity and takes so much pleasure in their craft. My bathroom is perfect. They never ended their day with making sure everything was spotless. I truly felt like they were part of the family and miss them. Their workmanship is impeccable and my washroom has made my family and friend a envious! Thank you so much and I would use them again and again without hesitation! Can not wait for my kitchen Reno now!"

5,"We have a complete remodel of our house in La Canada Flintridge in July 2020 - four bedrooms, three bathrooms, den, living room and kitchen.  Our Project Manager Neev was very professional, organized and provided a lot of ideas and resources for us to get to the design we wanted.  Neev was able to navigate through the workplace COVID restrictions, ensuring that only the necessary employees are on site with proper PPE and social distancing.  Neev made sure we were on track to procure what we needed. Neev was able to orchestrate the project despite the pandemic-imposed supply chain limitations that impacted delivery of the important construction materials (hardwood floors for the entire 2,800 sq. ft. house, tiles, etc.).  We were further impressed at how transparent and dedicated Neev was despite of competing projects.  AHI and Neev is highly recommended."

I recommend the use of American Home Improvement Inc to everyone.

5,"We called American Home Improvement Inc for a kitchen remodel project. After talking to several other contractors we decided to go with American Home Improvement Inc and are so happy with their work! I love my new kitchen!  It was a pleasure to work with this team - they were very responsive, professional and easy to work with. I highly recommend them!!"
5,"We had our entire kitchen and our bathroom done with American Home Improvement Inc. It was a great experience from the initial meeting through to the finished product. David was our designer. He is extremely patient and very helpful! We had a few quirky design wishes, which he happily went along with and made happen!  Have recommended American Home Improvement Inc to friends who were also happy, and we’ll definitely use them again in the future!!"
5,"We re-did our kitchen and two bathrooms from American Home Improvement Inc. We had David and his super crew!  Very comfortable and confident in his skills and knowledge. We were impressed and delighted with our new house. Everything was clean and they even cleaned out the ventilation system! I am a hard skeptic when it comes to labor work, and I must admit that for once I was blown away and impressed by work done in my house."
5,"American Home Improvement Inc did a great job on our new kitchen. They took my vision and new kitchen floor plan, and made it real. David sat with us for several sessions to complete the layout and problem solve where needed. He offered good suggestions as well. There were some hiccups, however when brought to their attention, they addressed issues promptly, so you do have to be your own advocate (which will apply with every company). All in all, a great end product and a positive customer experience."
5,American Home Improvement Inc completely gutted our master bath down to the studs. They even had to replace much of the sub floor. We are so pleased with the results. Highly recommend this company. They took pride in doing it right and keeping me informed and happy!!
5,"American Home Improvement Inc was referred to me by a relative that used their services for a kitchen remodel. Had the pleasure of working with David for the completion of my bar in the basement. David was very attentive and understood the vision I was trying to accomplish. We had a few concerns during the process but David was quick to rectify the situation. Overall, I would recommend American Home Improvement Inc."
5,"My amazing experience with American Home Inc started before I even owned my new dream home.The scope ended up being popcorn ceiling removal, new flooring throughout, two brand new washrooms (one with walk in shower), all new lighting, kitchen enhancements and a full paint job etc. Very professional team! Thanks David for making it real! Will recommend American Home Improvement Inc all my friends!"
5,"The work done by Sam and David exceed all my expectations. Professional, polite, clean and thoughtful are just a few of the words to explain how happy we are with their work. From day one to the day they left it was always a pleasure dealing with them. The end product is better than we hoped. They are not the cheapest out there but I believe the price reflects their dedication and attention to detail.

I highly recommend AHI to anyone looking for a contractor you can trust. I hope they stay in business forever, we will use them for all future renovations."
5,"I hired Hollywood Builders for a full kitchen remodel. Eli was able to look at photos of kitchens or parts of kitchens I like and came up with a design that was a great starting point. What I appreciated was how he was able to understand my style almost immediately. During the actual remodel, I was most impressed with just how quickly and easily any small mistakes (and they do happen) were rectified. The final product was just amazing! It looks great, but the best feeling was unpacking all my boxes full of kitchen stuff and finding that everything had it’s place, every drawer was used well, and there were no awkward or odd spaces that I wished I had done something different with. This kitchen is super functional and a pure joy to cook in and show off to my with family and friends."
5,"We had AHI team to do a complete renovation of a penthouse apartment, including the entire kitchen, two bathrooms and doors. They did an outstanding job.They consulted with me every step of the way and had some very good ideas. We couldn't be happier with our new apartment. I would highly recommend American Home Improvement for any kind of  apartment renovation/construction work."
5,"American Home Improvement Inc is courteous and professional. I had a great impression from Sam's on-site visit, his apparent expertise in painting and the quick turnaround of a quote. Sam took the time to recommend and test samples of colors on the walls for me to choose. Sam and Benjamin were excellent on the job, very professional and responsive to all my requests. The completed job was of high quality and exceeded my expectations. They finished ahead of schedule and on budget. They cleaned up very well and left the place spotless. Thank you again American Home Improvement Inc! And the crew for a great job!"
5,Got a full bathroom remodeling done by American Home Improvement Inc Inc and I'm loving it. They provided me with a catalogue at first but I didn't quite like them so I gave them ideas and they got the 3D model ready which looked absolutely fantastic. And after confirming that they started working here which was done very smoothly. And now the completed product looks absolutely sunning and I love it. They are great to say the least.
5,"I am SO happy with my renovation! I had two structural walls removed, a complete kitchen re-do as well as new floors, lighting, baseboards and ceilings throughout the main living space of my house. David , Sam and the guys were phenomenal--they came in on budget, three weeks ahead of schedule, and everything was of the finest quality. It was a real pleasure to work with them, so much so that they will be renovating the other half of my house this summer. If I could rate them 6 out of 5, I would!"
5,Sam team are incredible! Don't bother looking anywhere else. They are worth every penny and they do a fantastic job. They went above and beyond on the job we were quoted and then noticed our main entry walls were a little beaten up....came back the next day with a quart of paint and spent extra time doing touch ups. We have very high expectations and they always meet them.
5,"American Home Improvement Inc provided a very high quality result for our bath remodel project. They were easy to communicate with, providing input when needed while still adhering to our rather detailed vision. Once started all work proceeded steadily and without delay. Work areas were kept neat and adjacent rooms well protected throughout construction. Cost was very reasonable."
5,"American Home Improvement Inc team went the extra mile and did all the other extras for me within the time frame they were given. They only added couple of months more for doing all the other changes which we couldn't leave for later. They helped me with picking all the finishing and consulted me about trying new ideas and textures, which I was hesitant about at the beginning, but since I was familiar with their work and design, we agreed to have it done the way they designed and we love everything now. I will definitely work with them again."
5,Sam and his team did an amazing job in creating our small builder kitchen into a Wonderful/Awesome Kitchen and made us a beautiful bar. I would recommend their services to everyone I know due to their excellent and efficient team. They listen to your needs and provide an optimum solution to make you smile.
5,"American Home Improvement Inc was recommended by a friend & they did not disappoint. David got back to us quickly and came by for a quote shortly after. He worked with us to decide the best colors, and his crew was punctual, polite and efficient and the work was excellent. So much so I hired them again a few months later to do another room in my house! We were very impressed."
5,"Great team to work with. After taking several quotations from several companies, we finally decided to go for fresh home innovations since their quote was the cheapest. The entire process was easy going, the crew was really professional. I would definitely recommend working with American Home Improvement Inc."
5,"Very pleased with my new kitchen. Very professional company. David did a great job recommending and designing it. Installation team were very professional and paid lot of attention to details.

5,"They were great to work with, painters were especially impressive of all the trades. Would highly recommend!"
5,"With numerous general contractors and home builders available to choose from, we selected American Home Improvement Inc again to begin construction on our new location. Price, quality, attention to details, and lead time were all concerns of ours. David & Sam were able to fulfill all of our anxieties."
5,"The company was very professional, stayed within the budget, specifications, and timeline agreed upon, and responsive. We were kept abreast of the process in each stage. We'll definitely rehire them for future projects."
5,"Even thinking of remodeling our kitchen was enough to drive me up the walls. We finally decided to pull the trigger and get estimates. After multiple estimates we where over the moon when we found AHI! David, the project manager, took his time and reviewed all the details with us. He made sure to never to make us feel rushed or pressured into buying anything. From when the job started to when it finished everything that Davidsaid would be done was done. There where some hiccups, some delays, but we where prepared for it all. Overall, I will recommend Davidsaid and AHI Builders to all my friends, family, and clients!!"
5,"They redid our kitchen and both bathrooms. A complete refurbish of these rooms. All new cabinets, floors, counter tops, painting, and reset necessary electrical components. We would certainly have them back. Great job."
5,They remodeled 3 of my bedroom including the master bedroom and the kitchen. The house now looks beautiful and the sense of space by them was awesome. I really love how the house looks like now. They are the best!
5,"Working with American Home Improvement Inc was a completely problem-free process. The excellent customer service, as well as the high level of communication that the employees maintained with me allowed us to concentrate on other things instead of getting stressed over the renovations and whether or not everything was going according to plan. Everything looks so much better than it did before. Thank you so much for a job well done."
5,We are very pleased with the work done thus far. David is a pleasure to work with. I'd recommend him to anyone!
5,"Excellent work for the price. Job was completed a day early. Kenneth was very courteous, professional, and a diligent worker. Would recommend him to my friends and family."
5,"I had been recommended American Home Improvement Inc from a friend. I had been telling her about me and my wife's experiences getting estimates from contractors for our kitchen. She said she had worked with Benjamin and AHI in the past, that they were father and son owned and that they do great work. I decided to give them a shot. I'm happy, my wife's happy thanks to Benjamin and AHI."
5,"American Home Improvement remodel our home. We upgraded our kitchen and bathrooms, installed hardwood flooring and repainted the interior and exterior of our house. We were so impressed with their attention to detail, and how well organized the construction company runs. The entire project was handled professionally and the final result was a reflection of our taste. Our kitchen and bathroom remodel came out better than we expected. During the work that they did at my house, I could see that they are detail oriented, hardworking and skilled. They did the work remarkably beautiful. My old kitchen was demolished completely and they installed new plumbing, cabinets, lightings and appliances while in the bathroom they replaced the tub and shower while installing new floor, hardware and vanity with double sink. During the work, I noticed that Daniel was very honest and fair with me while having excellent communication skills as well. I didn't experienced any hidden charges or additional extras. With my past experience it was hard to find a team who knows their work so well and that honesty is their main factor. I would definitely work with them again!!!"
5,"After three weeks, just got started. I'll let you know. I will update the rating when the work is completed.  While I would have liked to have more work done, the work Micky did was more than I thought was possible, on my budget. He was always very professional and kept me up to date. I don't know if it was the time of year that delayed the work, but I'm very happy with the end results."
4,"After interviewing several contractors, we hired AHI to remodel our master bathroom, guest bathroom, and laundry room. Within hours of initially contacting them, AHI sent a project manager, Neev, to our house to generate a quote. From the outset, Neev was detail oriented, picked up on issues that other contractors had missed, and sat down with us to generate a quote on-site. AHI’s quote was comparable to other bids, so we ultimately chose them for the project because they seemed the most service-oriented and capable of delivering what we wanted. I’m glad we did.

Neev was very responsive, communicative, and organized throughout the project. He helped us work through a couple of issues that arose in renovating a 100-year old house without nickel-and-diming us.  His foreman, Tal, was very hands-on and helped us settle some design issues, and the entire crew was polite and respectful of our home. Despite some setbacks, the team finished on time and we are thrilled with the work."
5,Shawn was wonderful. He came out same day for a quote and was available soon after for another project. He was respectful and great at communicating the steps along the way. It was better than I could imagine! Thanks!
5,Micky did a great job for a great price and I would use his services again!! Everything went really well.
5,"A general contractor that is experienced, professional and great to work with! These guys really know what they are doing!

We would definitely recommend AHI to anyone undertaking a kitchen remodel and bedroom or your next remodeling."
5,This contractor is highly recommended! He was able to fix the problems of another contractor. Most of all he can do many many things with a high degree of quality. This is HIGHLY recommended handyman! Thanks Precision Contracting for all the great work you have done in my home and will definitely hire again.
5,"I was quite pleased and happy with the work that Micky did for me and will be contracting him to do more work on my home in the very near future. Please continue to keep him on your list as he was courteous, timely and did excellent work!!"
5,American Home Improvement Inc made my apartment absolutely new . I love my new dark hardwood and walls that are looking like a brick now . Bathroom -. Overall guys did an excellent work . That was exactly what I paid for .
5,"American Home Improvement decided to remodel my kitchen, anticipating the value of my condo to increase. I interviewed 3 contractors and American Home Improvement was the only company I invited over to my condo for a follow up meeting and agreed on a labor price and signed the contract. The job was completed in 30 days, work was up to par as expected. I knew i was in good hands from the beginning of the job.  I've been meaning to write this review for a while because this company deserves it, thank you American Home Improvement."
5,"American Home Improvement Inc has helped us turn our house into a beautiful, warm home.  We cannot thank them enough for their hard work and commitment to improving our home before our baby arrived.

5,"I only have the highest praises for Neev, his company and his work. From the beginning, Neev displayed so much warmth and sincerity towards us. From the first consultation, he gave tremendous time and detail to what we could anticipate if we were to hire him for our project, a full bathroom remodel. He was never in a rush, so open to conversation, and actively listened to what our expectations were for our project. Neev always carried himself with utmost professionalism, while establishing and maintaining a personal relationship, with constant, open and timely communication. The entire process was incredibly smooth. Neev gave us direction each step of the way, allowing us to choose our style and shop within our budget. Everything was done is a timely fashion and the project was finished so quickly! Every person involved in the project was professional, and we did not feel that our privacy was invaded at any point. We could not be happier with the final result of the bathroom. We would recommend Neev to anyone looking to do any remodeling or reconstruction, and would definitely work with him in the future! Thank you Neev!"
5,The installers were very professional and polite. My home looks brand new and definitely added to the total value. I would recommend them for any home owner. I love the way the they designed.
5,American Home Improvement just finished a painting job for me and they were great.  It was a difficult job with a lot of detail work on an old building and they stayed until it was perfect.  Everything was checked over by someone with an eye for detail and it passed with flying colors. I would definitely American Home Improvement.
5,"We chose American Home Improvement  for a large kitchen and bathroom project that took 2+ months. It was a fantastic decision because the crew treated us like family, were incredibly communicative, and professional, kind and did a fantastic job. Even when they did the initial demolition, they left our house swept and ready for us to walk through. It's a best case scenario for having contractors in your house everyday. When it comes to design they are fantastic, and helped us make decisions that really improved the look and feel of our space. We couldn't be happier with the final outcome!"
5,"We were very pleased with American Home Improvement Inc!  Our home needed foundation repair along the entire front of the house as well as replacement of the entry stairs which also meant rebuilding a portion of exterior wall and re stucco.  Benjamin was easy to deal with and did exactly what he said he would do.  The contract and payment schedule was clearly spelled out.  They started the job when they said, his workers showed up every day on time, cleaned up after themselves every day and they finished within a day or so of scheduled completion.  I was extremely impressed with how efficient and how well-calculated they were with their time and scheduling. They were attentive to our needs and always followed up with to make sure that we were happy.I would recommend to everyone."
5,"Excellent work, completed ahead of time and was very competitively priced. They did a major repair on our kitchen & bathroom. Two walls taken down, a window put in, plus a lot of other work on the house, including electrical, moving a gas line, and redoing floors.  I recommend American Home Improvement without hesitation."
5,"Benjamin and his team exceeded our expectations for our renovation. Our home had lots of challenges that other contractors couldn't overcome! Benjamin and his team not only figured out how to work out the challenges, but transformed our home into a beautiful place. We are so grateful for their attention to detail and design. Thank you American Home Improvement Inc and Benjamin  
for a great experience."
5,"Thanks to American Home Improvement Inc for our amazing kitchen! In addition to our kitchen, they also performed painting, plumbing, and some general contractor work all at a reasonable price. My husband and I found them very easy to work with and very professional. We would recommend them to anyone looking to have their kitchen or bath remodeled."
5,"I needed to add a shower in my parents room and David and his crew came through.  David listened intently to my parents needs and offered creative and practical solutions to the limited space available.  For the shower addition, he was able to skillfully make it so one could roll a wheelchair right in, with no step at all.  A slight slope was made for wheelchair access and water drainage. David offered to assist me in choosing tile, fixtures, and grab bars for my parents.  They look beautiful.  He had to deal with many different personalities at my parents home and he was patient and professional through the whole job.  His crew was always prompt, friendly and cleaned up after themselves. He finished the job in just a few weeks. My parents are so happy with the finished project.  We would definitely use him again."
5,"Very pleased with our bathroom remodel!  They have done the job in no time, with careful cleanup when they were done. Installation then went forward with no delays, no waiting for materials or available crew. Nick helped with selection of beautifully coordinated tile, which was installed with meticulous attention to detail.  Excellent communications and supervision throughout the whole project.  And the price was reasonable.  We would hire them again for our future need and highly recommended Nick and AHM for your next construction!!"
5,Shawn and his guys did a unbelievable job on my bathroom. My bathroom was all were old tile from the 80's with a leaking shower. Now we have white marble with amazing borders. When I was searching for company's all the construction company's I contacted gave me a horrible vibe from the start. I decided to invite 2 contractors to my house and Shawn was one of them. He suggested different options on expanding my bathroom and changing the layout at an affordable price. I felt very comfortable with him and his crew during the job and feel very confident with the quality after. The premises was kept clean during the job which was agreed upon in our original meeting and the job was completed on a timely manner. I had mentioned to Shawn I've always wanted a rain shower so he decided it was a good idea to surprise me with one as we did not agree to it on the original contract. I owe it to this company for such professional and quality work. I recommend Shawn and his crew for any of your remodeling and/or construction projects.
5,"I will hire this company again. They did work for both my neighbors and they referred me them. They did my exterior painting, windows, bathroom vanity and tile. The job exceeded my expectation and the time of work was 2 weeks from start to end. I will be calling this company again"
5,I recently contacted 1oak remodeling through a friend as she just remodeled her kitchen. I also just went through a big renovation and was not in the mood for another one although I urgently needed to repair my driveway and landscape the front of my home. They set an appointment with me and guided me through all the steps and procedures. My job finished in 1 week!!! They had a full crew working everyday to make my dreams come true. This company is really 1 of a kind! Thank you for all your help!!
5,"Shawn from AHI did an excellent job.  I recently hired them to remodel my 80 year old Mother's bathroom.  My intention was to accommodate handicapped accessible usage to an older home.  Most contractors that I contacted prior to the remodel wanted to sell an elaborate over the top remodel to a room that I had already laid out with my ideas and intentions.  Those contractors that came out, came as a team and wanted to sign a on the spot 1 day only sale price, otherwise the price would go up.  After contacting them, I was listened to, told them what I wanted and they proposed a reasonable solution.  There was no pressure or ""sales"" attack.  Having dreaded doing a job like this while meeting with several shady contractors, I was pleasantly surprised with the fact that they took care of everything.  No surprises or additional charges, etc.  Just a competent, professional and thorough job from a very happy customer.  I would highly recommend Shawn and American Home Improvement your remodeling needs."
5,I awarded American Home Improvement Inc my Wiltshire home renovation and am very pleased with their service. Very clean crew and they are perfectionists!!! Love their work and their collaboration with my Designer. Thank you Jose!
5,"American Home Improvement in Los Angeles! They understands quality and good building practices. From start to finish their attention to detail is excellent. The work site is always well organized and clean. Michael did an outstanding job overseeing the construction project. I had a room addition built and completely renovated my entire house, including remodeling my kitchen and all four bathrooms. All of the workers were friendly and fantastic at their specific trade. They were easy to communicate with and made an effort to keep the site safe (I have a toddler). They came out, was very nice and Michael and his team was able to complete the remodeling in less than a month. All the materials were selected from his vendors and Michael was able to get us a nice discount. During the whole remodeling, Michael visited us often and informed us about the progress and any problem that came up and what solution can solve it. His honesty and professionalism proved itself during this work and we are thankful for that. I would recommend this contractor to anyone that values quality and detailed work!!!"
5,"I hired American Home Improvement Inc for a whole house remodel. We pretty much broke down all interior and exterior walls and reconfigured walls to create an open floor plan. I believe they have before and after photos on their profile, not sure if the photos are up yet but boy was it a transformation! Throughout the process, I learned so much about construction. Never realized how many tedious decisions are needed in order to remodel a house, starting with kitchen cabinets, counter tops, blinds, color of paint, floors, on and on and on. Overall it was a great project, and I would hire these guys to work for me again in a heartbeat. Most important thing to me is being able to stay true to my preset budget."
5,I had my house renovated by the and I loved the time I spent working with them. The staffs are very nice and open to any suggestions and accept the help if given. I had a great time with them and they did the job very good too. Definitely recommend them.

5,"Their crew is amazing. They did my kitchen and bathroom, and I couldn't have been happier with their job. They were very nice and friendly, they kept the workspace clean and organized which helped everyone in that situation move around the house with more comfort. They know how to make their customers happy and provide good servicing with their tools. Working with them has been awesome for me so I'll recommend them to anyone needing a remodeling."
5,I called them in for my home renovation and they sent someone to check things and give an estimate . The think i was more concerned about is if I would get the kind of look i want from them. But to my surprise they provided me good quality design which was spot on with my expectation on the remodeling. The team sent to my work was very friendly. Their service is very good.I will definitely call American Home Improvement Inc if i want another redesign.
5,"I needed a garage conversion and I heard that American Home Improvement is right company for that job. They respond quickly to my quote and gave me best possible offer and I hired them.

5,My experience with American Home Improvement couldn't really have been any better. They did a wonderful job on my front porch. This is my second project using them and i would not hesitate to hire them again. Highly recommend them.
5,"I am very pleased with the work Done by Sibay, I hired this contractor to remodel the kitchen in my new home because I didn't have enough counter space and I bake a lot.

The contract was specific, the company had a payment schedule and they even helped me finance the project. The kitchen is just perfect for my baking needs now.

Only set back was that there was a door that was accidentally scratched when the counter tops where being installed but they fixed the door a few days later. My sister is hiring them also for her bathroom and I hope she has just the same experience as I did."
5,"Working with Shawn was great, after visiting their location and meeting the staff I felt very comfortable with my decision to remodel. The process wasn't always easy but Shawn made it easy for us to live in the home during construction. The workers were very polite and the projects were completed on time and I couldn't be happier."
4,"I got American Home Improvements to renovate my house, and they did it so good! They came in and completed the job fast. But there was no decline in quality of the job despite them being fast. I really loved the staff's behaviors. They were friendly and easy to communicate with. I helped them as much as I could. The final result of their job was superb. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a renovation."
5,"American Home Improvement did our bathroom remodel. This company deserves 6 stars if that was possible! I usually shop around before I make a choice. I can say in confidence that I can totally recommend them for either small or big jobs.  The crew were very professional, and on top of their work and especially their prices are very compatible.  They went above and beyond what they promise!"
5,"I can only say that American Home Improvement has been the greatest company in the field of construction in terms of no hassle. I appreciated everything about working with them. It was easy reaching out to them and speaking with a representative about my plans and estimates. The inspection where we over my remodel in detail and decided on a price was a friendly affair (considering the fairness of the price). Lastly, the project itself was finished one week ahead of schedule, and it was done beautifully! My family and I could not be happier with our new living room and kitchen."
5,"American Home Improvement remodeled my father's bathroom and it came out great.

We liked working with him so much and loved the work that they did that we are already in talks for another project."
5,"American home improvement helped me remodel and completely make my home energy efficient and made it affordable for my family to do so with a energy efficiency financing option.

I was also able to upgrade my electrical panel and will be having solar panels installed in the next few months."
5,"I hired American home for a remodel of my guest house and addition of a master suite, I couldn't be happier with the work they did. My project manager Shawn was always available to answer my questions and the work turned out better than I imagined."

5,"American Home Improvement designed my kitchen. I already worked with them and I knew that they are very trustworthy company. They did excellent job, completed on time and I am completely satisfied."
5,"We replaced all cabinetry, tile and fixtures for the entire bathroom including moving the tub and creating a new shower area. We had a leak under the previous cabinetry so there were also remediation work and lots of demo leading into the project. We hired them mainly because, unlike other contractors, they were full-service from the design end. Their mobile showroom really helps you make decisions, even on the minor details, and Eli helped us get ideas and ensure that our design choices would work together (for example making sure that all the plumbing fixtures were compatible). We also requested some unique features (like a rock river effect in the tile/grout leading from the shower to the bathroom door) that we had an idea for that resulted in a solution they helped design. The team was professional throughout and clearly worked together well. Work was done on time and within budget. The cleaning crew they had come in at the end was world class as well."
5,"This was the most amazing experience remodeling a kitchen that I think you could ask for!  Neev was incredible with the timeline, what to expect, when to expect it and even completed the project early!  It is a big undertaking to not have a kitchen for awhile and it was completely worth it!  The work is impeccable, I could always reach Neev and he was always willing to work with me or explain if I didn't understand what was happening next.  The best experience!"

There were a few delays so the project took longer than expected but it looks great. The day to day trade workers were very respectful. professional and hard workers.  I would recommend this company to others planning a home renovation."
5,"I’m not one to typically post a review, but after our recent experience with American Home Improvement and specifically our project manager Neev Kugel, I felt obliged to comment on their phenomenal work.  We contracted them to remodel our kitchen as well as re-do the flooring in adjacent rooms and other related improvements.  I was extremely impressed by how professional Neev and the whole operation was from start to finish.  Outside of knowing we wanted to update our kitchen, my wife and I really didn’t have a clear vision on exactly how we wanted it to look.  We essentially put our faith and trust in Neev to deliver an end product that we would love and he didn’t disappoint.  At the start of the project, Neev brought in designers who were very knowledgeable, creative and receptive to our ideas to help create a contemporary and elegant design that both my wife and I loved.  From there, Neev developed the project plan and timeline that was consistent with the original estimate.  
Throughout the entire process, Neev was very communicative and would always clearly outline next steps so we knew what to expect.  This made the process much smoother and reduced the typical frustration that can come with remodels because we always knew the status of the work.  

Now this is not to say the project was completed without any snags.  As with any project, there were surprises that came up.  However, Neev always worked with us to explain the issue, outline our options, and would work with us to make sure we were happy with the final outcome. All of the workers brought into our home showed the same level of professionalism and quality craftsmanship.  Most importantly, the final outcome of the remodel was outstanding.  Not only was everything completed on-time and on-budget, but it turned out absolutely stunning exceeding our expectations.  And as the say, the devil is in the details, and it was the details where the quality of the work came through.  It was clear that they do not cut corners.  The quality of the work was beyond reproach.  

In terms of price, we didn’t do much comparison shopping before going with AHI.  Neev impressed us when we initially brought him in so we didn’t get other bids for the project.  I can say anecdotally the price was very comparable to what some of our other friends paid for similar work.  And most importantly the price originally agreed to is was we ultimately paid, which is very important to me.  No bait and switch.   

All in all, I would highly recommend Neev and AHI if considering a home improvement project."
5,Excellent home remodeling company. They recently remodeled our kitchen and we really are very satisfied with the outcome. Eli was our project manager and he was very helpful. He also resolved some issued and made a project very simple although it wasn't at all. They finished the kitchen within promised time and we are very impressed with their quality of work. Thank you American Home Improvement!
5,"American Home Improvement just completed our bathroom and patio remodel and we could not be happier. Neev Kugel was our project manager and he is an absolute gem. He made sure that we were informed every step of the way what to expect for the weekly schedule and always knew who was coming and going. His communication was excellent. He always got back to me, no matter how trivial my question or concern might have been.  As this was our first remodel, Neev helped us design, select and accent our remodel by leading us in the right direction. We absolutely love our tile and Neev provided a specific shopping list that allowed us autonomy to select our own designs, while helping us avoid unnecessary expenses. 

The crew of artisans Neev brought in to do the work were amazing. From the demolition crew to the tile guys, they were all professional and clean. They arrived on time and were courteous and helpful. They went out of their way to be sure we were happy with the results and had us view everything as it was completed to be sure we were satisfied. Anything that needed to be addressed was handled right away and to our complete satisfaction. 

As I said in the beginning, we could not be happier with the whole experience. Neev and his crew turned an old, outdated bathroom in to a serene and relaxing place to be. It turned out exactly as I wanted, as Neev understood my vision and guided us in the right direction. We would not have what we do today were it not for him."
5,"I can only say positive things about my experience with American Home Improvement. My remodel was performed above my expectations by a very qualified and talented design and remodeling team.

5,"American Home Improvement has been phenomenal to work with. They lay out what your project will consist of at the start, so there are no surprises when the project is taking place. Their designers are skilled and experienced and also patient enough to listen to the input of the customer.

They ended up finalizing the kitchen remodel in just 3 weeks as we agreed on. This was an above average remodeling experience that consisted of everything I recommend others look for when doing business with a contractor. Transparency, professionalism, and timeliness."
5,"I had many issues with my roof if recent time and I thought it was time to replace it. I already worked with American Home Improvement so I called them to send someone to inspect my roof. They agreed it was time to replace it and gave me several solutions. I accepted one of them and they were available soon.

The installation went OK, there were some issues but it was resolved easily. My new roof looks amazing thanks to American Home Improvement!!"

The work started with the repair and resurface of the concrete at the back of the house its been a while since it had lots of cracks and it had to be fixed. Ziv was able to give me a good estimate to remove the old one and to install the new one. While the workers worked on that, Ziv noticed a problem with the windows and he recommended me to replace them with a new ones in order to solve that too. because they were working at the house already, Ziv was able to give me a better price and it was worth to do. At the end of the repairs, i asked Ziv if he can install new closets in 2 of the bedrooms. The new closets came out great and very useful."
5,"American Home Improvement just finished remodeling of our bathroom and I love, love, love it. Crew was responsible, cooperative and each did an excellent job in their domain. They seemed to be on the same page as to what was going on. I always felt project manager was there and had all the bases covered. He made the job as painless as possible. Now I have a beautiful bathroom and hope American Home Improvement will be available when I am ready for my next project."
5,"Sam at American home improvement was expert, thorough, methodical, timely, truthful, and polite right from the first meeting that we had, during all of his teams work and much more after the remodeling job was completed.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend American Home Improvement for any project you have in mind."
5,"Dependable, honest, receptive and very flexible. My first major remodeling project that I did was to remodel my entire house and because it was a large scale remodeling project, I had made many modifications to the original plan that was done by me and Mickey from American home improvement during the construction. Mickey was very open minded, objective and during the work he kept providing a great amount of help of the advantages and disadvantages of each and any of the change that I had to do. I highly recommend the remodeling services of American home improvement and mainly Mickey. The whole crew and people were very experienced, professional and hard working."

The bathroom remodeling package included: new floor, new Jacuzzi, shower and vanity the bathroom remodeling took less than a month and while all the materials was on the way to the house, the workers were able to replace the floor and complete the windows and paint. All our conversations with all the people from their office and workers were nice nice and professional. We didn't need to reschedule any appointment and they came on time and day that was setup.

However when we contacted American home improvement we felt from our first meeting with their representative Isaac that this company is a completely different style of people and we had a very good feeling about them. The on-site crews were very friendly, hard workers and efficient with lots of patience with us. Isaac the project manager was very communicative person and always returned our calls.

We give American home improvement a truly 5 stars rating."
5,"Honestly….. We had a truly pleasure for hiring American home improvement and having Mark remodel our kitchen and the entry of our house. Mark and his team, did a wonderful remodeling job that started with a draft design and ended with a complete remodeling. We now have a new kitchen that have lots of storage space and new layout! At the entry of the house, he replaced the existing door with a larger one and he removed a wall that expand that space while merging it beautifully into the living room area. The overall price was a bit above my budget because we did some modifications to the design after we started the remodeling and we completely agreed to it and the end results are truly worth it. We highly recommended American home improvement and the working people that did our remodeling."
5,"American Home Improvement team were great to work with. They came in on budget and time like said. Easy to get in touch with when we had any questions or concerns.

Already referred them to a few people and would use them again. Thanks American Home Improvement team!!"
5,"We just completed our remodeling with Isaac and his professional team. Our new house looks stunning! All the involved workers were expert, truthful and reliable. In any project, it’s inevitable to run into problems and issues, but when those issues came up at our house, Isaac was there to solve them fast and with a smile. His approach and rapid response kept the remodeling progress going fast but he never cut any corner. This is our first remodeling and Isaac was easygoing and described the major steps of the remodeling and he was very clear on all the costs and scheduling. During the remodeling, several issues came up and Isaac helped and even did several tasks without any additional charges. We certainly recommend American home improvement and would hire them again!"
5,"I did a large scale remodeling project of my house in Reseda, with American home improvement. They did the perfect remodeling job on top of the service and quality that all together were much higher than perfect.

Mickey was an amazing, skilled, straight forward person that know very well how to take care of everything from start to finish! I absolutely recommend them!"
5,"I don't normally write reviews but I felt that America Home Improvement team deserved some recognition. We had our kitchen redone, removing an interior wall to open up the space as well as adding an egress window in the basement. These guys finished in record time and didn't cut corners but really were careful and thorough. Repairmen/technician were pleasant, polite, VERY hardworking and always cleaned up at the end of the day. As expected with renovations, minor mishaps and unexpected surprises did occur but they were dealt with reasonably and courteously. They priced their work fairly and really did a great job. I would definitely call America Home Improvement again."

We wanted high quality kitchen so we knew it will not be cheap and we hired American Home Improvement because their project was much better than from other companies.

We met with Mickey and during all the meetings that we had, he spend extra time to really understand what we want to achieve, what is our style and preferred design. This was a huge plus for us because we felt that he really care about our project and not only in making money. We needed to expand and upgrade our kitchen by moving the laundry space to the garage and removing a wall between the dining room area to the kitchen. This made us the exact open space and entertaining area that we wanted. More than that, we replaced some of the windows so we can have natural light. In the kitchen we added an island with 6 seating that will face one of the windows overlooking the back yard. The team of Mickey guided us to make the remodeling stress free including helping us with the purchase of all the cabinets, floors, marble, tiles and appliances.

1,"Do not trust this company.  The project started out well but quickly became a nightmare. This large company hires out contractors to get work and doesn't seem to check these contractors experience.  The guy that I learned later was a great salesman, but didn't know how to create a simple footing.  I had to correct his formwork! Then after he promised to prove himself, he failed again and the rebar was all wrong.
 I asked AHI for a new contractor.  They agreed and would keep promising to fix the same issue. 4 different people were sent out over 3 weeks and each one didn't speak to the previous one and knew nothing about the project. They all agreed that the work by the first contractor was not correct, but each crew also contradicted each other. It's like they didn't even know who came out before and I would have to explain what is going on.
 AHI would promise again and again to correct the issue and each time they failed. I have worked in the construction industry on large and small projects for over 10+ years.  I have never experienced any company with such a lack of communication and incompetence.  DO NOT HIRE AHI."
5,"WONDERFUL KITCHEN REMODEL  AHI is an excellent company that strives to fully satisfy. Met with Eli and unlike other companies, AHI was the only company that truly listened to my desires and made sure to explain all possible options and limitations that could lie ahead. They have a trustworthy, courteous and hardworking group of craftsman. Eli was there throughout the job progress. The end was everything and more than I was hoping for. While they were not the cheapest price wise - although was very reasonable, the cost is worth it in the end. You made my family very happy and proud of our new kitchen. Thank you!"
5,"Thank God for a great company. Nick came out & they did a complete redesign/renovation of our home (aprox 3000 sq ft.). Amazing attention to detail and incredibly responsive. Aside from a couple of minor hiccups (all projects of this scale will have some), they far exceeded all of our expectations and would immediately turn to them if we were to have any additional renovation needs. These guys are full service -- from creating the design to following through in making it exactly as it was planned. Everyone at this company, from the person answering the phone to the owners care and work hard to make one's renovations go smoothly."
5,"My new kitchen was remodeled and supervised by American home improvement under Elad. Elad designed and implemented the kitchen by generating a 3D design for the kitchen, providing me with several options of styles, colors and appliances. After several meetings that I had with him, I was able to come up with a design and style that I liked and Elad took care of the rest. My remodeling was hassle free because Elad was able to place the orders, making sure that everything will be delivered to my house so the remodeling will not be delayed or effected by missing any of the items/materials. Elad was nice to me and he always answered my calls or returned them within a reasonable time period. I highly recommend this company. The new kitchen came out excellent and exactly the way it should be."
5,"We truly love American home improvement! We had a wonderful time during the remodeling work that they did at our house and we highly recommend this company! Mark was able to deliver everything he promise and even more. We originally hired them to completely redo the kitchen and bathroom on top of few other tasks around the house. One of our friend is an interior designer by profession and she joined us and helped on the design of our new stunning kitchen, brand new cabinets, new hardware, paint, counter tops and more. Mark and his team were able to join forces very well with her and we were happy by that because it saved us money. In the master bedroom and bathroom we removed the existing tub and installed new hot tub including the replacement of all the existing floors and walls in addition to replacing all the light fixtures and the vanity mirrors. We fell that we are very blessed by having American home improvement and that the remodeling project was completed right before the holidays. We are currently thinking of doing another project and of course we will hire American home improvement! We are very satisfied with all the people at American home improvement that were involved at our house project that we invited all of them for a BBQ after the job was done."
5,"American home improvement remodeled completely our kitchen and laundry room and it came out gorgeously. We found American home improvement through online website. We wanted to upgrade and renew the kitchen we had because it was old style and needed to be more functional so we used American home improvement for that and the kitchen is now more than what we wanted. We are very fascinated with the precision of the cabinets, countertops and paint (on top of the other parts of the work). Isaac made sure that everything will be without any mistake or error. They were very professional & hardworking people. All the communication could not been better between us to Isaac to the labor crew. The overall experience in this project was great and pleasant. Isaac was the best project manager. He kept us in the constant loop and made sure that all of our concerns will be addressed. Very detailed oriented and high communication skills person. We definitely consider working again with Isaac & American home improvement!"
5,"We hired American home improvement for our entire house remodeling. We recently purchased this house and it was in an immediate updates. Our supervisor was Isaac which during the whole work was very reliable, hardworking person, always available, quickly respond our calls or messages. Like any other remodeling project, we came across several problems which we thought will increase the overall budget BUT Isaac took care of them right away. His team, were all wonderful and we have no complain against any of them! They worked hard and fast while making sure that everything works and come out great. We truly know that other contractors (in case we hired them for that job) might do it cheaper, but the quality of the work that Isaac did – can’t be compared at all. Now our house is back to life and looks brand new. Thank you Isaac and the wonderful team!"
5,"I hired American Home Improvement for the remodeling project of my master closet, master bathroom and mainly the kitchen. I had my vision of how I want them to be done and more than that, I was able to design my drawings of the spaces and I just needed someone reliable that can make it happen. I spoke to few contractors and met with them too. One of them was Mickey. Mickey was very nice, professional and skilled contractor when we met and he captured my attention compare to the other ones. The remodeling supposed to be finish within a month of work but due to several changes that we did during the work, it ended up that the remodeling took a little longer than it should but at the end…. I can say clearly that it was well worth it! I must mention also, that Mickey didn’t charge me anything more what we agreed on and he was very fair and honest while the quality of the work and the customer service was beyond compare."
5,"American home improvement has completed several projects in our house including the remodeling of our guest bathroom, master bathroom, kitchen and living room area. The design and remodeling was a custom European style/modern while the bathroom included a walk in tile shower, jet shower system, home automation and more… part of the design was to reposition the door opening for a much better use of space. American home improvement staff helped us by selecting all of the finish materials including the tiles, upper and lower cabinets, accessories and more… including the color/style of the paint. David included also in his work the remodeling of the guest bathroom, drywall, type of texture, baseboards etc. He has excellent, professional craftsmanship and creativity skills. American home improvements approach and talent to meet our deadlines were fantastic and he was able to finish the remodeling project on time. We definitely recommend American home improvement and all the involved people that worked at our house for any type or style of construction or remodeling projects. We are very pleased with the completed project and we will hire them again for more upcoming projects. Thanks American home improvement for a great job from a very happy customer."
5,"American Home Improvement and our project manager, Elad, have done a gorgeous remodeling job on our open space concept kitchen remodeling. We must admit that we are not easy clients! As part of our remodeling project, we removed several load bearing walls and installed new beams within the ceiling, poured concrete footings under the house, installed new hardwood floors from the living room into the kitchen and matched the drywall on the walls and ceiling in order to achieve a perfectly flat client and everything went smoothly. During the work, we lived at the house and the workers sealed off all the spaces that were not part of the work so the dust that we were so concerned of… was kept to minimum. Elad also made sure to stick to the main budget and the promised timeline (which was very important to us). We were warned by some friends that these days it’s very hard to find a good company that will provide the same service as we got from American Home Improvement! We are looking forward to hire them for additional projects in the future!"
5,"We had several meetings with Shean from American home improvement regarding to the kitchen that we want to remodel and what is our vision and goals. After he heard our thoughts, requests and fears, he came up with an incredible, open space kitchen and dining room area that came out much more stunning than we imagined. Not only does our new space look spectacular, it’s unique and very functional. Remarkably, Shean and all the people that were involved in our remodeling project, were professionals, hard-working people who really showed us that they care and treated it like it was their own home. The general attitude of American home improvement’s was very positive and impressive this is the main reason why we are writing this review and we highly recommend them."
5,"If we summarized our remodeling project, we will say that Daniel is the person that you will want to manage your remodeling project!!!!! we can’t write enough about his personality and working crew. They are all absolute professionals. Everything was performed within the time frame we agreed on and with the highest remodeling standards. Our brand new kitchen looks perfect! The crew was very polite, skilled and worked very hard to get the remodeling project done to our satisfaction. Daniel was in contact with all the relevant updates regards the remodeling and he was there for us most of the time to answer any questions we had. His ideas really made a huge impact in the way the kitchen came out. His skills and vision made this work so easy. The new kitchen is now the main place where we usually spend most of our time. We couldn’t be happier and pleased. We currently have more plans on remodeling additional sections at the house and we won’t call anyone else – that’s for sure."
5,"We hired Shean and his professional workers to remodel our master bathroom. The complete preparation of the bathroom space was great, easy and they made sure to cover everything to prevent all the dust to come out and make a mess. The old bathroom was taken down all the way to the studs while right after that, they took care of replacing all the plumbing and electrical so they will be replaced with new ones and being upgraded. The inside walls were replaced as well, new tile floor have been installed and the bathroom got new fresh paint. After all of that was completed, Shean start to install the new tub, and then the floor was grouted and polished. The double sink vanity and all the relevant hardware such as sinks, faucets, handles etc.… were installed as well including all the baseboards. I must mention that their skills, involvement, approach and ability to achieve the goals & stay within the budgets while working with other sub-contractors was outstanding. The finished project is beautiful and perfect. We would highly recommend this company, as well as Shean and his crew."
5,"I hired American home improvement to re-do my entire house that I recently purchased and planned to live in. I hired American home improvement to design and implement the construction of the Kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, hallways, front yard and back yard. Shean was the main people that I worked with and after several meetings and conversations about what I want to get, they were able to come up with the draft design that included everything I wanted and it fit my style and budget. The draft design was polished and finalized and I gave the approval for the work to start. They were very flex with the entire remodeling project and they even did several changes that came up during the work and they didn’t charge me for them. Any bump that appeared during the construction, the entire team was on top of it and they were able to find the right solution that worked out very well and they took the required measures to remedy the situation to my satisfaction. The team including Shean was very responsive to any of my phone calls, e-mails and even text messages and the working crew were skilled and courteous. I would recommend them to anyone!"
5,"""Exceptional, skilled, superb craftsmanship"" are just the little good words that we can write here that can define our experience with American home improvement. Right after we interviewed 4 other construction companies, we knew that Adam was the only one that we should hire to remodel our two bathrooms and kitchen. Adam was honest with us from the beginning, proved to be truly hardworking, on time and that his main focus was to leave this remodeling project within our budget. His whole working crew was clean and very skilled as well. Adam was in constant communication with us during the whole remodeling process and he kept up in the loop in regards to anything that was involved with the work. Adam made sure to visit our house daily while making sure that he is satisfied with the progress and mainly that we love the work that they do. Their final work shows how we were correct about hiring them for our house and it came out so beautiful and mainly functional. We highly recommend American home improvement!"
5,"American home improvement was recommended to us by one of our close friends, the American home improvement team were very skilled and hardworking people. Daniel is a skilled contractor and designer who give 100% of himself in order to achieve the very best of work. Our project included the kitchen and master bedroom and bathroom and was managed by Daniel while executing by his team. The entire remodeling is a huge success and we are very happy with the results of how it came out. Each time we walk and use our new kitchen, we totally amazed and happy. The same feeling we have for the rest of the remodeling as well. Everything in the work including the painting, new insulation, woodworking, cabinets etc… are in perfect final results. In regards to the communication and reports – Daniel made sure to keep us in the loop in regards to anything involved with the work. We are very happy."
5,"Over the years, our house has suffered from some abuse from our kids and dogs. It was about time to do some upgrades and renovations to bring new life to the house. We wanted to do a complete remodeling and we start our searching for a designer and home improvement contractor. Our search brought us to American home improvement and we made an appointment with Or for an in house consultation. Almost right away we knew that he will be the one that will do the work. He spent with us over 3 hours browsing our house and asking many questions about what we were looking for to get in the remodeling. At the first meeting he came up with great ideas and few solutions as how to transform our home into a gorgeous and functional place to live. After several meetings with Or and his designer, our process of remodeling started. All our neighbors said how courteous & considerate the people at American home improvement were. We could see how the American home improvement crew were skilled and exhibited a great sense of craftsmanship and attention to details. It was clear how they took pride in what they were building. Or is not only extremely creative and skilled… but very detail oriented person and he asked the same from his people. Both Or and his crew delivered much more than they promised. If something was not 100% good, Or had it redone. He went above and beyond his words to make sure we were happy. The final results are a gorgeous statement of pride, craftsmanship and promises kept. We will continue to recommend American home improvement to anyone who asks. Thank you Or and your team too. If ever we need to do this again it would be our pleasure to have American home improvement."
5,"The guys at American home improvement were wonderful, we got from them the best deal for our remodeling project and we are very happy with how it came out. We wanted to be to remove two walls that we had in the middle of the room. After we got several estimates from 4 other companies, we decided to reject all of them for various reasons and to hire American home improvement for it. Sam came over to our house several times before the work was even started. He wanted to make sure that the design will represent exactly what we wanted to have and more than that, was the price. After we loved the design and the price, Sam started the work and it went very smoothly and without any problem. Sofia at the office, made sure that all the required paperwork will be done correctly and that we won’t have any delay with the progress. We truly love the new kitchen that Sam did for us and we highly recommend them to anyone."
5,"American home improvement did several sections at my house including the remodeling of my master bathroom, 2 Additional bathrooms and paint the entire house. The whole work turned out to an amazin results. Or was the main person that I dealt with and he was amazingly easy person to work with. His in-house designer made so many great design solutions and ideas while placing all of my needs and vision into the final budget. The entire work was done by skilled and professional people who made extra attention on cleaning and productivity. During the work, there was never a mess and each day and before everyone left for the day, the workers made sure to dedicate and hour or so for organize the working space and the following morning when they came to work, they will set up tarps and covers on all the floors and areas. The bathrooms were a complete remodeling tasks where they removed everything and rebuild it based on the new design. The new design gave us a huge shower space (after removing the bath tub) with glass enclosure, a normal size bench and awesome floors and walls tile work. I’m very happy with the work and would recommend them for any remodeling project."
5,"I called American home improvement after my massive research about their services and I was very pleased with what I read and saw. After I spoke to the representative, I asked them to schedule an appointment with and to discuss my project and to see what I can do. To my house arrived Shean and went over me about the kitchen and living room remodeling project and after 2 additional meetings, the work started. I will not go into all the micro details here, but I was very happy and surprised with the quality of the work and mainly how they managed everything. American home improvement are by far the most professional company I have ever got involved with and it was clear during each and every stage of the way. I do recommend them for any type of remodeling project such as upgrading, new construction or any other type of construction work."
5,"We wanted to remodel our Kitchen completely on top of the remodeling of the main floor (paint and new floor). One family member of us recommended that we should talk to Ziv at American home improvement before making any decision with the other contractors. After speaking with Ziv, it was pretty clear to us that we should hire them for that work and to leave the other contractors. Ziv gave us a perfect direction and ideas about the remodeling and we were very happy with that because we knew that this is what we need and want. Ziv and his team were extremely detailed oriented people and they surpassed all the anticipations with the finished kitchen. Each day we saw how our remodeling project is moving forward and how friendly and hardworking people the team were. Unlike past experiences… We didn’t have to worry if the workers will show up each morning to work. The American home improvement working people were on top of our remodeling project and we can’t thank them enough. We do recommend them!!!"
5,"I hired American home improvement to finally bring the backyard of my house to life. The empty lot in the back yard was the same way I got it when I purchased the new house from the builder and all it had was just dirt. This project was pretty challenging because of the semi small space, shaped and slightly irregular. American home improvement was able to provide me with several estimates and options and all of this in order to help me get the ‘feeling’ of prices based on several levels of items and quality in hard-scape, soft-scape and lighting. This method of service allowed me to make better choices on areas to enhance or compromise in order to stay within budget. My past experiences with landscapers was not good and it made it harder for me to make a decision in hiring anyone to this project. My past experience showed me that whoever you hire, they will be either good at one thing or not that good at the other one, rarely can you find someone that will be goo in both AND mostly they never finish anything when they say they're going to. My experience with American home improvement was completely different and positive. Ben was especially knowledgeable about both hard and soft-scape and provided intuitively good recommendations. Sure thing but like any job, there will always be few problems, but Ben was fair enough and responsive, working diligently to come to a resolution we were both happy with. I was most impressed with the professionalism and hardworking ethic of the actual crew that did the work. They arrived on time every day, were polite and cleaned up after themselves each day. They take pride in their work and it shows. American home improvement did such a good job. I will hire them again for any future landscaping needs."
5,"Based on several recommendations and help from friends about this company, I decided to go ahead and hire American home improvement to remodel my 2 bathrooms and kitchen. During each one of the steps in the remodIsaacng, Isaac (the owner) informed me and communicate with me about what is happening , what is going to happened and he always responded to my emails, calls or even texts and my feedback about some of the things that the workers did that day or about to do. The teams at American home improvement that worked at my house, did a great job as well and they put a lot of attention in order to make everything in perfect condition and without mistakes, thanks to Juan and all of the others.  Even when there were issues or concerns from my end, Isaac and the workers were always willing to make it right or to explain to me why it needed to be that way. Isaac and Jacob (his partner) were very helpful and have even provided advice and assistance on other construction issues unrelated to their work. I would not hesitate to recommend American home improvement for any large construction jobs and will definitely be using them again whenever I have another project."
5,Finding a contractor for me was the most stressful part of the remodeling. I have contacted a lot of companies knowing I will be investing on my savings. I can never seem to find a company I can trust & I just couldn’t click with their reps until I found American Home Improvement. My project manager asked the right questions & I felt that what really mattered was for me to get what I want for the price I can afford. He made sure we stay within the budget & what was more important was that he delivered from beginning to end. I was not disappointed at all. Highly recommend this company.
5,"My experience with AHI couldn’t be any better. With a little hesitation because of budget issues, I called this company from a local
Magazine for an estimate. I was very impressed how knowledgeable the project manager was. He gave me different options & ideas & helped me from A to Z get a loan with the terms I can be comfortable with to actually do the outdoor remodeling I’ve always wanted. Now I have a brand new patio & a backyard done very professionally. I am very pleased with my experience & will certainly call them for my next home project."
5,"My home is over 10 years old and we finally decided to do a kitchen update. I hired American home improvement to design and implement the new kitchen and make it practical for us. Isaac came up with a great design of the kitchen and he actually took the time to listen to us and to truly understand our needs. Isaac and his workers on top of his sub-contractors, worked together in a professional manner to deliver the kitchen I wanted and the result are wonderful. His crew were always on time and I was overwhelmed with the schedule and the daily tasks routine they had and mostly the cleaning at the end of each day. When the remodeling was completed, I noticed of several problems. I called Isaac at American home improvement and he came out right away and fixed them all. We are now thinking of hiring them again to remodel the bathrooms at our house."
5,"I highly recommend American home improvement to for any quality of home remodeling and dealing with creative, professionals and skilled people. I wanted add an additional space to my bedroom that will have a powder room and a larger bathroom in my house. I came to American home improvement with a global concept of what I wanted to achieve. Shlomo worked with me hand by hand to make the addition and to enlarge the bathroom and to recreate the closet space while remodeling the bathroom and powder room the way I wanted it to be. I trusted the working team from the very early stage of the work but the completed remodeling project is much more beautiful than what I had anticipated! Shlomo did a great work by redesigning and polished the original design (master bathroom and powder room) that feel large, relaxed and lovely. The crew that executed this remodeling was excellent as well. Even our guests and family stated on how enjoyable and trained they were! The work took a little longer than it should (which is normal to my opinion) but Shlomo communicated with me often and provided me with weekly updates and detailed explanations of the work progress and what left to be done. I am hoping to remodel the kitchen in the near future and I’m looking forward to hire American home improvement again."
5,"We had a great pleasure to hire and allow American home improvement to work at our house and Mae and the workers for the recent kitchen and guest bathroom remodeling. I write this review based on our experience only of hiring them. Mickey and Mae did a great job at the kitchen mainly and Mae made it go easy and smoothly. The main points according to our experience with them were:
1. Very well organized company and structured. The workers and Mickey showed up to the house each day during the week and they arrived on time and on the little times that they didn’t show up due to things such as deliveries etc.…  they always gave us notice ahead of time which was important. 
2. All the communication between the office (Mae), Mickey and the workers were excellent. They didn't make any mistakes and were able to do everything in good and professional manner. We expected to have some errors and delays but I we were just lucky and we didn’t have any. 
3. Price wise - They were a bit more expensive than the other bids we received but the effort and care they put into our project was well worth it. Sometimes you just have to go with your instinct and choosing with them was one of the best decisions we made."
5,"We got in touch with American home improvement about doing several things at our house. We wanted to have them paint the house, replace the windows with a double sided glass and add 2 patio doors that will give us a bigger opening space from the house to the back yard and to rebuilt the kitchen. We wanted to replace the faces of the kitchen cabinet doors and to give it a new look while keeping the existing layout of it. Isaac was able to provide us with the best deal and our research about the company gave us the final approve to hire them. While we worked on the kitchen with Isaac and his people, we decided to do additional things at the house that we thought it will be a good idea to do them while we do the kitchen project as well. The windows that we Isaac replace for us were a double glass windows with special film (UV film). In the patio, we wanted to have bigger opening that will allow us to be inside the house while getting the feeling of being outside. Isaac's people did a perfect job on that too. The last item that we did was to paint the house inside and also some touch ups outside. Isaac brought to the house several people that came over and worked area by area and making sure that we can live at the rest of the house. The work came out better than we thought and we are extremely pleased with our decision to hire American home improvement and mainly to work with Isaac."
5,"Many thanks to American Home Improvement and mainly Mark and the actual people that were involved in our remodeling, for the excellent remodeling job that they did at our house. The remodeling project included the full remodeling of our house and it included the kitchen. Bathrooms, back yard, front yard, bedrooms and hallways. The work changed completely the house and we love it very much! Mark and his crew did such a professional work and each part of it was done with extra care and attention. During the work and even after, Mark was there for us to answer any of our questions or concerns, meeting us at various vendors and helped us selecting and choosing all the materials, appliances and paint. He used his skills and experience to advise us on all the many available options for many issues that raised during the work! We would refer American Home Improvement to anyone looking to convert their house space into something stunning!"
5,"Shlomo did a wonderful job when we hired him and his people to renovate our house. We hired him to execute our designed plans that we did with another design firm. The design plans were to remodel our kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms, laundry room and living room on top of the dining room area as well. Shlomo at American Home Improvement and their several subcontractors that were hired for our remodeling in order to do the electricity, plumbing and custom kitchen cabinets, were able to bring the design to life with an amazing skills and special attention to all the small details which made this remodeling project a huge success and very beautiful. During the work, we noticed very clear how the working crew and the subcontractors were easygoing and skilled with several modifications that came up due to unknown problems that arises during the work and all of them were communicating with us when they happen. We look forward to working with them again in the future."
5,"We were having Shlomo working at our house for the remodeling project that we needed to do for a while now. He met and sat with us several times of different days planning and describing their process and services. Our remodeling project was to do a new kitchen, master bathroom, master bedroom walk-in closet and replacing the old HVAC system with new one. Shlomo and Ben managed our project together and they started with measuring the existing areas of the house which allow them to come up with a design a week after. Each detail of the project was analyzed and discussed to mainly cover the cost and time frame for each task such as: appliances, countertops, cabinet style and colors etc. and the time frame that required for installing the new HVAC system from their sub-contractor. While close to half of the house was under work, American home improvement took every protection they could to cover the rest of the house from the dust and debris so we can live at the house for the time been and they made us a temporary kitchen. Each detail and part of the remodeling was supervised by both of them. The working team were very professional and skilled, from the electrician, the plumber, tile man and the painter. They all worked flawlessly together and involved us with each step of the work. Each one of them took pride in his own trade which ended in a beautiful kitchen and bathrooms that we enjoy just by looking at them. American home improvement finished our remodeling project on time and a little bit below our agreed budget and we look forward to hire them again. We highly recommend American home improvement to anyone considering a remodel."
5,"We recently worked with Shlomo to paint my house inside and out. I purchased this house recently and the house needed to get a fresh look and makeover. Shlomo came by the house several times in order to define each space at the house for any color combination and texture in the common areas. What I loved about her was that she was able to get a great idea of what needed to be done. The color combinations and textures, were so impressive and beautiful that the samples of them could prove that immediately. From all the samples that she was able to do with her painters, it was super easy to imagine how it will look like and the process was very easy. In the outside of the house, her color combinations made the same effect and this was the killer point that caused me to hire her and the team of painters from American home improvement. One of the main problems that I had, was all the furniture and items that I had at the house. Shlomo was able to solve that immediately by assigning 3 people that came to the house prior to the painters and they moved all the furniture and cover them so it will be ready for the painters to do the actual paint. The whole work went smoothly and without any problem which made me very happy and proud at myself that I hired the right company for the job. I felt that Shlomo really understood my style and she did all she could to make this on the easiest way and with completely perfection. She really listened to what I was looking for and saved me a lot of time and stress. If I wasn’t hired Shlomo or contact American home improvement, I'm sure I would still be not able to find any other paint company that could make my house this way."
5,"We hired Daniel from American home improvement to paint the exterior of our home after using another painting company painted the interior of our home, which we were not satisfied with. During our meetings with Daniel and with his senior painter, we felt that he was honest, professional and really easy to communicate with. Daniel showed us his past homes he'd done in the past, which were amazing, but he was also open to our new ideas (that we saw or got from other places and magazines). When you are getting bids for exterior painting, you want people who are open to jobs that are creative and maybe a little more time consuming, but stunning when completed. That is exactly how Daniel is; he's allows you the time to walk the property and visualize what it could look like. He listens to you and actually paints things the way you want. Besides having a wealth of experience and knowledge, he is considerate of how a person feels about their home. He recognizes that to the buyer of services, the outcome of the services mean something to the homeowners. That's a very rare thing to find. He gave us a great quote and an excellent timeframe, and he stuck to it; even when he pointed out to us that we might consider a darker shade around our windows (that he had already painted!). In the end, we loved the paint colors and the way he made our house the most beautiful on the block. He was so easy to work with, he kept his word on everything we agreed on, and he showed up every day, on time!! His professionalism is unparalleled as far as I'm concerned. My neighbors noticed too; they had Daniel paint their houses as well! I am more than happy to recommend Daniel's work to anyone who is interested in having their home or business done. He is awesome!"
5,"We just finished our kitchen remodeling project and we have to write here that American home improvement did a great job and they beat our anticipations! While we were seating and talking about the technical aspects of the remodeling, David (our project manager) told us that the project will take anytime between 1.5 moths to 2 months at most and during that time, the workers and the sub-contractors will work on a daily basis making sure that everything will be done. Our expectations regarding the remodeling was that it will pass that time because they had to do so much and we thought that this time will not be enough. In fact, the workers did came each day to the house and they arrived on time while working very hard. The remodeling was completed in exactly a month and 5 days! We still cannot believe how they could finish it in such period of time, and in a great results. This great experience insured them that we will hire them again in the future for any additional work that we might do and we will never hire someone else other than American home improvement because they are skilled, professional and they do care about the satisfaction of their customers while focusing on what the client want before offering anything. We do recommend them to whoever needs any remodeling for their house or office."
5,"My mom asked me to help her find a contractor to remodel her bathroom & after seeing at least 5 contractors I decided to go with American home improvement. For one, they were the only company who I felt that was sincere to my moms needs & my gut feeling was right. My mom did not have any unpleasant experience throughout the whole ordeal. The workers were great & respectful & did a great job. Most of all she loves her new bathroom. She's considering on doing her kitchen sometime soon & she will definitely use them again."
5,"Shlomo was the American home improvement project manager for the recent kitchen and bathroom renovation that we recently did and his team of skilled and hardworking did a wonderful job. We greatly recommend American home improvement and mainly Mike, The working crew and the office staff that was involved in our project and we will hire them again for any additional remodeling project in our house. Shlomo was the project manager on both remodeling projects (kitchen and bathroom), did a perfect designing job for the kitchen space by using most of the existing space with features that we needed and wanted for a while now. From start to end, the extra attention that Shlomo put to all the details of both projects was more than what we were looking for. He always gave wonderful ideas and suggestions and he made sure that we are happy with all the decisions about both renovations. We love both projects very much! The kitchen and the bathroom got a completely brand new look and they are very functional for our needs. It makes us very happy each time any of us walk into any of them!"
5,"American home improvement and Daniel, did a great job by remodeling our bathroom. The group of workers came to our house every morning, on time and stayed till they were able to finish the work scheduled for that day. They completed what Daniel planned for them to do for that day and then they came back the following morning to continue the work under the supervision of Daniel. All the people that were involved in our project, were hardworking people and they were always on top of things even when issues came up – they were able to solve them while keeping the budget. The bathroom remodeling project was finished on the time frame that Daniel gave us before we hired him. 
We met and talked to Daniel few times before we made our final decision and that was because we wanted to be sure that we got the best deal and that they will be able to finish the work without any problem. Daniel was very nice to us and he was very easy person to work with. He explained us everything that was belong to the project and he was very pleasant man to talk to. We are very happy with Tibi home remodeling and if we ever decide on doing another remodeling project we would definitely hire them again."
5,"After four estimates I decided to hire American home improvement to do my kitchen remodeling. Isaac from American home improvement, came over to our house for the first scheduled meeting that we arranged with the office and he was very experienced with the process of the kitchen remodeling and he was able to answer each one of the questions we had. For the second meeting, He showed up and he brought a 3D design of how the new kitchen will look like which it was exactly the way we wanted our kitchen to look like after the remodeling project will be over. Isaac was also great when it came to the estimate because he gave us a realistic quote for the work and during the work, it was so easy to communicate with him by phone, text of via the office. When it come to the way they worked, we must admit that we are satisfied with that too because they at the end of each day, they kept the kitchen space clean and they used all kind of protection materials to keep all the dust and debris separate from the rest of the living spaces of the house during the whole construction so the house won’t get messy and dirty. We didn’t have to keep informing them about it and that showed us how they really care about us. Very reliable company, we will definitely use them again."
5,"American home improvement is definitely a top quality landscape and hardscape Construction Company and I highly recommend them for everyone that is interesting in a high quality & qualified landscape work. We met Daniel for the first time last year after we purchased our first house in LA area. We were impressed by his amount of understanding, expertise and sense of concept. He understood right away what we wanted to have and he was able to gather a great design draft of the front and back yard of the house including a detailed estimate. Due to limits in our overall budget, we ended up doing our back-yard first. Daniel’s team worked at the house from the beginning as promised and they completed the work on the projected achievement time. The crew appeared each day at the house and worked tough in order to keep the work as scheduled. The crew was managed by Carlos who is a professional foreman, pretty detail motivated person and responsive to our comments. We were so happy by the work they did, that a year after we hired Daniel to do the front yard. Also this time the work that they did was excellent. Daniel and his team truly converted our house and improved the value of our house. We recently moved to a bigger house and we decided to rent the other house that American home improvement had remodel the landscaping for. When we purchased the house, the front and back yard was remodeled by another contractor (that was done by the previous owner) and that work was too bad and horrible. The backyard concrete was so bad, that we had to remove all the concrete and pour new one. We called Daniel as we decided to redo this whole backyard. We knew that we can trust on Daniel’s opinion on how to fix all the problems. We appreciate the quality of work of Daniel and his team at American home improvement. We look forward to have Daniel do the front yard in in new house too and we will hire him for any future remodeling projects. We highly recommend Daniel and American home improvement for all of your landscape needs."
5,"We hired American home improvement to remodel and upgrade all 3 bathrooms and 4 bedrooms at our house. The remodeling included paint with new colors and texture, the replacement of all the windows with new ones and we added few benches in the shower areas. After that, we replaced all the vanities and added in-wall storage cabinets including all the crown molding around. On top of that, they painted all the bedrooms at the house and tear down all the wall paper around the house. In the kitchen area we replaced the existing appliances with new ones, while adding the back splash tiles, new paint and new LED lightings. New light fixtures were installed in the family room and living room. The house looks very good and beautiful! American home improvement did everything they promised and even few more things that were added in the middle of the work. I will hire them again in the future for my next remodeling project. Thank you American home improvement!"
5,"It’s been a while since I wanted to remodel my house and mainly my kitchen. After a massive research for a construction company, I decided to hire American home improvement and to have them do the remodeling. At first I met with Shlomo and we discussed about the options and what can I do for the amount that I can spend. Shlomo came up with his plan and I just loved it. He then was able to generate a price that did fit my budget and I gave my permission for the work. Now that my kitchen is completed, I can state that hiring American home improvement for the remodeling was in fact the best decision I have made and they are the most reasonable construction company that do have a great customer service and they are very professional. Shlomo did not try to push anything sell me any extra things. More than that he put my budget as the main priority thing. I will definitely recommend Shlomo and American home improvement for any remodeling project."
5,"This is the second time I have used American home improvement for a remodeling at my house and as I was very happy in the first remodeling, this time was even better and I’m happier with the new kitchen. The new kitchen remodeling that Tammy and his people did for us included the replacement of the wood floor with new travertine one, new upper and lower cabinets, new appliances, lighting fixtures, home automated switches and outlets, new counter top with back splash and new plumbing too. The workmanship is outstanding, the attention to details and even to the smallest ones was remarkable and they refer me to some great sources for kitchen appliances, travertine, marble slabs and more. Like the last time of the remodeling, Tammy handled all the minor extras that I wanted to do or change during the work without any complain and with a smile on his face. I will hire them again next year for my master bathroom and bedroom remodeling project."
5,"I hired Daniel at American home improvement on two complete bathrooms remodeling project including the kitchen at my house and I was very happy with how it went and mainly came out! Daniel and Whitney are both wonderful people to work with and it was very useful to have them both do the design and execute it into reality with the amount of expertise they have which made this remodeling a huge success for me. Daniel did a marvelous job by listening and understanding my design goals and balancing them with his design skills to come up with a productive, functional and within budget work. Whitney was everything I needed for this remodeling from the paperwork aspect of it. She made sure that billing, permits, materials orders and deliveries will be smooth and will arrive on time so the work will keep moving as agreed. Daniel’s devotion to all types of details was something that I didn’t think I can see in this remodeling. At the end, my high anticipations were exceeded and I have received many great compliments on how excellent the bathrooms and kitchen looks. I highly recommend American home improvement and I will for sure hire them again in the future!"
5,"Working with AHI was such a great experience! They were skilled, trustworthy and professional. They offered different options and ideas for our kitchen remodeling project.  They worked within our budget and we are very pleased with the result!"
5,"American home improvement planned and designed our outdoor living space and executed it after we approved all the changed and modifications so it will fit exactly to what we wanted to have. At first, we honestly didn’t think that we can get all what we wanted under our budget because it was just too many things in one project. The project that we wanted to do, included a 2 levels patio with space for full BBQ with dining area, sink, refrigerator, counter top and a large stone fire pit with seating area. More than that, we added some plantings spots by building a plats pots, a new grass area, LED solar lighting fixtures, a new driveway and more things. We’ve met and interviewed many contractors and home improvement companies and landscapers over the last few months and none of them was able to compete to Isaac’s experience, quality and promise to ensure their work with our expectations. Each one of them had something that caused us to move to the next one in our list and when we met with Isaac, we felt that this is the right person for us and for our project. He was very respectful, hardworking and neat. We are proud that we selected this company from all the rest and because of our great experience, we highly recommend American home improvement and Isaac including all the office staff that was involved in our house project."
5,"When my wife & I purchased our home, we have probably met at least 5 contractors to bid on our major remodeling because our new house needed a lot of work. We were very skeptical on hiring anyone considering the amount of work that we needed to do with a tight budget. Most of the contractors we talked to didn't give us a lot of options & the prices we got were just outrageous. Then we finally saw American Home Improvement & since they were local to us we decided to give it another shot. For the first time when we met with one of their project managers, he was the only representative who listened to what we actually really needed & told us that he would work with our budget. We had minor issues during the construction stage but my project manager was always there to make sure he addresses every concerns & issues that we have. The workers were professional & polite which is for me the most important thing. If I also need to call their office for whatever reason the personnel were always accommodating & friendly as well. Overall we had a great experience with this company but most importantly, we love our new home -- the quality of work was great & I'm really really happy I decided to go with American Home Improvement. That's why I'm taking this time to share my experience & they definitely deserve to be recommended & rated 5 stars!"
5,"After the results of the final remodeling project that we got from American home improvement, we can write here that we couldn’t have asked for anything better starting with a skilled team or people or a better finished bathroom and Kitchen remodeling project! From the very early meeting that we had and all the way to the last cleaning, Mickey and his team were totally brilliant. Mickey was most helpful in coming up with the right decisions for our goals, he was clear, straightforward and honest about each stage of the work including the small details. They all were on time, respectful, and professional. They took extra care and attention in making sure that everything will be covered before starting to work and completely clean area before they left for the day and most of all when they complete the entire project. We had a master bathroom and a brand new designed kitchen that was worth each and every penny. We highly recommend American home improvement and Mainly Mickey to anyone who is currently looking to have any type of a remodeling project done. We sure that it will be everything and anything you were looking for while being delivered by a skilled and professional team who really prove a commitment to customer satisfaction and a job well done!"
5,"Working with Michael and his crew at American home improvement was a great experience. All of them were honest, skilled and professional. Prior to hiring them, we got few other estimates and American home improvement one was detailed, clear to understand and fairly priced. Michael took the time to get over the entire remodeling, explaining us everything and unlike other companies no one from them pressured us or tried misleading. We were very happy to do business with them and we valued that Michael and his crew were great communicators and all the meetings and completion date were all on time. Michael managed the entire kitchen remodeling and there we had no surprises or extras charges. It went very smooth than we thought and we are more than happy with the new kitchen. It looks beautiful and very functional. We will recommend them to anyone! Mainly Michael at American home improvement."
5,"American home improvement is for sure a Top Notch construction company! Daniel is an excellent person that care a lot for the happiness of his clients while making sure to bring any remodeling come true with extra attention to perfection and details. He is well organized and very strict on the project timing. He met with us several times before we even got the design of the remodeling project, the meetings were mainly for him to listen and understand what we really want to get from this project and after he understood that part, he start to share his ideas that were basically an improvement to ours. His crew of skilled people were very polite, making sure to keep all the area clean and neat as much as they could, dealing with any issue that came up during the work right away. All of the people that were involved at this project, we responsive to any of our comments and questions and they fixed anything and everything. We couldn’t be more pleased with the remodeling project that they did (a complete kitchen remodeling) and with Daniel’s supervision. We do trust this company and we will hire them for any future projects at our home."
5,"Daniel including the crew of workers from American home improvement recently completed a major remodeling at our house and they assisted us understand how the construction process should go, and helped us to achieve what we wanted and still stay within the budget that we had before the work while producing our new kitchen and bathrooms as we imagined for a while now. Daniel worked with us closely from the begging by drafting a design as a starting point and presented us the prices for step of the work, time frame for completion, and more... We definitely felt that he knew what he is doing and that was very easy to realize. Two things that really set American home improvement from the rest of the contractors that we came across with was that they were very clear about the work, more expert about the construction process and dedicated to our happiness. Thank you American home improvement - we could not be happier."
5,"We were looking to remodel our vacation house early of this year, and we wanted to create a brand new and functional living space that provided us an open layout and flow. Our budget was pretty fixed and we needed someone that will be able to do it within that amount. Together with Michel, we were able to create a perfect solution that allowed us to open up most of the kitchen wall and generating an additional opening that finally now can allow us to move and work on both sides of our Kitchen Island. All of our family fell in love with the new space and we enjoy cooking and entertaining all of our guests and family that come over from time to time. We are very happy and satisfied that our friends were able to refer us to American home improvement and are very fascinated by their amount of experience and craftsmanship. By working and dealing with Michel, we can state clearly that he was able to take away all the stress and worries of this big change for our house and he was able to turn our kitchen into something much better and larger than we ever imagined."
5,"This year we purchased a ""fixer"" on in a community near our main house. We have completed several remodeling projects over the last 20 years, all gradually more powerful and all as an owner-builder. Since this was the most challenging project, we decided to go with a company that can design and do the actual remodeling rather than hiring an architect and then searching for a bid from general contractors. We thought that we can have a bigger effect on the design and to create an efficiency by using a good team to reach the milestones together and shortening the process. Michael from American home improvement, has verified to be the perfect choice for us and he was able to start the work immediately after we closed escrow. We worked hand by hand in the initial design stage using 3D designs, floor plans and elevations drawn by Michelle presenting to us several choices and making changes on the way. After this process was completed, Michelle’s team produced for us the necessary plans and handled all the permits. 
Our contract was in two parts:
-First part ‘Design’
-Second part remodeling’ 
We were very happy and satisfied with the cost of the design, mainly because it included a promise of a good discount in case we go with American home improvement for the second part. When we decided to hire them for the second part, we were so happy with the quality and effort that American home improvement did for us that the discount was not that important no more. Michelle earned the additional benefit! This was a large project so keeping a sharp pencil has been critical in establishing costs within the budget. Michelle worked closely with us and allowed us to save the cost by making the project possible. It has been only three weeks since the remodeling was completed, but our years of experience in remodeling, we can see that our decision was well made. No struggle was wasted and there is no doubts about all the different teams of workers that worked on this remodeling."
5,"We had a truly excellent experience with American home improvement. Our remodeling project was to take down completely the old kitchen, rebuild it and remodel our 2 bedrooms, bathrooms and living room including the laundry room. The work started on the day and time that was set during our meetings with Jason and it was done on the day and time (with few days after due to some minor delays in the delivery of some materials) and it mainly stayed on our budget. The team of Jason listened to our comments and questions and they were very responsive to the approved design plan. They were very reliable, careful, and professional people. They were easygoing people to work with and to have in our house every day. Jason was able to make this remodeling project as easy as possible even though sometimes it was hard because all the problems that were raised during the work. I highly recommend American home improvement."
5,"Our recent experience with American home improvement and especially with Daniel was very good. We hired them to do a complete remodeling of our kitchen. Daniel was able to provide us with a great design that contained most things we wanted, custom cabinets, new flooring, granite counter tops and the relevant appliances (Ref, Dishwasher, stove and hood). Daniel and his people were able to finish the new kitchen in less than a month and the new kitchen came out the way we wanted and even more. What we mostly appreciate is that the overall price was within our budget and even though we did some changes during the work, Daniel did all he could in order to not add any hidden charges."
5,"I never imagined that my kitchen remodeling can be completely very fast and in a fairly price! Mickey and Elad were honest the whole time, consistent, supportive and just easy people to deal with. Before hiring them, I got several estimates and they were all higher than the one I got from Mickey. Their estimate also included more things than the other contractors such as higher quality of materials and home automation features such as outlets, lightings and thermostat. As part of the remodeling, Mickey was able to give me great suggestions on what I can and should include into the design of the kitchen and into the final product. I am very satisfied with the whole thing! Mickey went with me to his local vendors where I purchased the items I needed for the kitchen (flooring, tiles, countertops, handles, back splash and more…) – I can't say enough good things about them!"
5,"I am very pleased with the work that was performed by Mickey and his team. A friend recommended me to hire American home improvement for my house remodeling after he heard about the problem I’m currently having with the contractor that I just hired for my house in which caused me several problems at the beginning of the remodeling. After I called their office, Mickey called me and came over to my house the next day, checked and reviewed the work that was done and what still need to be completed while focusing on several problems that were caused by the previous one.  Few days later, he came back once again and presented to me his complete and fairly priced estimate on the entire work that still needed to be done in order to finish it. After our lawyer took care of the other contractor, I went ahead and hired Mickey to step in and finish the work. Mickey started to work few days after and his team came over to the house and started the work. Mickey came over the house each day to supervise the workers and to make sure that everything is going according to the plan while oversee the workers. He even did some of the work himself and the work was performed in a professional way, quick, polite and professional. I am very happy with the entire remodeling job of my kitchen, bathroom, entry, dining room and bathrooms and I strongly recommend them."
5,"Our house had a big water damage emergency and we were in a search for someone that will be able to bring all the damage spaces in the house so we can move back to our home. What we needed to do was to remodel the dining room, kitchen, powder room and the guest room including 2 bathrooms. On top of it, we needed to install new hardwood floor all around the first floor and to replace some light fixtures. The kitchen remodeling was the most complex one because it included the replacement of all the cabinets, counter-tops, sink, appliances, back-splash and all the finishing items. All the people that did the actual work at our house were professional, polite and hardworking. American home improvement did an amazing job and it was a pleasure to work and dealt with. The complete restoration project was done in a very timely manner. We definitely hire them again."
5,"We cannot write enough words about how happy are we with our kitchen remodeling that was done by American home improvement and managed by Daniel and his team of workers. His tremendous he started by helping us selecting the cabinets for the kitchen, floors, tiles, marble counter tops and all the finishing items such as the handles and more… more than that, all the office staff that were involved too, were very professional and polite during the entire work. In addition to that, the sub-contractors and vendors were also professional, experts, knowledgeable and honest in their tasks. The remodeling was finished on time and within our budget. They were well-ordered and the house was cleaned up after each day of work before they left the house for the day. We could not be happier and the new kitchen is absolutely gorgeous. More than all the above, Daniel didn’t try to either pressure us to sign any contract or to push us to add more items that we don’t need."
5,"Our remodeling project started with the wrong company that we hired for our second story addition and a complete first floor remodel on our 1100 sq./ft. house. When this happened, we left with a house that was unlivable. The walls were out of plumbing pipe, beams were missing and in a total complete mess. One of our friends recommended us to hire several companies that can come and finish the work but in the end, we felt that this will cause more and more problems. As our search kept going, we came across American home improvement and when we met with them at the house, we spoke to Daniel and told him what we want and if it can be done. Daniel came back to us few days after with a plan on how to take over and to complete the work so we can move in and start to enjoy our new house. While Daniel and his team did their plans and suggestions, we did more and more research about them because we wanted to be sure that our house will be completed. After all of our additional meetings with Daniel, We decided that we will hire them and we went forward with our remodeling project. Daniel and his teams of skilled people rebuilt our house in a better way than it should have been done from the beginning. He was able to combine his skills and vision in order to deliver outstanding product. The house came out much more beyond our expectations. He visited the house on a daily basis and managed the crews on top of ordering all the materials and scheduling all the subcontractors that worked at the house as well. Now that the house is complete and we already moved to the house, we can mention that our house is the evidence that they know how to take any remodeling project and to complete it while making the clients happy and without any stress. American home improvement price was very reasonable for the work that they did on our home. We truly hope that no one will have to go thru our first experience, but if they do... than they need to make sure to hire the right contractor that will be able to complete any remodeling project. American home improvement is a company that I would hire again without reservation."
5,"My husband & I hired American home improvement back in 2014 and we were pleased with the results of the work that they did at our previous house. This time, we hired them once again to do a remodeling of our kitchen and bathrooms at our new house and Sam & his team of skilled people were again amazing people. They all came to work on time & Sam made sure to keep everything under budget. The scope of this remodeling just increased our trust and appreciation in American home improvement. On top of the kitchen and bathrooms remodeling, we also painted the house inside & out, got rid of all the popcorn ceilings throughout the house & added LED lights too. Sam is a professional, designer & great listener. He heard us in order for not only understanding what we want but helping us make our vision come true. Our house is now what we really knew it could be. Thank you Sam & your wonderful team for this great remodeling at our house.  We thank Sam & everyone at American home improvement! We have already recommended them to several friends."
5,"We give Ziv and David (from American home improvement) a A+ rating for the remodeling project that they did for us.
 The remodeling project involved the kitchen which includes: 
-Installing granite counters
-New back-splash and cabinets
-Relocating and installing the new stove and sink 
-Installing new lighting system.
 In addition to the kitchen, they did other few projects in other parts of the house like:
-Raising the entry ceiling.
-Putting in new doors, etc. 
We adore the completed remodeling every day since it was completed a month ago. We found American home improvement on the internet and we asked them to meet with us about in regards to the kitchen. We were fascinated with their knowledge, and design ideas. While they prepared the proposal, Ziv came over to the house more than once and meet with us before we signed the contract. Once we started the work, we valued his capability to manage the project. They met with us at the cabinet maker’s shop where we saw several cabinet Designs, and they assist us with all the details. Ziv did a great job with all his communications with us and with all the other people involved. Ziv and the whole crew were friendly and great workers. They followed through on all fronts and exceeded our expectations. We are very happy with the final outcome and give our highest praises to American home improvement."
5,"After a big research that we did that included meetings and interviews several of them, we ended up hiring American home improvement. Isaac was assigned to us as the manager for the project and the supervisor for the crew. He was professional and straightforward with the costs. His communication skills were great and he was available for us to answer all of our questions and ideas. This showed us how he was passionate and eager to get the job right and not below than perfection. After Isaac presented us with the designs, we set and run numbers to see how can we fir everything within our budget. Surprisingly enough, Isaac was able to fit 90% of our vision into the budget so the decision to go ahead with the work was finalized and set. More than that, American home improvement was able to share with us the cost of the design which made it much better for us because we could add more items to the remodeling. Our remodeling project was to renovate the entire kitchen and to replace all the appliances and flooring. We want to thank Jacob and the rest of American home improvement for everything they did for us."
5,"After a long time of research and interviewing several companies, I hired this company to do the work. The work started with several meetings with Mickey and we spoke on what to do and how to do including the styles, relocation of the refrigerator and the time scheduling. Mickey managed this whole thing and he had his crew working each day while reporting to him about their progress. The first week of work was demolition the old kitchen and prepare the space for the installation of the cabinets. During the whole work, we had no problem with them or with the communications between us to Mickey or his office. I’m happy with the new kitchen and with the work that they did."
5,"I had a very good experience working with American home improvement. I worked with a Shlomo who was my project manager and he was very resourceful and skilled person. When I met with him, he brought several samples of similar projects that he did recently and he shared with me many ideas that could fit to my remodeling while he was very focused to what I wanted. During the second and third meeting that we had, he went over with me on all the details of the work and even brought a digital design of how the new kitchen will look like after the remodeling! The final kitchen remodeling was exactly like the design he had designed. The cost of it was fair and good and I never got the feeling that he is trying to add more money to the work or by making any short cuts. They had very skilled working crew as well and they were able to complete the kitchen remodeling in a very fairly time!"
5,"I hired American home for a remodel of my guest house and addition of a master suite, I couldn't be happier with the work they did. My project manager Shawn was always available to answer my questions and the work turned out better than I imagined."
5,Excellent job!! American Home Improvement has done an incredible work remodeling my kitchen! I could not be any happier with the work done. It completely changed the look of my house! I highly recommend this company!!
5,"Working with Shawn was great, after visiting their location and meeting the  staff I felt very comfortable with my decision to remodel. 

The process wasn't always easy but Shawn made it easy for us to live in the home during construction. The workers were very polite and the projects were completed on time and I couldn't be happier."
5,"American home improvement helped me remodel and completely make my home energy efficient and made it affordable for my family to do so with a energy efficiency financing option. All of the employees there knew how to guide me and answer all of my questions during the project. I have a new roof, texcoat and windows. I was also able to upgrade my electrical panel and will be having solar panels installed in the next few months."
5,"Great working with this contractor, my bathroom needed some serious work and we found mold in the process of demilolition. Jeff did his best to keep the cost reasonable and the project was completed at our satisfaction."
5,"I'm very happy with the results of the work performed by American home improvement, the kitchen looks spectacular and I couldn't be happier with the crew and Micky my project manager very responsive with all my concerns and questions during the process."
5,Victoria and Mike kept us up to date all  on the details progress of the kitchen remodel and living room update. Victoria's vision fit the house and what we were looking for in a new kitchen. She was always quick to answer any question we had. They worked around us being in the house. The electricians worked past midnight on one occasion trying to solve a problem that turned out to be a power company issue.  Very happy with the outcome of the remodel and have gotten many compliments on the change.
5,"Laura at S & W Kitchens was fantastic to work with, she listened and deigned my perfect kitchen! I absolutely love my kitchen!"
5,"From start to finish, S&W did a fantastic job on our kitchen, bedroom and bathroom remodel!  From Traci, the designer, to Kevin, the Project Manager, they were always on top of things and extremely responsive and communicative.  Would definitely use S&W again for any future remodeling!"
5,"We chose S&W Kitchens to renovate our guest bathroom.  This extremely small bath had all original fixtures dating back 34 years.  We began the process in October 2021 by visiting the Longwood design center.  Later we called to schedule an estimate and they paired us with Sarah.  From start to finish on this project Sarah has been amazing.  Since this was our first remodel she walked us through the entire process never hesitating to answer all our questions.  

She never tried to persuade us in any one direction on colors, tile or fixture selection.  Being new to this process we would ask for her design opinions and she was always honest and upfront about each item.  Sarah corresponded with us on multiple occasions throughout the life of this renovation to ensure all was going as planned and to inquire about any of our questions, comments or concerns.  

Throughout the life of this renovation there were a number of contractors who came to work on this project:  plumbers, concrete cutters, a framer, tile installers, painters, drywall installers, electrician, threshold installers and delivery personnel.  All of these contractors were highly skilled in their field.  All the contractors on our project were very respectful to us and even cleaned the work area before leaving each day.  

Our renovation took three months from the start of construction.  In all, a total of 35 days from the first home visit to the last walk-thru.  We are so extremely pleased with all the quality work which has been done throughout the course of the project.  We have a beautiful guest bathroom to enjoy for years to come.    

Sarah was our rockstar!  She is so kind, patient and puts the client first.  She is easy to talk to and discuss ideas and appears to really enjoy her work.  We will definitely request Sarah for our next renovation."
4,"We recently finished our master bathroom remodel with Sarah Kraus, and now we're starting on the guest bathroom. Sarah was fabulous! In addition to her detailed design work, Sarah was patient, kind and responsive to emails and phone calls. Best of all, she was an advocate for us when we had workmanship questions or concerns. That's the primary reason we chose to work with her again."
5,"We just had our first experience with remodeling our kitchen and S&W Palm Harbor did not disappoint! Shirley Aguilu, project designer, and Steve Cota, superintendent, are outstanding...their knowledge, guidance and patience throughout the project made the experience very pleasant. We had many questions since this was our first remodel and they were friendly, trustworthy and responsive. Everyone including the contractors and installers had an impressive attention to detail and their workmanship was top notch! We are so thrilled with the end result and highly recommend them!!"
1,"We hired them Feb 2021 to remodel two bathrooms and outdoor grill. Absolute disaster! Attached is what our master bathroon looks like now April 2022. We have finally come to the point where we had to make a claim against our insurance. Beware of this company. Our designer was Sarah Kraus. Never saw her after the demo. The first GM for the job Brian Pop, he walked out right after everything was demo'd. The second GM Pete Coffman was just as bad. Actually caught them trying to cover up water damaged wood caused by them using cheap materials. They hung up towel racks with just screws, not anchors. Towel rack fell down during first use! Seriously BEWARE! We have water damage and a bathroom still torn up after more than a year."
5,"I recently finished 2 bathrooms with S&W in Palm Harbor, Florida.  Kirsten Phillips was our designer and Mike Frary was the project manager/GC.  They were fantastic.  S&W has an app that allows you to know exactly what is scheduled each day, what is planned and easily connect with the team.  All of the subcontractors were pleasant, respectful and helpful. I am sure it wasn’t easy, one bathroom is on 2nd story, one on 3rd story. I had a vision of what I wanted, shared that and pictures with Kirsten and she helped me through all of the processes.  I picked out things that I knew I wanted and she helped guide me in areas I was unsure.  We built the house 20 years ago and kept putting off doing the bathrooms.  Now I am so happy, I should have done it sooner.  I highly recommend S&W, they were fantastic to work with.  And huge thanks to Shirley A who helped set me up with Kirsten to keep personal friendship and business separate."
4,"S&W Kitchens did a great job with our kitchen renovation. We have a small kitchen that was not in the best shape and we were really looking for design solutions to create more useable space without changing the footprint of the kitchen. Sarah was our designer and really listened to what we wanted and did a excellent job designing our new kitchen. She also provided us with many options within our budget so we could get something that fit our aesthetic without breaking the bank. The only issue with the whole process was with our backsplash tile, but Sarah and our site supervisor Adam, listened to our concerns and worked to address the problem so that we were happy with the results."
5,"My wife and I were very pleased with the professional experience we had with S & W Kitchens Palm Harbor.  The designer, Shirley Aguilu, provided excellent ideas, listening to our ideas, and producing a kitchen renovation plan that encompassed all of our requests.  The team, including Shirley, Steve, Tony and Amber, were on top of all aspects of the complete kitchen renovation.  This included frequent contact to ensure the job was being completed, and ensuring all segments (installing floor tile, cabinets, laundry room, countertops, backsplash, plumbing and electrical work) were correctly completed.  We highly recommend S & W Kitchens Palm Harbor, for their work."
5,"All we can say is WOW!  S&W Kitchen did a fantastic job renovating our kitchen. The difference between our old kitchen and new is like night and day. Our kitchen was old, falling apart, cabinet doors not closing, bowing shelves and poor lighting.  Lindsey Schwartz, our Project designer, was great to work with. She guided us through choosing cabinets, flooring, backsplashes and every detail of our kitchen make-over.  She pointed out less expensive choices although we did not always listen, and different options. The demolition and installations teams were all very professional and courteous. They always let us know what they were going to be doing and when.  We highly recommend S&W Kitchens."
5,"S&W Kitchens does fantastic work—from the design all the way to the punch list. They were perfectionists with our home. Our designer, Laura, listened carefully to our needs and came up with a beautiful design. She gave us just enough choices that we felt like it was our personal design without being overwhelmed by selections. We remodeled our kitchen, master bath and guest bath, and we couldn’t be more pleased with the results. We feel like we have a custom home. We fell in love with our construction crew—Kevin, Steven, Scott and Brian along with top notch subcontractors. They were meticulous about their work and took care of every tiny detail. They were professional and friendly too. We felt very comfortable having them in our home—whether we were at home or away. We have recommended S&W to family and friends."
5,"Our Kitchen & Fireplace were very out dated!  We had heard good things about S & W Kitchens so we went to check them out.  Our first impression was great.  We met with Designer, Amy Downs and was very impressed with her knowledge & experience.  She has amazing design ideas!  Signed our contract & we were ready to start.  We then met with the contractor, Davin Johnson.  He was also very experienced & professional.  Renovations can be a bit stressful, but we new we were in good hands!  Davin always updated us as to what was happening and when.  We got finished before our due date!  We can't thank S & W Kitchens enough for our beautiful transformation!  Oh yes, and we got our house professionally cleaned too, the team was amazing!!  My house was spotless.  We would definitely use them again."
5,"Victoria Pratt was an outstanding partner and provided a level of customer service that I truly appreciate.  She was friendly, informative, and helpful while we made our choice of wood countertop.  I first went online to find an outstanding butcher block or wood countertop product, called the manufacturer of the product and was informed S&W Kitchen was their distributor of that product in the Tampa Bay area, near our home.  Once I went in and started engaging with Victoria she struck me as highly professional, informative and knowledgeable about the product and how it would look in our kitchen remodel.  Victoria took the time to come out, see the kitchen remodel and helped me select a product.  She was also there upon delivery of a 200+ lb wood countertop and helped me quickly find an expert installer for such a beautiful product.  I enjoyed working with Victoria and would recommend her services and S&W Kitchen to anyone who asked."
5,"My kitchen remodel is so beautiful!  The project manager Brian,  communicated effectively so were kept informed of timelines and next steps. Our designer, Marilyn listed to what we wanted and helped us create our dream kitchen! All of the contractors were very professional and treated my home respectively. They even greeted my nosy puppy who had to come say hello to everyone who came to the house. Highly recommend!"
5,"S and W did our kitchen makeover after 44 years of living in this house.
I found them to be very professional, clean and respectful of our property.
I would suggest them to anyone considering a renovation"
5,"From the start of the bathroom remodel to the end, Whitney at S & W Kitchens took a dream of what we wanted our bathroom to be and made it a reality. Our bathroom was original from 1988 and needed to be completely upgraded! At the start we scheduled a visit with Whitney and laid out the parts we needed and wanted to incorporate into our bathroom. Whitney then helped us to pick out a color scheme and quartz countertop, tiles, floor, lights and accessories. After about a week, Whitney drew up a CAD design to show us how the bathroom would look like and showed us. We immediately loved it and signed the paperwork to get it started. Because of the pandemic and wood shortages, it took about a month to get all the supplies together for the bathroom (Still good if you ask me) and then they delivered them to our garage for safekeeping. Mike, our foreman, met with us to lay out the work schedule for the remodel and set a demo date. Mike was attentive to our work schedule and our concerns of making sure our cat did not get out. Therefore, Mike made sure to let us know when people would be coming so we could put our cat in a room. All of the people who came to work on the bathroom respected our privacy of not going in the doors that was marked that our pet could be in. Over the 6 months of the remodel (This was finished on time), Mike and Whitney were available for any and all questions, concerns and gave updates on everything. Our bathroom exceeded our expectations on how it was going to be. The new shower is roomier and awesome, more cabinet space and the countertops and sinks are spectacular! We both are very impressed with Whitney and Mike at S & W kitchens and without hesitation will use them again in the future!"
5,Excellent work and professionalism! Would hire again. They worked with us to make sure we were satisfied with all our choices.
5,"Having our kitchen redone with S&W Kitchens has been a complete life changing experience.  We own a 100 year old bungalow that had an original kitchen with granite slapped on top of the teeny tiny dollhouse size cabinetry.  We knew when we bought our house we would redo the kitchen, but had no idea with whom.  We stumbled upon S&W online and read through the reviews.  Larissa designed us the kitchen of my dreams, within our budget, while thinking of every detail and how we could maximize storage and obtain the aesthetic and type of environment that were so important to me.  Our superintendent, Christian, was excellent through the entire process.  The amount of time and effort he put into the construction of our kitchen totally surpassed by expectations.  If you are considering a kitchen reno I highly recommend S&W for the job, and HIGHLY recommend specifically working with Larissa, you will not regret it."
5,"S&W completely remodeled our kitchen and two baths.  Did it all go super smooth?  Not really, but what did go consistently right was designer Lacie Rice.  She worked with my wife and me from the beginning to the end and helped to resolve issues that arose along the way.  We are more than satisfied with the results and cannot speak highly enough about Lacie."
5,"Total bath remodel; pricey and started months later than we'd hoped - partially due to COVID and personnel change, but once started, project manager Davin was on top of all, employees and subs were all professional and we are very pleased with final product."
5,"We enjoyed working with S&W Kitchens! We built a new house and used them for not only the kitchen, but all the bathrooms as well. Everything turned out beautiful. Mollie was great to work with, very helpful & informative! Even though things were delayed due to Covid, we were in the loop throughout the whole process. The installer's attention to detail is 2nd to none. We are beyond happy with the way everything turned out in our home!!"
5,S&W is a five star company.  Lacie and Steve were excellent to work with and kept us informed through every step of the process.  We plan to use S&W for third project to renovate our kitchen.  If you have a project go with S&W and ask for Lacie and Steve.
5,"FANTASTIC Experience! We have been working out of our home since March of 2020 so we decided now would finally be the time to upgrade the kitchen to one we had been dreaming of for many years. We did our homework, read reviews and visited the S&W Kitchens Showroom in Melbourne, Florida. We were greeted by Laura Scott who was friendly, knowledgeable, professional, and honest, which made it easy to quickly develop a trust relationship with her. Laura ultimately became our Designer and as she gathered our requirements, she listened to all of our wish lists and concerns, and she shared lessons learned to help guide our decision making. She offered excellent suggestions and ultimately created a design that far exceed our expectations and enhanced the layout and function of the original blueprint. She also provided quick and timely communication throughout the entire process. Laura delivered on every promise she made, and she routinely stopped by to check in on the progress and make sure our expectations were being met. 

We had a pre-construction meeting at our home where we met the various superintendents and project managers that would be overseeing the job. We were provided with documentation that included all of our diagrams and decisions, and a thorough timeline of when we could expect events to occur. They offered expert advice on what to expect and answered all of our questions. They even were considerate of our dogs and ensured us of their safety. Our Project Superintendent, Vinny Mallo, provided excellent communication on scheduled workdays and arrival times. He worked closely with the crews and provided thorough oversight. The crews (demo, plumbing, electrical, cabinet install, backsplash tile, countertops) were extremely professional and provided quality work in a timely manner. From the virtually invisible seams on the beautiful quartz countertops to the expertly laid intricate backsplash tile, we were so impressed with the quality of work. They were always on time and presented virtually no disruptions to us, even in our telework environment. We were also impressed with how clean they kept the environment, hauling away debris at the end of the work days, and keeping all of our areas orderly. 

Bottom line…we are EXTREMELY happy, highly recommend Laura Scott, and S&W Kitchens and would definitely use their services again."
5,"S&W Kitchens brought me out of the 70s! My remodel was better than I ever expected and the cost less than estimates I had received from other companies. The remodel included removing my walls and ceilings down to the studs. After our first meeting, my designer, Sarah Kraus, knew exactly what I wanted and needed. She went by my color schemes and chose the cabinets, tile, backsplash and lighting perfectly. I love the results!  
My supervisor, Brian Pope, responded to my calls and any questions I had immediately.  I felt he went over and above what was expected of him. Both projects were done on schedule and my home was kept as clean as possible while the work was in process. I now have an open floor plan and a beautiful, efficient kitchen and master bathroom. I would highly recommend S&W Kitchens and especially Sarah and Brian. Thank you for my beautiful finished project."
5,"We wanted to update our kitchen and laundry room. We wanted to replace our builder grade cabinets and granite counter tops with high quality cabinets (with better organization), quartz counter tops and slab backsplash. I spent a lot of time planning my dream kitchen and laundry room. Right down to the last detail. We also needed new sinks, faucets, and pendant lights. One of the biding companies expected us to source these items our selves. What a pain! That was one of the main reasons we chose S & W Kitchens and Bath. 

The other reason we pick S & W was after meeting our designer, Lacie Rice. She came to our home and took measurements and listened while I laid out my vision. She made the process so easy. I met with her several times in the showroom in Tampa to shop and design. She found everything I wanted. She even matched the outlet covers on the island with the cabinet color. 

We met with construction manager Steve Cota and Designer Lacie for a final walk through of the plans and discuss the process. Everything was explained thoroughly. The estimate and final contract were meticulously detailed. We could see where every dollar would be spent.

Every team (demo, plumbing, electrical, drywall, paint, cabinet install and counter fabricator) worked hard. They were respectful and tidy. Every step of the way Steve and Lacie were accessible. The back and forth communication was excellent. The permits all passed with no issues. They even sent cleaners before my house guests arrived for a holiday weekend.

The quality of the Omega cabinets are excellent. The color is perfect. The Cambria Quartz counters and backsplash are beautiful. The kitchen and laundry room are much more functional now, too. Everything looks exactly how I had pictured in my mind. We couldn’t be happier with the results. It looks amazing!!!"
5,"We are so pleased with the total kitchen renovation we recently completed with S&W Kitchens in South Tampa. We literally demolished our original kitchen, removing walls, going all the way down to the studs and built a brand new kitchen. Our designer, Larissa Hicks and her design assistant, Gina Cerimele were able to take our basic kitchen ideas and design the perfect kitchen for us. The design process was very collaborative and at the end they were even able to come up with some creative solutions to keep our project within our budget. The construction phase went very smoothly. When we came across a “load bearing beam” in an unexpected place, the team quickly adjusted the design plan with minimal cost incurred. Mike Frary was our construction supervisor and he did a great job keeping us informed and the job on schedule. I highly recommend S&W Kitchens and designer Larissa Hicks for anyone who is doing a kitchen renovation."
5,"S&W Kitchens did an amazing job on our kitchen and bath remodel! Greg Flassig was our designer, and he did an amazing job! Also Pete Coffman worked with us to get the construction done. He was great at explaining everything, as well as promptly answering any questions we had. Both were there for us the entire time. The crew did a great job. Thanks for a great job!"
4,"We had our master bath remodeled.  It took a little longer than expected for the project to be completed.  Part of the delay was due to the shortage of building materials, not S&W Kitchen's fault.  The Kitchen & Bath Project Designer, Sarah Kraus Bartelson, and Super Intendent, Brian Popp were helpful, efficient, and easy to work with. 

We love our master bath and this company has our recommendation!!!

Lonise"
5,"Our new kitchen is stunning! The whole experience was so well organized from planning, choosing materials, and construction completion. Our designer, Mayerlin, was very helpful and responsive. S&W stayed true to budget and on schedule. All of the contractors who came to work in our home were on time, dependable, professional, and very clean. I will definitely use S&W again. Highly recommend!"
5,"In one word, AWESOME!  I hired S&W Kitchens to remodel both of my bathrooms and my laundry room in a condo that I had just purchased.  I have done some other renovation projects in the past and I was concerned that they wait until all your materials are in stock before they start.  But now I totally get that concept!  There were delays with a few items and I wasn’t waiting around in a demolished house.  Demo started once everything arrived!  Savana, Dale, Kevin and the rest of the team did an amazing job.  They were kind and courteous to me.  And clean, neat and respectful of my home.  If a problem came up, they fixed it immediately.  They finished a week early and stayed on budget.  When I’m ready to do my kitchen, they will be my first phone call.  I would highly recommend S&W Kitchens for any remodeling project."
5,"It was amazing to see my design come to reality in this kitchen renovation. The S&W kitchens team was  so amazing.  My designer Sarah Kraus and my construction Superintendent Brian Popp were so professional and stayed on to of creating the specks /details ,and scheduling all the different contractors and inspections in a smooth manner. They really hire excellent subcontractors that really know their specialties very well. They all cleaned up their  area very well after each job,  protected the furniture and floors very well, and were careful not to damage their surroundings. They subcontracted Zolt Granite for the quartz and they too did an excellent job. The only 2 drawbacks I had was that I went into contract after Thanksgiving 2020 and the project did  not commence until the 6th of January 19, 2021. Luckily the project was completed in 4 weeks. The other concern is that they were a lot more expensive than we thought, but they really provide quality work, so that really counts."
5,"We engaged S&W Kitchens to assist with renovating our kitchen.  Our project was relatively small.  It involved replacing the existing granite countertop with an quartz countertop as well as making alterations to the configuration of our counter.  S&W also performed ancillary work such as replacing our kitchen sink and faucet.  They also replaced the countertop and sink in our laundry room and make some modifications to enable our dryer to fit properly.  Laura Scott was our designer and she remained involved throughout the project to ensure our satisfaction.  We were impressed by Laura's professionalism as well as by the quality of S&W's work.  We were provided detailed plans for our project which the various tradesmen followed to a tee.  Our project was completed efficiently, on time and with minimal disruption to our home.  S&W expended a lot of effort on detailed finishing to make sure that every aspect of the countertop, as well as the existing cabinetry, was perfect.  We would highly recommend S&W Kitchens for any home remodeling need."
2,"The full review is too long for houzz's submission field. Here is an abbreviated review.

We had several problems with S&W and I could not recommend them as a premium service.

They mis-measured our kitchen from the start and didn't catch that error until months into the project. We had to redesign the kitchen on the fly and they don't seem to take responsibility for the fact that we did not receive the kitchen we ordered.

They are clearly accepting more work than they can handle, and their workers are exhausted and distracted. This led to several errors. My full review has a page worth of bullet points as the errors were numerous and costly.

They damaged expensive materials, and left us to find the problems. There are finish issues that remain to be completed, and I have been waiting nearly a month for any answer to my ongoing issues.

This project also took month's longer than the original completion date.

Our foreman quit our project any further repairs pretty much finished once they got things nice enough for a pretty picture.

Some of their ""premium"" products are already having issues with coatings coming off, and blemishes from install that were never repaired.

They are a mediocre service charging a premium price."
5,"We selected to use S&W Kitchens in Longwood after reading all their reviews and completing a consultation meeting with our designer to complete the total remodel of our kitchen & 3 bathrooms in our home. Considering that we had started this big project in late February/early March 2020 prior to Covid-19, we are very happy with the final results and end product and design. The whole remodel did take longer than expected and there were a few delays & hiccups...but over all we love our new kitchen and bathrooms. Sarah, our personal Designer was an instrumental part in the entire process and a joy to work with. She was professional, open-minded in our vision, creative and understanding to what we wanted in our home regarding design & specific efficient functional needs for our family...also all while keeping our budget in mind without compromising quality and design. Robert our General Contractor was experienced & knowledgeable and also was pleasant to work with and was in communication with us and the entire team. Our entire S&W project team Sarah, Robert, David, Kevin & Craig were professional and great to work with. We are very satisfied with the work performed and look forward to enjoying our home with family & friends. Thank you to our S&W Kitchens Longwood Team for bringing our longtime vision for our kitchen/baths remodel into a beautiful reality. It was all well worth it!  ~Dan & Tiffany Marcos"
5,"S&W Kitchens, Melbourne proved to be a “first-class” company to address renovation of my master bath which was damaged following a lightning strike at my home.  Because the bathroom had been completely gutted (ceiling, drywall, cabinets), the challenge was to salvage as much of the original custom cabinetry, fixtures etc. using my own contractors (plumbers, electricians, cabinet installer etc.) and then replace my countertops and vanity sinks for an updated look and style.  From the moment I entered the S&W state-of-the art showroom, I was impressed with the array of choices and quality of products.  More importantly, I discovered that designer Laura Smith is worth her weight in gold!   Laura carefully listened to my needs and guided me every step of the way.  After her visit to my home, we selected the Kohler sinks and the perfect Pompeii quartz (Valley Sand) with copper veining to compliment my existing maple cabinets and Plantation Shutters.  As an added bonus, due to her prior background in working at a plumbing showroom, she also advised me of drain assembly parts needed for my existing faucets and provided other helpful-hints for the re-build.  She was able to schedule countertop installation within a short timeframe (far more quickly than other Melbourne fabricators).  Throughout this project Laura communicated frequently with me and was professional, pleasant and caring.  I am delighted with the results!"
5,"Back in January, we started the process to renovate our main living space focused around our kitchen, we delayed construction some as we wrapped our heads around working/schooling from home in March/April.  Starting in June, the construction made an already hectic summer that much more interesting, but in the end it was totally worth it...  working from home post-renovation these last couple of months has been that much more enjoyable!  Here's a few pics of before and the professional final shots.  Anyone looking for a recommendation, S & W Kitchens was so great to work with!!"
5,"This review is late in the making. Sarah Kraus did such a great job in designing my master bath and bedroom. This is the second time she has worked with me, which says something. If you have not worked with a designer you need to. What I love about Sarah she not only helps me get ideas, but she is hands on from beginning to end. With any remodel project things come up. Sarah handled every concern I had, amazing. I love my new space. Can’t believe it is the same room."
1,"We were excited to begin a remodel of our outdated kitchen, laundry room, dinning room, living room and office and decided to use S&W Kitchens, even though the price was considerably higher due to their promise of excellent service and customer satisfaction. That was not the case at all. There were problems right from the start with broken promises, incorrect measurements, a breech of our bank account information involving the police department due to our paperwork and personal check being dropped in the street, wrong materials ordered and delivered, poor workmanship, damaged and incorrect cabinets, incorrectly fabricated granite, damaged and destroyed new appliances, workmen not showing up when promised, the list goes on and on. It's been over a year since we first met with the designer, and over nice months since the gutting of the area first occurred, and we are just now getting the final replacement cabinet doors, of which one was still blemished. Our remodel has been the laughing stock of our neighborhood and we will be finishing parts of the job ourselves. This has ended up being, what we call, ""The most expensive do-it-yourself project ever."" Even with the overall design being very nice, we see constant reminders of how badly everything progressed."
5,"When planning to remodel our kitchen we never thought that our Dream Kitchen could come into fortition this AMAZING. Sarah Kraus literally saw our vision from the minute we started to talk.  She listened to our ideas, was attentive to  our needs and circumstances, thoughtful in not only the work she does but goes the extra mile to get to know the client , organized as well;  if you were to request a copy of anything she has it readily available.  This process really does set the customer up for true comfortability during the crazy process of redesigning a kitchen.  The time line presented was reasonable and finished well around the time given.  The team that worked with her, Brian_ Project Manger, David- carpenter and the other fields contracted in to assist with the job were always professional and considerate.  The kitchen design is beautiful, simply breath taking.  Every detail we discussed and designed were delivered. The craftmanship that was taken into our stair railings is UNBELIEVABLE.  They brought our Pinterest idea to life, with of course a some designing ideas from Sarah !  We have done many remodels with contractors and this by far was our best experience.  I highly recommend Sarah at S&WKitchens.  She is very talented and TOP NOTCH!"
5,"We used S&W Kitchens for our total kitchen and foyer renovation.  We literally changed everything from our floor to ceiling in each room.  S&W handled every aspect of our remodel.  They handled everything from demo, plumbing, electrical, flooring, ceiling removal and all of our kitchen cabinets are custom made perfectly for our kitchen.  Our granite is absolutely gorgeous and looks like the ocean it fits perfectly with our home decor, colors, etc.  Each employee who came into our home were very nice and respectful.  They cleaned their work space every time they worked at our home and also sent a cleaning service into our home to clean any dust that built up on our furniture during the demolition.  We have 2 dogs that loved the employees as well and it made the process even more enjoyable.  Our designer, Lacie, was absolutely in tune with that we wanted and was patient as we took our time to pick out each piece of backsplash, tile flooring, granite, lighting, etc. We are remodeling our dining room next and we are 100% sure we  are using S&W again for this renovation."
5,"My husband and I recently had our kitchen remodeled by S&W Kitchens.  We had new cabinets and countertops installed.  The entire team was  timely,  competent, and a pleasure to work with.  Our communication with the designer and site supervisor was excellent.  We were always aware of the status of the construction.  Being in the midst of covid,  the work teams had temperature checked and face masks on during their time in my home.  We highly recommend S&W Kitchens."
5,After many many searches for a vanity we went with S & W kitchens my designer Sarah Kraus walked me thru the process.  The vanity had to custom designed for the space needed.  They vanity is beautiful the staff at S & W are wonderful I would recommend them to all my friends ❤️
5,"After searching 3 years for a good company to help me remodel my master bathroom, I finally found the perfect company.  S&W Kitchens did an excellent job!  They have excellent designers, project managers, and a great team who completed the job on time (even during the summer of Covid 19), on budget, and the final result exceeded my expectations!  What else could you ask for?  I will definitely be using them again in the future and highly recommend the team out of Melbourne, Florida.  Special thanks to Lindsey and Dale for making this such a positive experience!"
5,"We've just completed a project with S&W Kitchens.  They're ""not just kitchens!""  We began with several planning conversations with Carol in their showroom and in our home.  She was helpful all the way, asking all the right questions, providing sketches as the plan came together.  It was no small task: removing the tub, removing wall tile, re-directing the plumbing and drain, installing new tile on the walls and floor, new shower fixtures, a corner seat, grab handle, and sliding glass shower doors.  The end result is beautiful with nothing being damaged along the way.  All of the materials are top quality, all of the craftsmen were skilled, pleasant and knowledgeable, working under the careful eyes of Carol and of our superintendent, Pete who scheduled everything masterfully, communicating each day resulting in minimum disruption of our household.  We were so impressed with their work we asked them to undertake another project, new vinyl-plank flooring in our home office."
5,"We are very satisfied with our kitchen remodel with S&W Kitchens.  Our Project Designer, Mayerlin, was very helpful in getting us the right design for our needs & preferences.  Our Project Manager, Brian, was very thorough, straight forward, and always kept us up to date throughout the process regarding scheduling of electricians, plumbers, inspections, ordering etc.  We were never in the dark as to what was going on, which made us feel at ease throughout the entire process.  We highly recommend S&W Kitchens as they were great for us.  

Chris & Jo"
5,"My wife and I are extremely satisfied with services provided by S and W Kitchens during the complete remodel of our master bath. From design to completion, Sarah was accessible and attentive during the entire process. Was available for unscheduled site visits to verify design changes and the always unexpected issues by providing on site communication with the installers and stayed touch through the process. Most importantly the result came out the way we wanted. In many remodels the work can end up being what the contractor wants. Sarah listened to what we envisioned. A special thanks to Robert Ungavarsky, the superintendent for the project, for  handling and providing recommendations for issues as they came up and for the addons we unexpectedly came up with.
We would highly recommend Sarah and her team at S and W."
5,"My husband and I recently undertook a major renovation of our kitchen, master bathroom, and guest bathroom.  We were extremely fortunate that we selected S&W Kitchens as our partner in this renovation.

Christina, our designer, was brilliant in understanding our goals and worked closely with us on color schemes, tile patterns, kitchen appliances, kitchen island space, bathroom hardware, and more!  From day one of demolition (thank you, Tony!) to the final day about nine weeks later, Mike, Christina, and everyone that worked to make our dreams come alive were exceptionally competent, responsive, professional, and friendly.  At the conclusion of our project, our kitchen and bathrooms were dramatically more beautiful (and highly functional) than we had imagined possible in our dreams.  

When you partner with S&W Kitchens, you collaborate with true experts.  I simply cannot adequately describe how well everyone, but particularly Christina and Mike, worked with us on all details, adjusting work schedules and “projects within projects” to come to completion smoothly, without glitches.

We also enjoyed this renovation project – all of the people involved were amazing to work with!  Anyone with a dream in mind would do well to contact S&W Kitchens to see that dream be realized.

5,"Moving from Texas to Florida was quite a challenge.  We wanted to be closer to our children and find a home to accommodate our 2 horses and 4 dogs.  The home we found was ”A 
diamond in the rough”!  The only thing it had going for it was the lovely trees in the front yard, enough acreage for the horses and a move in ready barn.  
The day I walked into S and W kitchens and met Laura Scott was my best day since moving to Florida.  My kitchen (and the rest of the house) was not functional and so, so outdated. I explained my dilemma to Laura, and thanks to her positive attitude, she said she was up for the challenge.  And what a challenge it was.  Not only was the existing kitchen design a challenge, I had already bought the new appliances for the new kitchen.  The transformation from old, dark and outdated kitchen to a new, bright, updated and perfectly designed kitchen is amazing.  Laura is an outstanding person a designer.  She is the best along with the rest of the S and W Kitchens crew.  
Our kitchen is perfect!  George and Jo Rosenhauer"
5,"My wife and I are extremely satisfied with the entire scope of services provided by S and W Kitchens during the complete remodel of our kitchen. From the initial design to the final cabinet trim, Sarah remained accessible and attentive during the entire process. This included, but was not limited to effectively dovetailing our vision with her design expertise, site visits for design consultation and measurements, and subsequent verifications prior to ordering, on site communication with the installer and staying in touch through the entire process. From working with us to find the perfect slabs for the counter tops to helping us select our appliances we highly recommend Sarah Kraus and her team at S and W."
5,"We had a total kitchen remodel done by S&W. Rosemarie Szedula was our designer, she did a fantastic job from start to finish. She was ever present and kept everything on time and on track. Her design and features were wonderful, she had many great ideas that we love."
5,"We recently had a bathroom, kitchen and bar area renovated by S&W Kitchens. We entered a project of this scale with some trepidation, but overall the whole process went smoothly and we could not be happier with the outcome.  Designer Lindsey Schwartz and superintendent Dale Thomas were diligent in the planning of the project such that each aspect was scoped out in detail before they started.
Lindsey was always a pleasure to work with, knowledgeable about overall design elements as well as available products, and always responsive to messages. She was able to guide us through making style choices without imposing her personal preferences. Dale was always on top of the project, available to meet to discuss details, and had the knowledge and foresight to avoid problems that might occur. 
All of the personnel, including the construction workers were diligent and courteous. 
All in all, we are incredibly pleased with our renovations both aesthetically and from the quality that went into them. We would work with S&W again in a heartbeat."
5,S &W are wounderful people to work with. They are extremely professional we did had some minor problems but they took care of any problem that popped up.  They did suggest an appliance person that i used and they are helping me where the appliance company wont. Not there fault. The appliance company has some deal with a warranty company called dish do not use the dish warranty. But again Dale and Mike are awesome to work with.
5,"Roisin Wong, our project manager at S&W Kitchens, was simply fantastic! She guided me through the entire process of renovating our kitchen from start to finish: layout, cabinet selection, lighting, countertop and backsplash and installation. She is professional, patient, friendly, talented and incredibly helpful! She knew our budget and gave several options to help me stay within that budget. She asked questions and made suggestions based on the way we use our kitchen. As it is the most important room in our home, she helped me put together a space that is light, bright and welcoming. Most important, she designed a space that completely fits the design of our home! I wholeheartedly recommend Roisin Wong."
5,"I had an excellent, gold-star experience with S&W Kitchens. My designer, Fred, was outstanding and went above and beyond to strategize ideas for accomplishing my bathroom remodeling goals. His creative solutions to my needs were wonderful! S&W is a first class company that employs first class, top notch employees. Everyone on the team was professional, cordial, friendly, knowledgeable, and fun to work with. I enjoyed working with them on a first name basis  and getting to know them a bit. I found them earnest and hardworking. They treated me not only as a client, but a real human! I would recommend anyone interested in S&W's services to contact them!"
5,"After sourcing many companies and meeting with designers, I made the final decision to hire S&W for a complete remodel of our very outdated 23 yr old kitchen. There wasn’t a designer I met, that I was more comfortable with then Roisin Wong. We met with over 10 local companies and two from out of the area, I was drawn back to S&W based solely on my interaction with Roisin, her compassion, patience, & level of expertise proved to be the right choice.  Throughout the entire project I had my share of panic attacks and once again, Roisin eased my fears, concerns and Michael addressed any issue or complaints I had. Overall, the kitchen is amazing, the layout gave us additional space, something I thought would be impossible. Everyone who comes into our home, gives us endless compliments as to how beautiful our kitchen is. I cant thank S&W enough for the professionalism and outstanding quality of work. I would definitely recommend their services, coming from someone who’s had their share of horrible contractors."
5,"We really disliked our kitchen at one time, and decided to do something about that by hiring Sarah of S&W who came highly recommended.  The transformation to our new kitchen is amazing! Not only does it look beautiful, but it is very functional and we now have more storage with a very important new coffee station. Sarah gave us a kitchen with a purpose and so aesthetically pleasing! We have received many compliments. We love it and enjoy every second!!! Sarah truly brought our vision to light! Thank you Sarah!!"
5,"We have done 2 renovations with S&W (master suite and kitchen plus flooring throughout house) and have been thrilled. Laura is a gifted designer who just ""knew"" what I would love - she was right AND professional down to the last detail.  Dale and crew are experts and dedicated craftsmen.  I enjoy working with them all and would NEVER consider using anyone else."
5,"My wife and I heard about S&W kitchens from our friends at Real Radio 104.1.  After doing a little homework of our own, it was a rather easy decision to go with them for our kitchen renovation.  We weren't planning on remodeling our kitchen however due to a leak in our old dishwasher we were forced into the situation.  At first, we were somewhat concerned with the timeframe, budget, and the quality of product we would be able to afford.  My wife had a vision in her mind of what she wanted the kitchen to look like.  Fortunately, we ended up working with an amazing designer at S&W Kitchens, Sarah Kraus.  Not only was Sarah able to offer us several high-quality options within our budget, but she also worked diligently with us to provide an itemized list of the products and services that were in scope for the renovation which was required by our insurance provider.  We met with Sarah personally in the S&W showroom as well as in our home on several occasions and she worked around our busy schedule to accommodate us.  Once the design was completed and construction was underway, Sarah made sure to keep us informed on what work would be done and by whom.  As with any major construction project, there are always a few hiccups along the way.  What impressed me the most about Sarah and S&W Kitchens was the confident reassurance that they would take on any unforeseen issues in stride and ensure the job was done not only to meet our requirements but also to meet their standard of excellence.  Sarah was easy to communicate with by phone, e-mail and in person to discuss any concerns.  With little to no delay she provided us with a remediation plan each time as well as a follow-up to ensure any and all issues were taken care of.  In the end, my wife and I are extremely happy to say that our kitchen is now picture perfect, and with the customized personal design, our house feels even more like our home. A big thanks to Sarah and the rest of the S&W team that made it all happen."
5,"Our master bath remodel was our second project with S&W. Once again we are delighted with the results. Not only is our new master bathroom gorgeous, it is efficient and functional. No more clutter on the counter or in the shower. Everything is hidden away while still being conveniently within reach. The construction team addressed every detail, resulting in the flawless execution of the design. They were courteous, professional and respectful at all times. 

We worked with designer Laura Scott as we had on our kitchen project. Her approach is collaborative and we knew she would help us bring our vision to life. She listened to our needs and desires and then offered fresh ideas that complemented ours. We appreciate how she touched base with us frequently from design to completion. 

Bottom line, we recommend S&W and would definitely use them again."
5,"I recently finished a renovation of my kitchen and laundry room with S&W kitchens. I had used them before for my master bathroom.
I highly recommend them. It was a very professional job.
Of course the process wasn’t completely smooth but at every turn they came up with a good solutions to any problems encountered .
Krista Agapito my designer and Pete Coffman my construction manager were excellent. Krista’s design made my kitchen and laundry room much more functional and beautiful too. Pete was great with keeping me informed everyday with what was to happen; which I greatly appreciated. Pete was also excellent with solving problems along the way.
I what definitely recommend the whole team at S&W Kitchens ."
5,"We have used S&W for both our kitchen and master bath. We are very pleased with both projects. The workmanship and professionalism of all the trades was top notch. 
We feel the leadership and involvement of Robert Ungvarsky, the contractor and Mary Burkhammer, the designer, insured a positive experience. 
Robert’s daily involvement and communication kept us current throughout the process. That was greatly appreciated."
5,"We hired S &W for our master bath remodel after online research. Kristin (designer)  performed a thorough in house courtesy consultation with very accurate measuring. We met at their Windermere location for  a 3D, no pressure presentation and obtained an estimate. Once we committed to the project  we got introduced to Robert Ungvarswky our project manager.  From that moment on he was in charge on scheduling and keeping us informed of  day to day progress mostly via txt message with real time pictures . We encountered some unexpected work order changes but remained confident on their ability and disposition of finishing our project and meet our high expectations   We are happy with our final product and reassured that we can always contact them for any questions since they use reputable local companies And high quality materials,  Robert showed great professionalism and was available to address all our questions which made the process less stressful. I would recommend S&W to friends in the future"
5,"Review for S&W Kitchens WINDERMERE location.
Necessary bathroom renovation (LAKE NONA) to make shower larger with wide door and ability to roll-in wheelchair when necessary.  Removed tub to expand shower area and elongate sink wall which gave much more storage space.  Wasn't planning this project, but became a necessary project for medical reasons, and couldn't have gone more smoothly.  If you are really price shopping, this probably isn't the group for you.  But if you have enough going on in your life already and want to know that the team is going to do the project properly and not cut corners, and be there when they say they will be there, then Robert and James are the team for you.  You will pay more, but I have seen some questionable construction around here but not with these guys.  Everyone was on point, the design, the construction, tilers, electricians, plumbers, paint/drywall.  If any construction project could ever be considered great, this was it.  It was a pleasure to welcome every member of this construction team into our home and if it ever becomes necessary again, I won't even consider anyone else."
5,"I highly recommend this Contractor.  I hired them on word of mouth, and they've done 2 bathrooms in a home which I just sold, and we are on our third now, in my home!
I am working with Shirley and Eric, and their professionalism is impressive.  Construction is, by nature, chaotic, messy, and noisy.  They minimized all these factors, and I am able to let go, and let them handle it every time. When it is time to do another, they will do it!"
5,"S&W Kitchens (Melbourne, FL office in particular) is a great company to work with, and Laura Scott is a wonderful designer. 

I hired them to remodel our 35 year old kitchen and had no clue where to begin. Laura walked us through the planning process with great patience and ease (and cheerful demeanor) beginning with an assessment of what we currently had and what we were hoping to accomplish in the finished design. With that understanding of our needs she worked up several proposed configurations and presented them to us as 3D and 2D presentations. Then she guided us through the material selection process for color, style, and mechanical configuration. Once we were satisfied with all that, she worked up a final plan including a detailed List of Materials and work plan. 

During that process we also met with Dale (construction lead). Together they laid out a timeline for the construction giving us a time window of best case and worst case duration. For the most part, they hit the timeline as promised and finished within the original prediction window.

The work crews were polite and friendly. We felt very comfortable having them around the house (no security concerns.) They answered any questions we had while they worked and during the job progress. They worked carefully and kept the house as clean as possible by removing construction debris each day and hauling it away (no dumpster in the driveway!). Floors were protected with heavy-duty cardboard mats that were taped in place to prevent damage. Our hardwood floors came through the process without damage. We used plastic drop-cloths over everything each day to shield from dust. (It's inevitable that dust gets everywhere. Buy a stock of A/C filters and plan on changing them out every day or at least every other day during demolition and early phases of the construction, especially if drywall work is going on.) They can also place plastic sheeting to close off rooms as much as possible but the circulating air carries a lot of dust around the house nonetheless.

Measurements were taken of our kitchen on at least two occasions ('measure twice, cut once' theory) so as to be sure they were correct. However, we still ended up ordering a special cabinet in one position as the one cabinet was too wide for the location because they ordered the wrong size. 

The quartz countertop fits perfectly. Alignment and seam work are exceptional. I couldn't find the seam until my wife pointed it out to me. The quality of the back-splash tile work is also exceptional. The installer meticulously hand fit pieces around the difficult areas. After the cabinets were installed, Laura inspected them and ordered replacement bits for anything that was scratched or dinged or had questionable surface finish. They cabinet installers adjusted all the drawer slides and cabinet hinges for proper operation.

They had first indicated that they would stage all the materials in their warehouse and then bring them over, then we discussed storing them in the garage, but we were concerned about humidity issues and bugs, but in the end the materials were all staged in our family room. (We moved everything into the other rooms to make room for the materials. It had two benefits: first, it was adjacent to the kitchen so it made work efficient and easy; secondly, all materials were under A/C and so all dimensions stabilized in the wooden parts prior to installation. It was inconvenient for us because of the crowding but it was probably the best solution in the end.)

It is inevitable that remodeling is inconvenient. However, S&W Kitchens did their best to make everything flow smoothly. We are very pleased with the finished result and I easily recommend S&W Kitchens and Laura Scott for anyone seeking to remodel their kitchen."
5,"The team at S & W of James, Robert, and Aniko did an outstanding job of design and build with our kitchen remodel/renovation.  They managed the entire project from start to finish.  They kept us in the loop throughout and the project was on track from the beginning.  The final results are incredible, beyond expectations, and we are very happy.  We would recommend S & W and this team if you're considering any type of kitchen or home remodel.  We will surely use them again for our next project!  Thanks again!"
5,"Thank goodness for S&W Kitchens! My husband and I had had bad experiences with renovations and contractors in the past and were beginning to think that there was no such thing as a good contractor. Luckily, we found S&W Kitchens. Whitney Rutledge immediately understood our style and knew what we were after from a design standpoint. She planned out our kitchen renovation for maximum utility and suggested features that brought our kitchen renovation to a whole new level. We are thrilled with what she and her team accomplished and we couldn't be happier!  We definitely recommend Whitney and S&W Kitchens for any project. You won't be disappointed!"
5,"We bought a fixer upper condo on the beach. We had heard so many horror stories of remodels gone bad. We hired S&W because of their great reputation for customer service. We were not disappointed. Lindsey Schwartz was our designer.  We did a complete remodel of master bath and kitchen and minor remodel on the two guest baths. She clearly knows what she is doing and was a pleasure to work with. We were impressed with the quality of work and how easy it was to work with S&W. All workers are given  background checks.  This was important to us because our condo was not going to be livable during construction. Dale, the construction superintendent, was great. He impressed our condo Board of Directors.   We needed their approval to proceed, so this was important. We did not get nickeled and dimed  to death. The price in the contract is what we paid. Every Friday, I received an email from Lindsey with photos on progress for the week and plans for the next week. 

 Everyone who has seen our remodel is totally impressed. They are a high end remodeler and you will be happy you hired them."
5,"Whitney worked with us for several months to find exactly the look we wanted for flooring, backsplash, paint, countertops. IT turned out better than we could have imagined! Mike managed the construction and was very responsive to our requests and change orders. Thanks Mike and Whitney!!"
4,"S&W Kitchens delivered on my kitchen remake. It was a long and tedious process, but construction manager, Pete, was on top of it all. When things didn't work out, he moved in and got it right. Especially the wonderful company, The Groutsmith, who worked wonders in my   kitchen backsplash tile.  Thank you Pete, and S&W!!"
5,It was a great experience working with Lacie Rice from S&W Kitchen in South Tampa.   They took great care of us and the end result is a stunning a high quality Poggenpohl kitchen.  Recommend S&W to anyone.
5,"We worked with S & W to remodel our master bath.  Working with Carol our designer was a pleasure.  She made us feel comfortable and valued.  Our project manager, Pete was easy to work with and kept us updated on the project and let us know when to expect workers on a daily basis.  Carol and Pete and the whole S & W team were always respectful of us and our home.  We could't be happier with the finished  project.  Would highly recommend working with this company!"
5,"I chose S&W Cabinets to redo my kitchen. Shirley and team from GC (Mike) to all the individuals that performed the many tasks were great and highly professional. They kept me informed and as the project progressed. Mike even made sure that I had a functional kitchen as soon as they could, since this project occurred during the holidays.
I love my new kitchen so much I’m having them redo my master bath. Looking forward to this project."
5,S & W did a great job and we are 100% pleased with our beautiful outdoor kitchen! Working with Yina was a pleasure and we highly recommend her - she was always available and totally responsive to all of our needs.
5,"I totally LOVE the way my kitchen came out.  With the assistance of Laura at S&W, it is my dream kitchen that I waited 21 years for.  I love to cook and this kitchen makes me want to do more.  I will post pics at a different time.  I had my colors in mind, but the selection and staff were great.  Will definitely use them again, most likely in bath room."
5,"I had been planning and visioning my outdoor living area for a couple of years before finally pulling the trigger. I had numerous companies come out to provide designs and quotes to best accomplish my ideas. I chose Sarah with S & W Kitchens to move forward with my project because I was impressed with her background and willingness to research ideas that she had not done before. The work went as scheduled, the job was clean and everyone friendly. When the project was complete, it was exactly what I had envisioned and I could not have been happier. I have been described as very particular and have frustrated contractors on previous projects with my expectations. The team at S & W did not bat an eye and made sure that everything was completed exactly to my request. I would highly recommend Sarah and S & W Kitchens for anyone that is in the market for an upgrade or an addition to their living area."
5,Mayerlin at S&W Kitchens was our designer for our kitchen remodel  She was very professional and very easy to work with.  She took the time to make sure our needs were met within our budget.  Everything was done on time and our kitchen turned out beautiful!  I highly recommend Mayerlin and S&W Kitchens.
5,"S&W Kitchens redid our kitchen and replaced all our tile flooring in the house.  Designer Jaime was patience itself as he helped us select product, guiding us to the price, quality, and styles that we were interested in.  He accommodated our schedule for meetings at home and at the show room.  Project supervisor Austin kept us informed through every step of the process.  He communicated with us every single day, most days in person as he stopped by to check on the work.  If not in person, then on the phone.  If I needed to call him, he always answered my call.  All the workers did great work, were polite and efficient.  I would most definitely use S&W Kitchens again."
5,"The S&W team lead by Krista was phenomenal to work with during our entire process. She, Mollie, and Haleh from the Winter Park location were intuitive, creative, and had follow through after every meeting. They gave clear direction and recommendations. Dale, their specialist that did the install was professional, polite, and very talented in making any needed adjustments to  our cabinets. There's nothing better than working with experienced people that actually listen when we're investing in high quality cabinets with smart designs. I would 100% recommend them for any design needs."
5,"We had managed several home renovation projects in our previous home and we were reluctant to start another one in our current home knowing the time commitment and the disruptions to your life.  As a result, we thought we would start with a small project of replacing our kitchen cabinet doors.  Our research brought us to S&W Kitchens.  After our initial meeting and learning they were a full service company, we decided to switch projects and move forward with the renovation of one of our guest bathrooms.  Once we connected with Lacie Rice in the South Tampa office, we loved the entire process!  She was amazing to work with and had great design ideas.  The S&W process was fantastic – Lacie and Mike (construction foreman) facilitated everything for us from design, demo, renovations, and inspections.  Lacie reviewed every finish/detail, budget and calendar with us up front.  The timeline was accurate and the project was completed on time and within budget.  Lacie and Mike were awesome to work with during the project – they were very communicative and were great with our dog.  We did not worry about a thing – it was the smoothest renovation project we have ever had!  The finished product is beautiful – we love the new bathroom and our family does too!  We highly recommend using S&W for anyone that is contemplating any house renovations.  We will be using S&W on our next project.  Thank you Lacie, Mike and S&W Kitchens!"
5,"We started out with the intention of hiring a contractor to perform a  modest kitchen renovation (replacing cabinet doors and countertops), but even that proved to be daunting as we needed to manage and schedule each trade separately.  Then we found S&W Kitchens.  S&W acts as the general contractor and handles everything from design to renovation and appliance installation. 
Our modest kitchen renovation mushroomed into a whole house makeover – we replaced everything in the kitchen (including the appliances which we ordered through S&W), added new wood flooring throughout the house, renovated a bathroom, added crown molding, built out a new pantry, and more.  
Lacie in the south Tampa office was fantastic throughout the design and construction process.  She spent countless hours with us not only in her shop and in our home, but also accompanied us to our numerous visits to varied locations to select our countertops, plumbing fixtures, electrical fixtures, etc. Eric was the construction foreman on our project and was likewise great to work with.  We couldn’t be happier with the finished product and would definitely recommend S&W to anyone contemplating a home renovation project, large or small."
4,"Everyone I came in contact with was professional, patient and knowledgeable, including the subcontractors. Workmanship was good and communication was timely and clear.
I would recommend this company as long as u don't mind paying a little more."
5,"When we decided to do a complete teardown and redo of our kitchen, we knew we needed a full-service company that would manage the process, start to finish. We definitely got that with S&W Kitchens.  They took care of every detail and gave us a new kitchen that exceeded our dreams and expectations. 

We knew we needed a designer that we would feel comfortable working with. Our designer, Laura Scott, listened to us and completely understood our vision. She used her design know-how and considerable talent to pull together a kitchen that is not only beautiful, but incredibly efficient as well. There is nothing better than function meeting form and she definitely achieved that for us.  She was attentive to our project throughout the process, checking to make sure all was going well.  She went with me to the slab yard and patiently viewed all the countertop options to narrow down the selection.  I really appreciated her helpful suggestions and support during the selection process.  Picking out the color palette and the various materials for the kitchen was a breeze with her guidance.  Looking at the result, we would not change a thing. 

We were impressed with the S&W planning process where no detail was overlooked. A great deal of attention was given to planning, which we believe is a large part of the success of the project. S&W provided us with full documentation, including all of our decisions, plans and diagrams for the crew, and the sequence of events that would take place over the course of the project. The project stayed on track with only minor delays, resulting in a fully functioning kitchen by the promised end date.

Our project manager, Dale Thomas, is highly skilled at managing a project.  Not only did he keep the project moving, he used exemplary problem solving skills to resolve issues that came up along the way.  He elicited excellence from his crew, trade contractors and vendors.  Observing him in action, we came to trust that we were in good hands with Dale and crew.
Friends had warned us that a kitchen redo of this magnitude would be a horrible experience.  But S&W made it as painless as possible. Before tearing down the kitchen, they moved our refrigerator to the dining room so that we could set up a temporary kitchen to use during construction. They were thoughtful of our comfort throughout the process, keeping disruption to a minimum. The crew was friendly and considerate. They cleaned up at each step of the process and hauled away multiple trailers full of debris. They hooked up our washer and dryer early on to allow us to do laundry at home as soon as possible.  Long story short, the experience was far less disruptive than we expected.  

In a word, S&W stands for excellence.  We are glad we went with them and would definitely use S&W again in the future."
5,"I have worked together with Matt Carpenter on multiple occasions now and would highly recommend him to anyone in need of a professional cabinet designer.  His projects always run smoothly from start to finish and his ability to incorporate amazing design features is second to none.  Keep up the great work Matt, I look forward to the next one!"
5,"Just completed a major renovation (kitchen, bath, laundry room and fireplace) with S&W Kitchens. I choose S&W because of a recommendation from a friend and neighbor and to avoid all the “night-mare” kitchen remodeling stories I have heard over the years.  S&W came through for us and it was a stress-free remodeling project. Our S&W designer, Mary Burkhammer took the time to understand our design goals and vision and added the detail to turn our dream into a real plan and design. My husband is a detail-oriented engineer and he was greatly impressed by the S&W design and build process. Our construction foreman, Robert Ungvarsky turned the design into a reality.  They send master craftsmen across all the trades to complete your project. Believe me, you will not find this level of craftsmen in the yellow pages. I’m so satisfied with their work, I will be calling S&W to remodel my master bath."
5,"I am an interior designer in Orlando, and I have worked with Matt Carpenter on several of my projects.  The experience has been nothing but positive.  Matt is easy to work with and creative as well.  We have worked on large custom jobs as well as more simplistic projects.  The result has always been the same, total customer satisfaction and ease of execution.  I would certainly recommend them for your cabinetry job. 

Susan Ettinger"
4,Lacie and Eric were great to work with.  Lacie was told that I was not a shopper and to select 3 options from which to choose.  Everything she put forth was spot on and in keeping with what I was looking for.  Eric came and saved the day after a bit of a glitch with the original onsite leader.  Eric was able to make sure the project was on track and worked very closely with Lacie to ensure a quality deliverable.  I really enjoyed working with both Eric and Lacie. They are both very professional and care about doing what is right for their client.
5,"I have worked with Matt Carpenter many, many times over the years as an industry professional. He has designed everything from full custom kitchens to display vignettes for my customers.   He is an expert in his craft, acting as both a very talented designer (one of the few who will still hand sketch out a rough design to give a customer a visual) and as a true consultant to his customers, taking in to account their budget and lifestyle and thinking through all of the little details that will give them their perfect end result.  He's a true professional, and a pleasure to work with!"
5,If you are looking for a company to do a complete kitchen renovation look no further.  These folks have amazing ideas and are easy to work with.  Bill and Tim were both friendly and knowledgeable.  I am very please with the outcome of my kitchen remodel.
5,"I have had three remodeling jobs done by Bill and Tom of S & W Kitchens in Longwood, Florida. One bathroom and my kitchen were totally removed and rebuilt.  The other bathroom was basically refreshed with old wallpaper removed new flooring, bathroom hardware, vanity, mirror and fresh paint. Bill provided the decorating expertise while Tim supplied the project planning, supervision and selection of fantastic craftsman. My kitchen had some layout issues that compromised its utility.  These utility issues were completely resolved and I was left with a much more useable space.  All three spaces always receive compliments from my guests. I recommend the pair to anyone considering remodeling."
5,"S & W kitchens did a great job for us.  Replaced all our cabinets and we love them.  We found working with them a joy, all the workers were very professional and friendly.  I would recommend them anytime.  Working with Lindsey, my designer was great!"
5,"Having endured several competitors, we would go as far as saying Matt and his team at S+W are one of the most proficient and professional Cabinetry businesses we have come across. With x5 Bathrooms and a Laundry room to fit in our new build, the choices, design options and eventual outcome was exactly as we wished for.
Thank you Matt.
George + Rita Brewster"
5,"I bought a house on bayshore 2 years ago and decided to totally remodel the whole kitchen.  After interviewing a few designers, we settled on S&W.  This is a totally honest review and anyone is welcome to come see our amazing kitchen. The design of the kitchen was amazing.  Wolf and Subzero appliances, great layout, beautiful counters, cabinets and flooring.  It's been a year and we are still amazed at how well it came out. Larissa was our designer in the Tampa office and she is totally gifted. Our foreman was John and he kept us up to date through out the project. The subcontractors were pros as well.  The price was agreed upon upfront and that didn't change even though there were some changes along the way."
5,"We chose Sarah at S&W because of her design ideas, listening, and understanding what effect and style we wanted to achieve.  She has been wonderful to work with--very talented with lots of great ideas.  We realize we're not always easy to work with, but Sarah has been wonderful throughout the project."
5,This is the 2nd phase of our kitchen remodel. Kristin Rutkowski and S&W crew were very professional in meeting our needs. Our Project Manager Robert Ungvarsky kept us up to date on crews coming in to work on our house. They were very professional and listened to our needs and requests.  We love the new change updates such as moving Washer and Dryer and placing additional Cabinets into our Galley Kitchen Design.  Love the extra space.  Thank you Kristen and Robert for a very good experience .
5,Couldn’t be happier with the job Matt Carpenter did for me on our latest project. Professionally managed from beginning to end. Highly recommended!!!!!
5,"We contracted S&W Kitchens to do our kitchen remodel and we are super happy with their work. Kristin Rutkowski was our designer. She presented to us great choices for countertops, backsplash, and fixtures that worked well together and were stylish. Pete Coffman, our project superintendent, was always on top of every detail and made sure we knew what was going on every step of the way.  The workers were reliable, knowledgeable of their craft, polite, and took pride in their work. We are so glad S&W did our kitchen and we highly recommend them!"
5,"Worked with Kristin Rutkowski at The Expo Design Center. Very talented and professional. If you are needing a good and competent designer, you are in good hands!"
5,"We needed a complete kitchen and master bathroom renovation and after 3 quotes for the job we selected S&W Kitchens. Whitney, Jeff and project supervisor Eric were all so professional, helpful and knowledgable. Whitney's help in everything from the design to the selection of cabinets, counter tops and matching tile to existing flooring. The plumbing fixtures I had in mind she was able to match to a brand that fit our budget. 
All the workers were professional, friendly and cleaned up after they had finished working.
Our floors and furniture were well protected and the whole house was very clean when the project was completed.
Whitney was so pleasant to work with. She is very detail oriented and communicated with us throughout the project. We were kept informed of what and when the next phase was to happen and the project finished on time. There were no unpleasant surprises!
We highly recommend this company."
5,"I have worked on several homes with S&W over the last couple of years and the experience has been fantastic! Matt brings years of experience, knowledge, and creativity to make each and every project unique. I know when I bring a client here they are taken care of from start to finish because of Matt’s dedication to the project; from the initial sketches to detailed drawings to on-site meetings and installation. I will continue to bring my clients to Matt and the S&W team for their outstanding customer service!"
5,"After a previous kitchen project with S&W we were certain that they would be the ones to remodel our bathrooms. As expected, the same quality was delivered. Larissa was there every step of the way, creating a design that was what we had imagined and seeing every detail through to its final stages. Larissa's assistant, Yina and construction manager Mike were excellent and responded quickly to our questions. 
When looking for a company to remodel your home you want someone to trust and S&W is just that."
5,S&W were incredible.  Krista listened to what we wanted.  They provided a detailed set of drawings to review.  They changed the drawings until the design was perfect.  The budget was fixed and our family and S&W found ways to make it work.  Then the work began.  The team was professional.  The workmanship was at the highest level.  If the work was not as indicated on the drawings then it was reworked.  Changes happened and adjustments were made.  The project finished on schedule.
5,"Lindsey Schwartz and Savanna helped me update my kitchen. I wanted to keep my cabinets but add a new ""coffee bar"" and cabinet in one corner. I also chose new counter tops and back splash. The coffee bar area is wonderful and the cabinets fit the area perfectly. The match to the old cabinets is almost perfect. The new back splash makes the area brighter and more cohesive. The contractors were great and it was a pleasure to have them in the house. They kept to the schedule and did a great job."
5,"Sarah Kraus was our designer and liaison for the complete remodel of our master bath. She and Tim Hobson (contractor),  both with S& W Kitchens and Baths,organized and followed through with quite a complex project.
We had worked with Sarah before, remodeling 3 baths. She has an incredible work ethic and great ideas-also, she is a joy to work with!  We had a time constraint but all was complete on time and looks beautiful!"
5,"Integrated Kitchen ------ Lake Mary Fl

The kitchen renovation we have been planning for many years impacted almost our entire house.  We needed a contractor who would handle the project turn key and deal with all the trades.  
The team from S&W Kitchens did an amazing job.

First and foremost, Mayerlin Ferreira our designer was wonderful to work with. 
From the day we walked into the S&W showroom until our final completion she was fully engaged in our renovation.  
She looked closely at our tentative plans and listened to our intentions. The design choices that Mayerlin offered made our product selections easy. 
Our new integrated kitchen has all the features we desired and exudes extraordinary style.  

The project management team kept us informed on scheduling, inspections, and progress.  Considering the magnitude of the work, their realistic yet customer friendly communications kept us informed all the way through.

Finally, the trades(wo)men who performed the work were all professional and did high quality work.  This project was from ceiling to floor.  The drywall, paint, electrical, plumbing, tile, cabinetry, counter top and cleaning people all performed beyond expectations.

S&W Kitchens was certainly not the least expensive option.  
However, considering the magnificent results, we are extremely satisfied.  
We highly recommend S&W.

Sincerely
John & Janis P"
4,We started off great guns but then had a problem with the permit which put timeframes off quite a bit. Cleaned after each day. End product came out great and was totally satisfied with end results. Only concern I could voice is more communication. I like to know often what is going to happen next and when.
5,"The wife’s dream has finally come true! Thanks to S & W Kitchens, their designer Gayle McCaughin and superintendent Dale Thomas. Gayle designed our 33 year old kitchen into a very elegant fully functional space and Dale worked together with the various trades to minimize our down time! Everyone was very courteous and accommodating to our needs. We chose S & W because of Gayle’s design presentation, Dale’s quality assurance and the selection of cabinets and accessories. Also, the numerous positive reviews and that S & W had multiple locations in central Florida."
5,I had a design  that was perfect  for a loft place in my home but I could not find a co. to build it. Just happen to stop in S & W Kitchens and meet a designer named Mayerlin Ferreira. She was best person I had found to help with my project. She understood me was up front with cost and  it was a wonderful working experience. I would use her again for any project  in my home.
5,"I and my wife, Anne,  are most satisfied with our  kitchen cabinet project with S & W Kitchens. We appreciated working with Sarah Kraus from our 1st in-home meeting with her, our style and finish selections and installation experience. She answered our questions and addressed each concern. The whole experience was a very pleasant one."
5,"S&W, Longwood, did a fantastic job remodeling my condo. I had a basic idea of how I wanted my new kitchen to look; Greg Flassig’s design gave me more than I had thought possible. Greg listened carefully to how I wanted my kitchen to feel and he presented me with options that created my dream kitchen. Greg and his team paid careful attention to every detail. In addition to the kitchen, S&W removed and replaced my popcorn ceilings throughout with a knockdown finish. They installed new flooring and coordinated with my carpeting company with my painters to ensure a seamless completion. I will definitely use Greg and his team again and highly recommend them."
5,"We absolutely love our bathroom remodels (Master and Guest).  An outdated space was turned into our own personal spa.  Our designer, Sarah Kraus was a dream to work with.  A complete professional that helped us bring our vision to life making it nicer than we could have imagined.  We are busy professionals with hectic schedules.  Sarah, was considerate of our time and flexible with her schedule.  Remodeling can be stressful.  Sarah ensured we had a pleasant experience.  She has great vision and will help you make the most of any space."
4,"I absolutely love my new master retreat!  Thanks to the incredible design ideas of Sarah Kraus, I have an incredible master bedroom and master bath.  Sarah took a 1980’s bathroom with a huge tub and tiny shower and redesigned it into a luxury spa oasis.  I asked for a “wow” factor and she delivered.  The old tub area is now an incredible shower with a river rock floor, quartz seating and beautiful quartz and river rock shelving.  The shower wall with the window is framed in a unique tile that brings the beauty of the view into the room.  The cabinetry is elegant and functional with a ton of storage.  She turned a tiny shower into a linen closet and added a new dimension to the room by adding a barn door with a mirror.    The quartz waterfall, countertop, and shelving are a beautiful finish to an incredible space.  Sarah is very nice to work with and she listened to what I wanted and took my suggestions and designed the rooms to my personality.  If you are looking to transform a space into something special, Sarah Kraus is the person for the job.  You will not be disappointed in her artistic, creative abilities.  I would highly recommend her.   
The review would be 5 stars if I only considered the designer and the final product.  However, since this is a review for S&W Kitchens, I can only give 4 stars.   We had so many issues with our master suite remodel.  We went through 3 superintendents and the first 2 were not very organized and did not communicate with us.  We would show up expecting to see progress just to find out that things had not been done and no one bothered to let us know.  Even with the detailed instruction book, we had a lot of mistakes.  The tile folks used the wrong grout on the entire floor, added a step down into the shower and cut and tiled one wall so that everything was off center.   By the time Tim Hobson came into the picture, we were weeks behind schedule and completely frustrated.  Tim immediately started communicating with us and all of the mistakes were corrected and the job was completed.  S&W did provide additional work at no cost to make up for the mistakes that were made during the renovation.  Sarah's design and choice of products deserves a 5+ star rating."
5,"Sarah was magnificent. She worked tirelessly to ensure the bathroom design we were looking for translated into exactly what we wanted. Her suggestions and recommendations were always with our best interests in mind. She maintained regular communication to keep us ""in the loop"" and aware of any work schedule changes.

Sarah had a great eye for detail and was extremely knowledgeable of all pertinent bathroom-related products. Her suggestions were based on knowledge, and not just guesswork. 

The finished product is nothing short of a thing of beauty and surpasses all we could hope for. We can't wait to show it off!

Thanks Sarah for taking the time to work with us. You did a fantastic job!"
5,changed a shower into a bathtub for the grandkids.  great designer and tileman.  a little pricey but got an high end quality product.
4,"Have worked with Andy Meeder with S & W Kitchens on several 
projects. He is a tremendous designer with a sharp eye.
A great talent. I hope we have many more together."
5,"We were fortunate to have Laura Scott and Dale Thomas create a gorgeous master bathroom for us where none existed before.  There wasn’t any existing plumbing and the electrical had to be totally redone as it wasn’t up to code.  We live in an old 1935 house and they turned what used to be a very small 10 x 5 enclosed front porch into a spa like retreat.  It definitely was an adventure as we encountered many stumbling blocks along the way as one does when challenged with renovating an old home.  You never know what you might uncover including a few extra layers of floors, extra layers of ceiling and extra layers of walls.  The original design would have been beautiful but because of all the adjustments we had to make the design morphed and developed along the way and it came out even better than the original plan and I wouldn’t change a thing or the process that got us here.  Laura was fabulous to work with and from the moment we met her we felt like we had known each other for years.  She was such a joy to work with and we felt that we were always on the same page when it came to coming up with materials or ideas.  She definitely got our vision.  I couldn’t have asked for a better team.  Dale our construction guru was incredible when it came to having awesome and unique ideas that fit perfectly with not only our style but the style of the house.  We kept having to change materials and adding and subtracting things and he was always so creative but always keeping in mind the era of the house and the fact that we were trying to stay true to that and we had a great time feeding ideas off of each other with the end result that the finished product was something we can all be very proud of.  I cannot thank the team at S&W Kitchens enough for not only giving us the master bathroom of our dreams but also for making the experience one we will always cherish.

1,"Hiring S and W Kitchens was possibly the worse decision I’ve made as a homeowner. The project was started in December and was to be completed by mid-April. It is now well into August and the work has yet to be completed. I was told by Larissa Berendsen that all the materials would be ordered prior to demolition, was I didn’t know was that much of what was ordered would be the incorrect size, color, or style. My foyer tile was installed three times before they used the correct tile. Bedrooms were all painted the wrong color. The wrong interior doors were ordered. The wrong interior hardware was ordered. The wrong laundry-room cabinets were ordered. The glass panels on the custom front doors were incorrect. Hardwood floors in all bedrooms were damaged upon installation and had to be ripped out and replaced. The kitchen lights continue overheat and cut-out after 20 minutes of use. On one occasion, my neighbors called to let me know that my front doors were left wide open without anyone on site for hours. I came home to find my doors unlocked at least five times. There is a lot more, but this gives you some idea. I met with the owner, Joe Steenbeke, two months ago to address these glitches and he assured me that the problems would be addressed, yet two months later, I am without a finished home. I saved for seven years to afford a home remodel, it is heartbreaking to know that I gave my money to people who care nothing about their customers."
5,We are extremely pleased with the remodel of our master bathroom.  Working with Lindsey and Dale was a pleasure. They were very professional and even when we ran into an electrical problem that was not their fault they helped us get the issue resolved and worked diligently with our condo association to help us move the project forward. We finished within the budget and love the new look.  I would highly recommend Lindsey and S&W.
1,"I hired S&W to remodel my master bath.  during the initial meeting, I was told it would only take 3-4 weeks, then when I went to sign the contract it stated 5-7 weeks. When I questioned the time I was told by the designer ""it's in all our contracts, but it won't take that long I promise"".  Then when the job manager came out to do the first look at the bath I was told it would take the full 7 weeks.  I questioned this with the designer and he said it probably would, so he lied!  We went through not having people show up to having inferior work done.  The tub had to be removed three times due to measurements not being correct, counter had to be removed due to wrong measurements, glass around shower had to be removed due to wrong measurements.  Each time it would take another week or two to get them back out. It finally took over 12 weeks to remodel a 10X12 bath. I called the owners and never received a call back. I wrote them and never heard a word. I have other issues but will just say I wouldn't recommed S&W for any project I'm doing."
5,"The, designer, Sarah Kraus, did an amazing job of helping me design my master bathroom. She showed me the whole process from start to finish. We went over each product that was going to installed in the bathroom. Since this is my first remodel of a room, I was overwhelmed with all the steps it takes and the process involved. Sarah showed me the process and the steps it takes to do the project. Without her help and guidance, I would be stressed over the project. Sarah is a true professional in that she has the knowledge and the ability to deal with my budget of the project. I would highly recommend Sarah Kraus as a designer for either your bathroom or your kitchen design."
5,Bill Burke was our designer and he did an excellent job transforming our kitchen into my dream kitchen! I would highly recommend S&W Kitchens to anyone!
5,"Could not be happier with S & W Kitchens.  Our kitchen renovation is a total success and mainly due to the efforts of our designer, Sarah Kraus.  She stayed on top of the progress being made every step of the way and kept us informed almost daily.  Since this was our first renovation this was very much apppreciated and would not hesitate to contact her again for any future plans.  Great job Sarah!"
5,Beautiful job on my bathroom.   Great designer and superintendent.  No complaints. Left my bathroom spotless.  All the workers were top notch.  Will definitely use S & W for my next project.  Kirsten worked very well with me.
5,"Worked with designer Lola Gainer and Construction Superintendent Eric Rodeback from Palm Harbor office.  They were very professional and great attention to detail.  Remodeled a condo kitchen when we were away, as this is a second home.  New cabinets, hardware, sink, faucet, flooring, tile backsplash, countertops, under cabinet lighting and appliances.  Completed on time and on budget.  Would highly recommend."
5,I find S&W Kitchens very professional and knowledgeable about their products. The prices are reasonable. The work is exceptional.
5,"My husband and I chose S & W Kitchens to design and remodel our 1983 kitchen.  I could not be happier.  We were treated with such respect and professionalism.  Our kitchen cost approximately 77,000 dollars and it was worth every cent.  Everyone went out of their way to make this experience go smoothly and it did!"
5,"S&W did a fantastic job on our kitchen renovation. Greg Flassig and everyone involved were highly professional, knowledgeable and respectful. We were kept informed every step of the way and we absolutely love everything about our new kitchen. Would highly recommend Greg and the S&W team!"
5,"My wife and I recently had one of our residential bathrooms totally demolished and renovated. We decided to use S&W Kitchens because they are local, have a reputation for a top quality finished product, and have been in business since the 1970's. 

Also, one of the main selling points for us was the designer, Sarah Kraus. Sarah developed the layout and basic design ideas. She discussed all the menu of products, designs, prices, colors, etc, and incorporated our preferences into a final design. My wife and Sarah worked very closely to coordinate each detail. 

Sarah is very thorough. She verified all the products necessary for the job, both at the warehouse and at our home before the renovation could proceed. She communicated with us daily and was always available to us when we called. 

The project finished slightly ahead of schedule and on budget. My wife and I are extremely happy with our new bathroom. S&W provided us with a professional team and they did a very professional job for us. 

But we cannot overemphasize the value Sarah Kraus played toward making this such a great success. She built the foundation with her attention to detail, keen eye for design, and quickly developing a free and open communications with my wife and me. Therefore, we give Sarah our highest recommendation."
5,From start to finish I was completely happy with the design team and contract team from the Palm Harbor office. Kristin Phillips made my kitchen the amazing centerpiece of the house. Thank you guys
5,"Bill is very knowledgeable  in all aspects of kitchen design!  I am on the radio with Bill quite often on a home improvement show and we have had many great discussions about kitchen design, the design process, the excellent teams of installers they use, etc.  I've spoken with some of his clients and have seen some of the kitchens they have designed that are just beautiful!    If you want to speak to the most knowledgeable kitchen designers in town, S and W Kitchens is the place to call!"
5,"Greg Flassig designed the renovation of our Master Bedroom bath.  We are thrilled with the outcome.  We wanted a ""roll in"" shower to accommodate our needs in our ""golden"" years.  Greg's design was both elegant and highly functional.  Greg was also very responsive to all of our concerns as construction progressed.  Great job!"
5,"We hired S&W Kitchens to renovate our Master Bath. Sarah Kraus was our designer.  Sarah was a joy and pleasure to work with.  From the beginning she really listened to our vision, our ideas and somewhat lengthy list of desires for our bathroom.  She was able to incorporate what she heard from us, saw in our way of living and personal design, to create a gorgeous, functional and unique Master Bathroom that we will enjoy and appreciate for many, many years to come. Our vision came to fruition with Sarah's amazing skills and artistic flair. Truly a dream collaboration. Sarah and the whole team; Chris, the superintendent, as well as all of the very skilled tradesmen were there for us through the entire process.  There were a few bumps in the road, as expected in a project of this size, but they responded quickly and did what it took from each of their perspectives to correct or overcome any issues that came up. Sarah became a friend through this process and I would not hesitate to recommend her and have her design our next project. I would also like to mention that all of the people we worked with throughout this project were first rate and a pleasure to talk to and work with. Their skills were evident which shows in the end result. We have a great deal of respect for everyone who participated in our project. Although slightly more expensive than other quotes, I believe it was well worth it, as S&W stands by what they do and deliver a quality product and service. We have already had someone ask if they can rent out the 'spa'!"
5,"I hired S&W Kitchens to do a whole house renovation. This included the kitchen, the master bathroom and the guest bedroom and floors.  They did a spectacular job of transforming a pig sty into a palace.  I worked with designer Krista and contractor Tim.  They made sure everything was done either on schedule or ahead of schedule and on budget. If there were any concerns each were easily reached by phone or text and the issue would be resolved post haste"
1,"Our experience was not a positive one.  When we went in for a final review of our plans there were several issues.  The designer left out several details that were very important to us, including the wrong size upper cabinets, which created other issues.  We were very clear about what we wanted and the designer's reaction was to blame us for making too many changes.  We feel changes are part of the process and so many would not have been necessary if our designer would have listened and not continually added their personal preferences into our design.  The worst part of the experience was when trying to finalize the design for a 2nd time, we were pressured by the manager to make a quick decision.  In the end we discontinued working with them and would not recommend them as we feel they were dishonest and did not deliver what they promised."
5,"We had a 20+ year old bathroom with ugly cracking tile and a jetted tub that was never used. We didn't know know exactly what we wanted, but knew what we did not want. Kristin showed us options we did not realize were  possible.  The end result is wonderful! The construction went smoothly. S&W clearly explained how the remodel would progress. Our new master bathroom is great!
We are currently planning our next renovation with S&W."
5,"S&W Kitchens did a total remodel of my 27 year old kitchen and brought it beautifully into the 21st century. My designer, Mary Burkhammer, was exceptional and was with me in every aspect of the design and construction. The S&W crew rolled like a well-oiled machine during the entire process. They were extremely knowledgable, professional, and dependable. This was a big project (building up walls, tearing up flooring, redesigning the footprint, adding new lighting and electrical outlets, re plumbing, etc) and it was totally STRESS FREE for me from start to finish! My new cabinets are of the highest quality as is everything used in the renovation project. Floor, countertops, back splashes, lighting, appliances, hardware - all top notch.  I couldn't be happier with the final results and would highly recommend S&W Kitchens to any one who wants a truly quality company!"
5,"Sarah Kraus from S & W Kitchens designed our beautiful Jack and Jill Bathroom. We found them a very professional firm and we're delighted with the final product. The project was completed on time which was wonderful. S & W Kitchens come highly recommended by us.

Mrs Rachel Miller"
5,"S & W Kitchens just designed and installed my beautiful, new kitchen. I am very pleased with the final product. Everyone is very professional and very quick to handle all questions and concerns. And though it was tough at times to be without a fully usable kitchen, S & W made the process less painful by staying on track. They actually completed the project a little ahead of schedule (Thank you, project manager, Tony!). I highly recommend them to everyone. And kudos to my designer, Jean for her attention to style and detail. Thank you S & W!!!"
5,"S&W kitchens did my design and remodel of my 23 year old kitchen. The design was fabulous and the remodel went perfect. Krista from S&W did the design and she really knows her craft. Very knowledgeable and understands all the different aspects of the construction process. She is very attentive and when she is not available she has a very capable right hand person (Whitney) that is ""Johnny on the Spot"". Bottom line, They do what they say they will do and they do it well. We are extremely happy with the end results."
5,"Outstanding! We have nothing but positive recommendations for Lindsey Schwartz at Brevard S & W Kitchens!

It all began with Lindsey listening to our wishes, then moved on to her designing and creating our condo kitchen, master bath, & guest bath renovation. Not only did she listen to what our desires were, but added so many great practical and decorative ideas, all the time keeping within our budget allowance. Lindsey & Kevin visited our condo to get ideas of what we wanted to do for the renovation, they spent time learning what we wanted, discovering what style kitchen, baths would suit us best with our renovation. Kevin measured everything to make sure what we decided to do would work for our space & meet our condo building code.

 We replaced our kitchen & bathroom cabinets, removed some walls, replaced  counters, sinks, lighting, mirrors, appliances, removed all popcorn ceilings replacing with textured ceilings, & had entire condo painted. With this being an ocean front condo, Lindsey designed our kitchen counter with a slight wave along the edge & added wavy tile backsplash to carry on the ocean wave theme using neutral Quartz stone with tiny seashells on top of white cabinets. It is just beautiful & quite the conversation piece!

Project manager, Dale was awesome to work with coordinating the entire project & managing all of the subs, plus doing a lot of work himself. The subs were all top quality & were all fantastic, from the cabinet installers, counter templaters,  painters, electrician, plumber, appliance installer, all took tremendous pride in their work. All kept very clean work space & thoroughly cleaned up space each day when they were finished.

We felt we were in good hands with our renovation from start to finish. Lindsey did not rest until she was sure we were happy with everything, no matter how small the detail. Not only was she knowledgeable in all areas, including electrical, plumbing, cabinetry, along with kitchen & bath design, she was a joy to work with. We highly recommend Lindsey & her team!"
5,We were pleased with the plans S&W drew up for the remodeling of our two  bathrooms.  Everything went smoothly with the work.  S&W personnel and contractors went out of their way to see that we were pleased.
5,"We were looking for a full service company to coordinate the work needed to update our  kitchen cabinets and two guest baths. We are very pleased with our decision to work with Nate Schuck, our project designer, and the team at S&W Kitchens. Nate listened to our needs, provided great ideas and worked within our budget. Travis Boley, our superintendent, coordinated the activities and was quick to respond to our questions. The quality of the products and service and the attention to detail was outstanding. We had an excellent experience and would highly recommend Nate and S&W Kitchens."
5,"Guidance throughout a stressful kitchen renovation.  Excellent choice of cabinets, colors & marble and granite & backsplash. Professional installation that has held up.."
5,"I contacted S&W Kitchens and spoke to Nate.  He came to my house and previewed the remodel of our guest bathroom.  We had been having major mold problems which drastically affected my wife's health.  We got three bids, but even though they were not the lowest, I was impressed with the way S&W personnel communicated with us.  We signed the contract to completely remodel the guest bathroom with Nate and set a date to commence the remodel with Nate and the Superintendent on the job Chris Hooper.  Because of the problem with mold they moved the work forward and started construction.  We were completely happy with the results and we would recommend S&W to anybody we know who; needs work done.  To us, first comes dollar cost and then communication.  I stressed this to all three contractors.  S&W was the only company to comply and stay in regular touch with us throughout the remodel.  Again, Nate, Chris and the people that did the remodeling were all outstanding.  Everybody that worked on our home was friendly, very knowledgeable, and took great care in the work they did."
5,"My name is Jack Flemm, i am  home owner in windermere, fl. I have had the extreme pleasure of doing two kitchens and three bathrooms with Nate Schuck. Each experience was better than the last, Nate is a real pro. He has an incredible eye for design, while always respecting my wallet, even when i do not!!! seriously, Nate is willing to speak his mind and work with your ideas. the first kitchen and two bathrooms were mostly his ideas and the second kitchen and one bath were mostly mine. i love them both. 
Nate, does a great job of making you, the customer, feel comfortable, while under promising and over delivering. at the moment, i have run out of projects, but i will always remember Nate Schuck when the next one shows up. You will love working with Nate and his team, i guarantee it."
5,Our designer was fabulous-Mary listened to our needs and planned the kitchen to what we were envisioning.  Tim was our project manager- he communicated beautifully and was very willing to listen when we had concerns.  The cabinets are gorgeous and installed perfectly.  We also loved the counter tops- beautiful.  Everything that was recommended to us- delivered.  Very pleased!
5,"The S & W Kitchen designer we worked with, Greg Flassig ,was very conscientious in helping us decide what materials and colors to use in our new kitchen remodel.  He gave us plenty of options, but did not overwhelm us.  He listened to our needs and wants, and was able to incorporate some fresh and innovative ideas into our living space without destroying the uniqueness of our home. Greg was very personable and patient, even when our decisions changed dramatically at the last minute when we added extra floor tile into our family room. The whole S & W team worked well together to finish the project on time, and they continued to be available when a few details needed to be redone after the project was completed.  We felt very comfortable with all of their workers and employees.  We highly recommend S & W Kitchens for quality service and distinctive designs."
5,We just used S&W to add a bathroom and they were awesome. They made an addition to the house adding a bathroom in our garage. The bathroom is beautiful and they finished ahead of schedule. I have a newborn and they were always so accommodating. They would call us to tell us who would be there the next day and when they would be there. The room was finished several weeks ahead of schedule and could not have come out better. We are so happy that we chose them!!
5,"S & W Kitchens Remodeled my kitchen; removed a wall, raised the ceiling, new cabinets and countertops; new plumbing and electric.
The designer assigned to me was Kirsten Phillips from the Palm Harbor location. She was WONDERFUL. She really listened to me. I was not present for the construction, however, she kept me informed every step of the way with calls, texts and pictures. Everything was finished to my complete satisfaction. Kirsten and the others went above and beyond to make sure that I was happy with my new kitchen.  I do not have one bad word to say about any of the people involved with my remodel. Do not hesitate to contract with this company"
5,"S&W completed a massive renovation for me in a most competent, efficient and timely manner.  Chris Druschel and Tim Hobson were my main contacts/advisors/designers, and working with them was truly a pleasure.  The project was completed on schedule, in my absence and with constant feedback and progress reports.  The quality of product and workmanship were extremely satisfactory.  

I am completely satisfied with the final result and would recommend S&W without reservation!"
5,"Adam from the Palm Harbor location came into our home in Brooksville and enlarged as well as completely remolded our kitchen.  We had used Adam and S and W previously, so we knew what to expect.  Adam and his team were on time and ready to go.  Project took less time than expected, and came in on budget.  Anyone looking for quality work needs to go to S and W."
5,"My wife and I were looking at doing a large renovation to our foyer, living room, gallery, moving the kitchen, laundry room, dining room, and two bath rooms. We talked to several companies before S & W Kitchens and after meeting with Chris Druschel, his ideas, the store, and meeting some of the management we were sold on S&W as the best people to hire. 
Working with Chris was a real pleasure and what a great design we as a team came up with.  The project once started went very smoothly from start to finish. All of the outstanding subcontractors were very professional and Tim Hobson ( construction project manager) worked the daily problems and kept everything on track The project was finished well ahead of schedule and we are extremely pleased with the quality of workmanship and attention to details that was put into beautiful restoration. S&W and all of the people involved in this project are highly professional, very talented and a real pleasure to work with.  
A very special thanks to Chris and Tim for an outstanding job. We couldn't be happier!"
5,"Lindsey did an awesome job in translating my concepts, descriptions, and examples of what I was looking for in my kitchen remodel.  While modern is not typical in Brevard, Lindsey was excited to do a project of that nature.  

The job consisted of new cabinets, countertops, and appliances.  While no walls were moved and the basic layout was retained, it was still a fairly extensive job.  

The entire S&W team were very professional and I was always kept up to date as to what was going to happen when.  There were very few issues that came up during the project.  The communication was always timely.  Whether it was Lindsey, the job foreman, or any subcontractors, they always communicated directly and honestly when any issues needed resolving and sought my input in determining solutions.  I felt that my satisfaction was their primary goal.  

The kitchen turned out fabulous and I would not hesitate to recommend them highly to friends.  I plan to update a bath in the near future and plan to give Lindsey and S&W my business when I do."
5,"As we embarked on a major remodel of our kitchen and both bathrooms, we were quite impressed with S&W’s design and materials selection. We tweaked the plans a bit, but only to accommodate our concerns about wear and tear in the kitchen as we use our kitchen a lot. S&W quickly made some changes in the materials and we were set to go! The materials selection process was a breeze. S&W narrowed down the material selections to two to three choices; which for us design-challenged types was very helpful. If we didn’t like any of the choices, they would bring in two or three additional choices.  
Throughout the entire process, S&W was very professional. Before any work started, we had plans, we understood the costs and we understood what would happen if we ran into unexpected snags. Enduring a remodel can be challenging, but a few things that we really appreciated were:
•Everything was resolved to our satisfaction. There was never any quibbling with anything we were not pleased with. 
•All workman and subs were very polite, conscientious and always cleaned up at the end the day….and when you’re living through a remodel, that’s very much appreciated.
•S&W is very responsive to calls/emails.
The project was completed in about three months and we couldn’t be happier. It turned out fantastic! We did go slightly over budget, however that was mostly due to changes/additions that we made. Since the remodel we’ve had a few little things break or require some adjustment, which S&W attended to right away, no questions asked.

We give S&W high marks. There were no surprises on cost, design, project timing, etc. They have a great price-value proposition and they are there for you during and after the project. So, without hesitation we highly recommend S&W!"
5,"Outstanding describes our experience working with Chris Druschel of S and W Kitchens. From the design stage through demolition, construction, and completion, Chris worked diligently to bring our unique vision to fruition. The quality of the materials and workmanship was of the highest order. At no time did we feel pressured to hurry the process. Deadlines were met. We would strongly recommend Chris Druschel of S and W Kitchens for any project."
5,"We decided to update parts of our home and met Chris at S & W Kitchens.   It was a pleasure from start to finish.    We had both bathrooms and kitchen cabinets refaced and quartz counter tops in both bathroom.    The work is perfect and we were so happy we decided this year to have the kitchen counter top replaced with the same quartz we used in the bathrooms.   It had been tiled a few years ago, but after seeing the quartz in the bathrooms we could not resist completing the project by having the tile removed and the same quartz installed.   Every thing went so well,  jobs completed on time and all involved were very kind, polite and skilled.    It makes us wish there was more work we could have done."
4,"Project consisted of all new wood floors through out the house; new granite counter tops in the kitchen; new back splash; and new appliances;

The designer, Kristin, was very patient with her picky clients and in the end it was worth it. She worked with us on finding the right floor grade and stain color, granite slabs, and back splash design. The gentleman that installed the wood floors was second to none for being detail oriented, thorough, and you knew he took pride in his work. The other subs did quality work as well and knew their craft. The project manager did a good job of trying to keep everything moving towards completion.

I did not give 5 stars due to the lack of communication and it was obvious the PM had too many projects assigned. The end result was quality craftsmanship and product."
5,"Chris' response to our problem was quickly resolved.  In all of our dealings with SandW Kitchens we have been extremely pleased with their professionalism and rapid response to our questions and concerns. High quality work completed on time with excellent results.  We will use them again on our next project.
We recently had an issue with lighting but it was resolved with one phone call!  GREAT  RESPONSE AND SERVICE!"
5,"We hired s+w kitchens to do a complete tear down and build up of our 2 bedroom beach condo.  Adam Vinson of the Palm Harbor office and his crew did a superb job.  They worked carefully with us to consider all the options for flooring, paint, countertops, windows, etc and helped us make the proper selections that fit both our taste and our budget.  S+W overcame challenges with permits, condo building restrictions, and unexpected structural oddities.  The crews that worked on our place were very capable and professional.  With the completed job we have a redecorated condo unit that looks fantastic and meets our every need.  We are very happy and satisfied and cannot thank S+W and Adam Vinson enough for creating such a wonderful place to live.  I would highly recommend S+W to anyone looking to renovate their house or condo."
5,"We purchased Omega cabinetry from S&W kitchens for our bathrooms.  We love the high quality American made product from Omega cabinetry.  The S&W designers are very knowledgeable about the product, and were able to help us customize the layout, color, and design for our particular needs. With their large selection of products that they carry S&W staff was able to help us decide on the product that was right for us and our budget. The cabinets were delivered to our house in the time frame that was estimated.  My husband did all the installation of the cabinetry, and S&W was very helpful with questions he had during installation.  We will soon be doing our kitchen and will most definitely be purchasing through S&W Kitchens!"
1,"We were very excited to remodel our Master Bathroom.  It started out as just adding a jetted tub to the space and grew into our ""Dream Bathroom"" by completely redoing the walk-in shower, Vanity top, sinks, toilet and water closet, along with reconfiguring walls.  We didn't know that our ""Dream"" would turn into a ""Nightmare"".  Early-on in our planning, we found a supplier/installer for the quartz that we wanted to line the walls, tub deck and Vanity top; and needed a local Bathroom contractor for the remainder of the project.  After contacting a few local Kitchen and Bath professionals, we decided to contract with S&W Kitchens, even though their estimate was $4000 higher than any of the others.  We made this decision due to our comfort with the Designer and Estimator/Project Coordinator that we dealt with during the detailed planning process, S&W Kitchens' reputation, advertizing and the promise of a structured process with ""the Highest Possible Level of Customer Service & Communication"".

We were assigned a Construction Superintendent, who initially met with us and our Designer to go over the job, ALL details of the contract and develop a schedule.  Our job was estimated to be 5 to 7 weeks from start to completion, which based on our prior knowledge of construction practices, we thought was a little excessive, but we accepted it.

Initially the job started out as promised, with daily morning planning calls from the Superintendent, which we had requested.  There were minor day-to-day issues which popped up and were dealt with.  We understand that this is normal for construction.  However, we began to notice a pattern, starting with the quality of sub-contractors on the job.  Next the communication started to drop off.  It became a REAL PROBLEM after we made the substantial post demo payment.  The Construction Superintendent had all sorts of excuses as to why he didn't call us with a daily update, as we had requested.  Often, he didn't even return our voicemail requests for a call-back. He didn't seem to understand many of The Contract details or be able to manage the project properly.  The Superintendent consistently tried to put the blame on our Designer or others in the Company for his inability to control the job.  As our main contact on the job, we were told that it was his responsibility to understand our project and Contract completely in order to execute the job.  The ""final straw"" came when the sub-contractor to install the shower floor showed up and was NOT the original person that came out to pre-plan the installation.  They had NO knowledge of the product that we had specified. Our Designer and Estimator/Project Coordinator had researched the product thoroughly and knew that it was ""different"" from regular epoxy. The sub-contractor refused to follow the very specific instructions that came with the product, stating that ""they knew epoxy floors"".  We tried to contact the Construction Superintendent (who was not on the job site when ANY of the sub-contractors were performing), because the shower floor sub-contractor started to apply the product improperly, but we only got the Superintendent's voicemail.  So, we panicked and called our Designer to report we had a major issue on-site! Later we were chastised by the Superintendent, because he said we should only go thru him (S&W Kitchens' literature states ""our project managers, construction team members and designers are always available for any questions you may have"").  When the Superintendent finally did show up on the job, he didn't stop the shower floor sub-contractor, and he gave us his ""personal guarantee"" and that of S&W that they ""knew what they were doing and we would LOVE the finished product"". That wasn't the case.  It turned out totally unacceptable with sharp edges, uneven coverage and no slope in some areas.  At that point, we knew that there was no way that the Superintendent was credible any longer and our relationship with him had deteriorated to the point that we could no longer rely on him to complete the project. He had taken some shortcuts throughout the project, was NEVER on-site for the mandatory County Inspections (we had to walk the inspector through every detail) and had NOT adhered to the Contract requirements. We contacted our Legal Representative and sought her advice regarding our possible courses of action. We had to request a new Construction Superintendent and threatened legal action.  As a direct result, The Director of Field Operations took over our job.  A Certified Installer for the shower floor product was retained to chip-out and re-do it.  This time it turned out perfectly.  We went over ALL the missed details, issues, and Contract concerns with the Field Operations Director.  He was very professional, addressed these items, and we were finally able to get the job completed.

It's a shame that we didn't have someone like the Field Operations Director to work with our wonderful Designer and Project Coordinator, (who were both very knowledgeable and professional) from the beginning.  We might have been spared the painful experiences and anguish. The Total Project Time was 12 1/2 weeks and only then due to getting our legal representative's support and advice, not the original 5 to 7 weeks estimated.  We can only hope that if there are any Warranty Issues in the future that S&W Kitchens will stand by their Warranty.  Unlike their advertising, we were NOT ""100% happy"" with the overall process and ""The S&W Difference"" was NOT ""Simply Wonderful!"""
1,"S&W Kitchens of Melbourne, FL were extremely difficult to work with.  We hired them to reface the kitchen cabinets and install a granite counter top and back-splash. The project manager would not communicate with us and never met any of the deadlines.  We would have to track him down just to get an update.  It was a fairly small and simple project, yet it took over a month to complete not to mention the two months it took from the initial consultation to the project began.  

The project manager wound of quitting the company in the middle of the installation phase and no one from the company would return our calls. It took a couple of  visits to the showroom to talk to the manager to get the project back on track.  During the installation phase the wrong parts were ordered two different times which delayed the project even more.  Not once did anyone come to perform a Quality Assurance check of the work that had been done.  

Since the installation we have had cabinet doors fall off twice.  We come to realize that they did not secure the dishwasher to the cabinet or counter-top.  So the dishwasher tilts forward anytime the door is opened.  We have contacted the manager once again and it has been two weeks and they have yet to send anyone to correct the deficiencies or contact us as to when to expect repairs to be made.  

I would personally not recommend this company because they only seem to care about getting paid and not providing a quality product. I say this because they would not return our calls and seemed to blow us off during our visits to the showroom.  However they were quick to call if they had not received their money!"
3,This company remodeled our bathroom this past winter.  They have a new location in Tampa and we worked with the new store.
4,"Kristin did a great job on designing the kitchen. She was very helpful in suggesting ideas when I was trying to figure out how to work my cookbooks into the kitchen. in my old kitchen I stored my cookbooks across the top of my cabinets and it was very inconvenient.  She suggested the open cupboards over my washer and dryer. This worked wonderfully.  She never looked at my thoughts as ""no you can't do that"", but rather ""what if we did this"".  She helped get me the maximum amount of storage that I needed while staying within our budget. She was able to work my washer and dryer into the design of the kitchen as well."
5,"We hired S&W Kitchens to do a complete renovation of our laundry room.  From design, to demolition, to procurement, installation and completion, they did a fantastic job all around.  Chris Druschel (design coordinator) and Tim Hobson (construction superintendent) are creative, dedicated and skilled professionals who were a pleasure to work with from start to finish.  The project was completed on time and within budget as promised.  Tim and Chris kept us informed at every step of the process.  While we had high expectations going into the project, S&W far exceeded our expectations.  We could not give S&W as a whole and Chris Druschel and Tim Hobson in particular a higher recommendation.  We would not hesitate to recommend them to our friends and neighbors or to hire them for other projects in the future."
5,"Recently had a complete remodel of my '80s kitchen.  They did a great job designing the new space and all of the workmen were very professional.  The old space was gutted.  One window was removed  and the ceiling was raised to increase storage.  I now have more storage space than I have ""stuff'.  A very nice predicament.  I replaced ""everything"" in the kitchen except for 2 of the 3 existing windows.  I am very pleased with how everything turned out and the time line and cost was right on target."
5,"Bill is an exceptional designer.  He listens to your needs and offers very good suggestions.  He is detailed-oriented, which is really a plus when you know how you want to use a space but not how to make it happen.  Bill makes it happen!  This is the first part of a two-part home office project."
5,"We could not be happier with our experience with Finecraft renovating our kitchen and bath, as well as overseeing the installation for a new HVAC system.  Every craftsman was skillful, kind, and thoughtful of us as we maneuvered around them over the months of this project.  The attention to detail was impressive, and the hands-on approach of George (the owner) and Vivian (the project manager - and George's first cousin) always made us feel totally confident that we were getting our money's worth.  We recommend them without reservation.  Maryetta Andrews-Sachs and Bob Zeskind - 4920 45th St. NW"
5,"I had the pleasure of working with FineCraft Contractors on a full renovation and addition that I designed for a client in Northern Virginia.  George Papaheraklis and Vivian made a great team, paying close attention to details and quality workmanship. It is refreshing to work with a builder who has a collaborative approach and is 'hands on.' The client lived in the house during a large project and FineCraft worked hard to make that happen and ensure they were happy with the end result. I would highly recommend FineCraft as a top-notch builder to any of my clients and hope to work with them again!"
5,We really enjoyed working with FineCraft for our basement refresh. They were extremely responsive and took great care in making sure our project was done right and on time. They do a really nice job setting projects up with a team so you always know who your point person is for questions or concerns during the work. They also did a really nice job keeping us updated. We really appreciated that as issues came up (which they are always bound to do when renovating a 70 year old house) that our contractor was always ready with options as well as his best suggestion for how we could solve problems and make it work. We will definitely be returning to FineCraft for future projects and are really loving our new basement space!
5,"I’ve had the pleasure and privilege  to work of Fine craft Contractors  for a very long time. The first time  Owner and principal George Papaheraklis and I initially contracted with me was in 1987 almost 35 years ago! One can immediately ascertain that George has Architectural Training and an artistic eye merely by the way he could anticipate the next design move and and the way he can finesse meticulous details with visually graceful solutions. Our Attention to detail and the minutia are often a challenge for many general contractors but George leans into these challenges with a positive attitude and productive energy. One particular ecfample was the sculpture above the front door of our Midcentury addition and renovation.  Initially a flea market fragment, DLA's last minute detailing required stone and steel. This could have been vocalized with frustration but instead was met by George Papaheraklis with passion and has become the crowning jewel of the composition. A client once heard George saying under his breath that his quest for good construction is ""life sustaining"" for him. Since we first met decades ago, his close knit staff has  grown; in both size and professionality. One of our mutual projects was of particular challenge. However it was constructed methodically and intelligently along with  Vivian who is integral to FineCraft's efficiency, stream lined production and ""can do"" nature.  This was was no small task especially as two prjects they have worked with us on took place in the middle the pandemic. Dasha, Niko and Patrick who I have worked with personally  are all a part of the caliber FineCraft Contractors brings to the table and table saw!"
5,"We couldn't be more pleased with FineCraft! They flawlessly executed a complicated design to create a modern 'floating' porch on our 1930s center hall colonial house. All of their trades - including the mason, carpenter, electrician, painter, etc - worked together seamlessly and in lockstep to bring the project to life. We loved how George and Vivian were always coming by the house on a daily basis to answer any questions and make sure the quality was up to par. We always felt like we were up to speed on what was happening and where we were in the process. We would definitely choose FineCraft again for future projects and we are ecstatic about the work they did or us."
5,I have to say we are completely satisfied with the bathroom remodel. It met and exceeded expectations and was long overdue. I never had to question the teams expertise or competence which can't be said for every contractor in the DC area. We look forward to either working with your team again.
4,Great company--goes the extra mile.  Very dedicated professionals who do what is needed to make it right. Great to work with.
5,"FineCraft just completed a major, year-long remodel for us in Northern Virginia.  We are delighted with the quality materials, workmanship, and attention to detail.  We lived in the house during the work. You might question this choice, but with FineCraft, it worked.  We saw the same crews–not random contractors–every day.  To a man, they were friendly, courteous, and took pains to leave a clean living space at the end of every day.  George Papaheraklis was on site every few days, troubleshooting, improving, and explaining what was going to happen and in what order.  The house looks great and is easy to live in.  We got more than expected and at a fair price."
5,Consummate professionals! Easy to work with and would recommend these guys to anyone who wants a high quality and professional job!
5,They did my addition and were excellent. Shout out to Chris who was always so kind and professional and always available when needed!
5,"Finecraft prides itself on attention to detail, and indeed this was our experience throughout the renovation project (a kitchen and sunroom upgrade that opened interior space without modifying the exterior footprint of the house). To make our lives much easier, they built a separation wall between the work area and the rest of the living area and reconstructed a temporary kitchen on the main floor in the living area, so we were able to stay in the house during the construction. This made a big difference during the forced home-based work due to Covid pandemic. The staff left the place in good shape each day before leaving. At the end, they did not hesitate to come back several times and in a timely manner to complete the details remaining on the punch list. We love our new space."
4,"FineCraft has done two significant projects for us - a major terrace remake four years ago and now a total kitchen renovation.  We are very pleased with their workmanship and the ease of our working relationship.  On several occasions, they have taken extra steps to please us."
5,"We were converting a two story great room into a second floor with new bedrooms, as well as renovating our kitchen and a bathroom / laundry room.   With a baby on the way our timeline was tight - no room for delays - and Finecraft not only delivered but exceeded all expectations in terms of reliability, craftsmanship, and staying true to the estimate.   We were out of town for most of the project and were able to communicate effectively with the team via mobile app and/or Facetime.   Once we were back in the house, Rosendo and his team were very respectful and friendly (and kept everything clean!), and responsive to any and all questions or minor issues.   Would hire them again for any project.   Very pleased with the final result as well as the process.  Thank you!"
5,"Finecraft did an excellent job, our addition is beautiful and they were nice to work with.  We had a few hiccups along the way, but they were quick to fix."
5,We have had the pleasure of working with FineCraft on a handful of projects. They are attentive and responsive to both clients and fellow professionals. We look forward to future opportunities to collaborate with the crew at FineCraft.
5,"It has been a pleasure to work with the Finecraft team. They have great communication, responsive and their attention to detail is top notch! I am looking forward to future projects with Finecraft!!"
5,"Finecraft did a fantastic job on our renovation -- we highly recommend them. Thanks to all the staff, but especially to Rei for shepherding the project through on the site. We were consistently impressed by the level of craftsmanship and attention to detail that went into the project. We can't thank the team enough."
5,"We had a great experience with a Finecraft from start to finish. Their professionalism, attention to detail and flexibility were remarkable. Our project turned out even better than expected, at a very competitive price. We are delighted!"
5,"Once again it was a pleasure working with George Papaheraklis and the Finecraft team. This project was very sophisticated, involving creative building challenges which Finecraft easily met. George always adds both value and Grace.

5,It was a great team that worked diligently and cohesively to deliver a new beautifully detailed and elegant two-family home on Capitol Hill!
5,Fantastic experience! We just love the team at FineCraft Contractors. We have used them for two renovations at our house and will use them again. Their customer service and professionalism are outstanding. We absolutely love the finished project and would recommend them to any looking to do work on their home.
5,"We hired FineCraft to renovate the basement in our 1958 split-level home.  It was important to us for the project to create a more functional living space that was still traditional enough to match the rest of our home's interior.  They did a terrific job - followed the architect's plan to the letter.  The quality of the work was top-notch.  In fact, the WSSC inspector thought the work under his purview was the nicest he'd seen.  The members of the construction crew were polite and professional.  George has a fine aesthetic that clearly carries through to all of the work done by FineCraft. The workmen who laid the tile, particularly in the bathroom, are truly artisans.   It is a lovely space, and we could not be happier.  I'd recommend FineCraft to others who are considering a remodeling job."
5,"We have done the remodeling of a bedroom (with loft + stairs) and a bathroom.
We were very pleased with Finecraft and I would highly recommend them.
This is a team of high professional with a very friendly staff. Everybody in the team has some specific expertise and are managed by a project lead. Though, the company is not too big and you can feel that this is a family business company and that they care about project."
5,Working with Finecraft was a very rewarding experience for me. The company worked well with my architects and executed all aspects of the project in a professional manner. I look forward to working with them again!
5,Our screen porch has a wow factor.  Finecraft took the architect's plans and turned them into a gorgeous and functional room.  The craftsmanship and attention to detail is apparent in every aspect of the construction.  They stayed within the specified time and budget constraints.  It was a pleasure to work with all members of the Finecraft team.
5,"We went through a long process of selecting a contractor for a remodel of our home on Capitol Hill. We are so glad we chose the fine people at Finecraft. The moment we interacted with them, we knew that there was chemistry. It was a long project with many customized flourishes that were unique and challenging. The Finecraft team did an incredible job and delivered our dream house. Their professionalism, attention to detail and overall team work made for a stress free journey through the construction. If we had to do this again, we will do it in a heartbeat. 

Thank you to the entire Finecraft team - Specially Jose and Dasha."
4,Enjoyed working with this team. Very professional and worked hard to minimize disruption to our family during construction period. Quality of work was stellar and communication was excellent.
5,"This team of professionals has an amazing ability to see what it is you want to create.  I have worked with this team in the community many times and when it came to getting a bid on my personal project, I knew they would not disappoint us.  Finecraft came, was on time listened to our ideas and then really looked at what we had to work with and created a plan that would work in our family budget.  They also gave us plenty of referral projects to go look at and customers to talk to for references.  It's not like, here are 3 people, its years of happy customers.  Their attention to detail and craftsmanship on their projects was what sold us.  Quality and excellent follow up."
5,"Finecraft Contractors, Inc is an absolutely first-class organization. Their name suits the quality of their management, personnel, and workmanship very well. They are true professionals in every sense. During the course of our home elevator construction and installation project, my wife and I got to know the Finecraft management and craftsmen team very well. We have only the most complimentary things to say about their courtesy, creativity, flexibility, and project management and execution skills. We highly recommend Finecraft Contractors, Inc to anyone who is looking for a superior home remodeling contractor."
5,"Finecraft did a wonderful job on this project.  In particular, their craftsmanship, timeliness, and attention to detail were admirable.  We look forward to working with them on Phase II of the project."
5,"We have now worked with Finecraft on a number of remodeling projects in the DC area.  They are a highly professional and skilled Contractor that produces quality craftsmanship and on time project delivery.  As Architects, we have found Finecraft brings value added ideas to the project whether it be product recommendations or if an issue is discovered how to solve it. We would highly recommend Finecraft to our clients."
5,We hired Finecraft to build our screened-in porch on a recommendation from our architect and overall were very pleased with the project.  The quality of work was very good and their team was professional and courteous.  We would absolutely recommend them for similar projects.
5,"Finecraft Contractors is a top quality operation. I have done multiple renovation projects with George and his team, including bathrooms, kitchen, addition, terrace, and in-law apartment. Finecraft has a great sense of aesthetics, great attention to detail, and the construction site is left impeccably clean every night. That's why I am a return customer!"
5,"Finecraft contractors is a well rounded professional company in the DC area. 
Their crew is highly skilled and the staff has superb customer service. Every project we have seen has exceeded our expectations. It is hard to find a building company with such high attention to detail. Working with the Finecraft family makes your experience enjoyable and gratifying."
5,"I have worked on several projects with Finecraft. They are an excellent company to work with and have a pleasant and knowledgeable staff that will always make client communication, service and quality their to priority!"
5,Finecraft did an excellent job renovating our garage and converting it into a gym. They were prompt in their reply and finished the project in the time they quoted which is huge! The price was reasonable and the staff was very responsive throughout the whole process. I highly recommend them for any home renovating project and will be using them again in the future!
5,"I hired Finecraft to handle a gut renovation of an 1890s townhouse in downtown Washington, DC. The property was an absolute mess and had been abandoned for 20 years. Finecraft were able to retain the front facade while constructing a new modern home with what was left of the old bones of the home. It turned out beautifully and is true to the architect's design. It was delivered on time and mostly on budget. I would recommend them to any other property owner in similarly situated historical/renovation jobs."
5,"As an architect, I'm naturally very protective of my clients with regard to contractor selection.  With Finecraft, i know that my clients are in good hands with a professional, honest, and thorough contractor.  Their work speaks for itself in terms of quality craftsmanship, and they are a delight to working with.  Communication is one of the most important parts of client management, and Finecraft clearly excels in this department. I would strongly recommend Finecraft to all of my clients no matter what type of project we design."
5,"We could not have imagined a better renovation experience! Everyone at Finecraft was a pleasure to work with from the owner all the way to the project manager, employees, and subcontractors. All were extremely nice, friendly, attentive, and with tremendous attention to detail. You could always contact them with a question and they would get back to you very quickly to explain or help. 

They did a great job on the addition of a mudroom, expansion and creation of a new open floor plan kitchen/family room combo, moving of a bathroom, renovation of two other bathrooms, and replacing the entire outside, including roof, windows, siding, patio, walkway, and portico. 

They completely transformed our house into a brand new property and we could not thank them enough. They were exactly on budget and on time, with no delays even though we substantially expanded the scope of the project. They were able to change gears smoothly and efficiently as our ideas evolved through the course of the work. They worked around our busy lives with 3 small children and were able to create a fully functioning mini-kitchen to allow us to stay in the house during the work.  Highly recommend them for your renovation/addition needs."
5,Finecraft did an extension on my historic house and it really is beautiful! George kept me in the loop about how it was all going. The team were efficient and respectful of my property and the problem-solving on the best way to get it all done was excellent. I would highly recommend this company.
5,"As both architect and client, I was pleased with Finecraft Contractors. I found the crews to be hardworking and pleasant. With our project, George took a hands on approach from beginning to end, and collaborated well to help create what we envisioned for our home."
4,"Generally quite pleased with our experience with Finecraft.  We hired them to complete a three story, 900 sq ft addition (plus some renovations to the existing space) in our NW DC home originally built in 1932.  They worked well with our architect, and showed consideration and willingness to work with us throughout the process, and were responsive to the minor concerns of our neighbors.  We were able to stay in our home throughout the project, which was completed (though punchlist) in less than 6 months.

In particular we found the quality of their carpentry (everything from floors, decking, exterior, closet work, trim) and paint to be outstanding.  We were very impressed, and received lots of compliments from friends and family.

Two areas I'd suggest clients keep in mind; first, as with almost all contractors, their approach to project management isn't to the same standard as with full service design-build firms.  You'll want to be proactive on communication about timelines, and confirm everything in writing (either emails or text.)  They are great at honoring commitments, but sometimes memories aren't perfect, and it's helpful to have a record.

The second area, related to above, was with the electrical work.  We did change things up a bit, but even with that, I wasn't super happy with the electrician.  Some of the work could have been done to a higher quality, and we had to tussle a bit him to get what we wanted; in a couple of cases the project wasn't done exactly as we wanted.  That could have been prevented if we did a better job documenting and holding them to what we discussed.

That all said I'd definitely recommend them.  Friendly and flexible, quality workmanship, and great price."
5,"We hired Finecraft to repair our master bathroom after the discovery of a leak and mold.  The Finecraft team was very professional and a pleasure to work with.  They listened to our concerns as well as our ideas and came up with recommendations that fit with the design.  They have a great network of suppliers and we were able to find great deals on tiles, fixtures and granite."
5,"After a year of discussions with our architect and Finecraft over the renovation of our 1920s colonial, we decided to go from a one story addition to a three story addition. George patiently addressed numerable questions raised by my detail -oriented husband. We lived in the house during the eight months of renovation, which enabled us to closely examine the outstanding craftsmen at work. George regularly came up with creative solutions to maximize the functionality of the space within our budget. When my husband and I disagreed about anything, we could always rely on George's professional vision and diplomatic resolution.   My serotonin levels would rise each day when I saw George and Vivien arrive in the red pickup; they inspire confidence.The Finecraft team is committed to excellent craftsmanship in a timely manner. We enjoyed working with them immensely and would love to do another project with them soon."
5,"Finecraft Contractors is by far, the most professional, caring, competent company we have used to work on our home. They completely restyled our 1940's Cape Cod 1st floor, as well as completed other outside improvements with magnificent results. From start to finish we always knew what was going on with our project. All of the folks on the project were absolutely the best - and they all stayed on the job until it was finished. As with older homes there are usually surprises when making changes to the floor plan. Our team anticipated those possibilities and problem-solved with us to accommodate our wishes. We felt that Finecraft truly cared about us, our needs, and our home and we could not be more pleased. We truly feel part of the Finecraft family!"
5,"Tess Moran and Cabinet Discounters have worked with Finecraft Contractors on many projects.  Finecraft can always be counted on for beautiful craftsmanship, excellent project management and top notch customer service."
5,"Fisher Lumber has been working together with Finecraft Contractors for four decades, They perform first class, detailed workmanship. If quality is what you want in your home improvements...look no further"
5,"I am an architectural designer based in LA, and my parents live in Rockville, MD.  Though they were in need of some basic home maintenance repairs as well as a kitchen renovation, they were completely intimidated by the construction process and didn't know where to begin.  Finecraft was recommended to me by a reputable architecture firm in Maryland, and it was a very smooth process to get everything completed on time and on budget once they were provided with a scope of work and design, even from across the country.  My parents are now thoroughly enjoying their kitchen makeover and new, non leaking windows."
5,"We were the architects for a complete 2nd floor remodeling job in Rockville. The project included the complete reconfiguration of the master bathroom and bedroom as well as moving the laundry closet into a new laundry room. We recommended Finecraft to our clients when they asked us about a trusted contractor. Often times it is risky for an architect to recommend a certain contractor but with Finecraft we have no hesitation. I know they will be professional, honest and if selected do a good job that is in line with the design intent.
I highly recommend them for your home remodeling projects."
5,Professional company with a very personal touch.  High quality work- You truly get what you pay for!  I feel confident every time I refer them to friends or clients.  They earn & keep the love & trust from their clients because they are passionate about what they do.  Can't say enough wonderful things about this company & leadership!
5,"We hired Finecraft to perform a remodeling of our townhome third floor. It was a significant undertaking as every room was impacted by the remodeling, which involved the renovation of the master bathroom, second bathroom, creation of a laundry room, expansion of closet space in the 3 bedrooms, creation of 2 linen closets, and renovation of the half bathroom on the main floor. Finecraft was recommended by the architect who designed the plans of the remodeling, as he pointed out the quality of the work performed. We ended up hiring Finecraft because they were interested by the project and they wanted to work with us. In comparison with other general contractors we interviewed, their pricing was very competitive. Overall, the project lasted 2 months. Our family of 4 lived in the house while under renovation, the workers were very accommodating and respectful of the circumstances, and most importantly very clean in consideration of the work performed. What we are the most pleased with is the quality of the work and the details in the finishes. They fully enable the vision we had for this remodeling. Even though we wish that there was more clarity on the agreement, better communication with certain change orders, and more flexibility with the allowances, we are very pleased to have chosen Finecraft. The functionality of our new layout and the beautiful bathrooms are now permanent features of our new home, working with Finecraft worth every single penny. We also referred Finecraft to friends who have subsequently hired them for their project needs."
5,"Top notch service!

After meeting with over a dozen contractors, we found Finecraft to be the perfect fit for our renovation.  They performed the work within the timeline specified and ensured we didn't exceed our budget.  The crews showed up Mon-Fri at the same time and progress was made each and everyday.  Although we (the customer) made a number of mistakes, Finecraft was patient and understanding, ensuring we were satisfied every step of the way.

Overall, we would recommend anyone use Finecraft for their future renovation needs.  I never wouldn't of imagined I would ever be so happy with a contractor's performance, but here I am, writing this review.  If your a stickler for exceptionally high quality work without having to pay ridiculous prices, go with Finecraft, it will be worth the wait considering their high demand."
5,"We have been working with Finecraft Contractors for a while now and have had a great experience - we are stone fabricators and they send us their clients to choose their countertops. They are professional and helpful to ensure their clients needs are met - whenever we need specific information about about a job, they always make sure everything is correct and we are on the same page on every project. As a sales representative, I know how important it is to communicate with the client - especially if there is a contractor involved. 
We definitely recommend  Finecraft for your house renovation and look forward to working with them for future projects."
5,Finecraft is just terrific. Their staff is friendly; their work is meticulous and the did our project on-time and within budget.
5,I have had the pleasure to work with Finecraft on several projects. They are a family owned and operated business who takes pride in their work as well as delivering a remarkable experience to their clients.
5,"Finecraft is an unusual combination of exceptional talent, fine craftsmanship, delivering more than expected and with personal touches that would make any home remodeling or home construction project a dream for the owner.  On time, on the ball, on target and on top of the project from start to finish.  It's been a pleasure to attend the open houses to discover the range of services and beautiful outcomes."
5,"Mario worked on two separate projects at my home.  One was an outdoor window that needed to be rebuilt the other removing an old bar area and replacing it with a closet.  Mario was efficient, polite, fairly priced and provided outstanding workmanship.  I'm using him again this month for yet another project.  I highly recommend him!"
5,"I am an Interior Designer and I had the pleasure of working with Finecraft Contractors, Inc. because my client was doing a major renovation, and Finecraft was doing the remodel. 
My experience in working with them was professional, cordial and efficient.  It seemed that our mutual goal was to make sure that our client  got what they wanted to their utmost satisfaction!
I treat every client like I would want to be treated...................and that's what I saw in Finecraft Contractors, Inc. as well!  Keep up the professionalism and quality of your work!!!"
5,"I have found Finecraft to be a very professional company, who focuses on customer satisfaction and delivering a superb product above all. From first contact to finishing the project, Finecraft is friendly, professional, and genuinely cares. The project turned out beautiful and better than I expected!!"
5,"We hired Finecraft for three projects that included remodeling our kids bathroom from a single user to multi user setup, refinishing our basement, and creating a built-in bookcase/fireplace/TV wall for the master bedroom.  All 3 projects turned out great.  The team working on the projects where there every day, and they staffed resources accordingly - so some days it was 2 guys, and other days there was up to 5 guys depending on what needed to be accomplished.  All projects where completed within the time estimate, and on the agreed upon prices.  Their construction staff all wore corporate tee-shirts, and where professional and careful of cleanliness and the surrounding spaces.  While I think it is hard to determine a low cost provider for these types of services, value is more important.  And Finecraft delivered that, as well as adding a designer to take our project visions into reality.  We have more work to do, and will hire them again."
5,"We hired Finecraft to renovate our late-1890s row house in DC, including putting in a new kitchen.  We were very pleased with the work done by Finecraft.  George and his team were able to create a kitchen that has all of today’s modern amenities but still has the charm and finishes consistent with the age of the house.  The craftsmanship of the cabinetry and molding is beautiful.  They created plaster molding in the kitchen that matches the original molding perfectly.  Beyond the kitchen, the Finecraft team carefully restored the walls, molding and floors back to their original glory and updated our powder room and foyer tile.  The work was done timely and within budget.  And, the Finecraft team was responsive to our questions and requests.  We would recommend them without reservation for any type of renovation – from new build to restoring an older home."
5,George and his crew are complete professionals with and eye for details. The additions to our house by Finecraft are high quality and very well constructed. I highly recommend them for any project.
5,"We were set to hire another contractor when we met George Papaheriklis of Finecraft Contractors, Inc. Not having any experience remodeling or hiring contractors and after hearing some of our friends’ experiences we were very weary and nervous about the whole process. George’s openness, demeanor and patience answering all of our questions and concerns put us at ease in no time. Needless to say, after just a few minutes we knew we have found our contractor. The experience overall was great and the end result fantastic. It was not without its ups and downs, but during the process George and the Finecarft’s crew were very patient, diligent and most of all professional. They addressed all of our requests and made sure we were completely satisfied with the end work; not an easy feat when dealing with a self-professed perfectionist. An inch to the left or to the right was not an issue; they worked very hard to make us happy. George was very hands-on throughout our project and was available anytime there was a question or concern. He was very candid and willing to explain things to us both regarding the scope of work and the costs involved, especially on those pesky change orders (our own requests). Because of his background in architecture, George offered suggestions and made changes that made things just right, going so far as to doing things just because they will look better, no change orders. We were living in the house while the renovation/addition was going on. Finecraft not only provided us with a temporary kitchen, complete with a sink and running water, while they did the work, but they were very accommodating to our needs and timing, made sure everything was clean at the end of the day and took every possible precaution to avoid dust and debris coming into our living space. Many friends have commented on the craftsmanship and quality of the work. Most of all, Finecraft stands behind their work, they have been prompt and thorough in addressing all those little and no so little things that sometimes pop up on new construction; nothing has been too big or too small for them to come and fix. In the end, what matters most is that George and the Finecraft’s crew has our gratitude, respect and above all, trust."
4,"We contacted Finecraft for a smaller project in the summer of 2016 based on the Houzz reviews. They contacted us back very quickly, but because we had a tight deadline, Finecraft were not able to do the project themselves, but recommended one of their sub-contractors called American Trademark. AT renovated a small master bath for us on a very short deadline and completed the project in just over 2 weeks. The process went smoothly and we got the bathroom we wanted. They cleaned up at the end of each day and kept the mess to a minimum. The team was professional and met the deadline and stayed within budget. After completion, we noticed that some paint in the stairway to our second floor had been ripped off probably when they removed the paper that had protected the stairs. Not a big job to have fixed, but the reason what I did not give the full 5 stars."
5,"We hired Finecraft Contractors, Inc. for a third floor addition to our row house in Washington DC.  We would highly recommend Finecraft as a contractor.  We were very happy with their work.  In addition, they were responsive, answered our questions and concerns promptly, and went above and beyond to make sure the project was completed to our satisfaction (including the completion a number of added change orders along the way and completing punchlist items)."
5,"We contacted Finecraft because one of my coworkers had used them for 2-3 projects and recommended their work.  Niko and Chris came to the house and looked over the kitchen.  They immediately made some useful suggestions about the design for our new kitchen.  Niko put us in contact with a first rate designer.  We visited Appliance Distributors Unlimited (ADU) after seeing the listing on the Finecraft website.  We worked with the designer and a representative from ADU through several iterations of design, cabinet selection and appliance selection until we had a design and set of appliances that we liked and that fit within our budget.  The good folks at Finecraft got to work on Tuesday July 5th and finished on Friday July 15th.  They had told us it would take about two weeks, meaning 10 business days, and it took 9   Most of the work on the kitchen was done by one worker, Moses, and his assistant.  The work was extremely well done.  Moses is a true craftsman.  He is meticulous and he knows what he is doing.  There were several points along the way at which we had to make decisions about routing wires, the vent for the hood and other things.  We were given the opportunity to participate in the decision making where it was appropriate to do so.  All in all, we are very satisfied with the final product.  I would be very happy to have Finecraft do other projects, such as our master bathroom, especially if Moses or someone else with similar skill is involved."
5,"After interviewing several other local contractors, I hired Finecraft to relocate our master bathroom to the window line to permit natural light in the bathroom.  We also created a master dressing room (closet).  I was so impressed with their work that I expanded on the assignment to include several other projects.  I truly enjoyed working with George.  He is delightful to work with.  George comes up with excellent/creative ideas to solve issues, while being sensitive to cost restrictions.  George was personally very involved in our project from start to finish and he went over and beyond many times.  The construction workers who were in our home were very respectful of our home and cleaned up every day.  They were very accommodating and did an excellent job.  FineCraft cared very much about our project and ensured that we were satisfied.  I am very pleased with the project and FineCraft and highly recommend them."
5,"We recently completed a magnificent kitchen and renovation project with Finecraft and we could not be happier. George and his team brought their fine workmanship and attention to detail that made all the difference in producing a finished product that exceeded our expectations. George was very hands-on throughout our project and made himself available anytime there was a question or concern.  Because of his extensive background in architecture, George worked well with our architect and other vendors we used to complete our project. The entire Finecraft team was extremely professional, responsive and truly a pleasure to work with.  I would not hesitate to recommend Finecraft to any homeowner interested in doing a renovation or building a brand new home."
5,"Finecraft did a fantastic job on remodeling my bedroom and bathroom. The work crew was tremendous -- talented, courteous, professional, on time. The design staff was very helpful in helping me with decisions on color, selection of materials and decor. They were very accommodating and a pleasure to collaborate with."
5,"We have worked with Finecraft Contractors, Inc. in several projects now and it we must say their work is 5-star. In addition to their quality and superb customer service, they are a joy to work with. It's rare to see first hand a construction company that stands behind their word and delivers with such abundance. The Finecraft team truly cares for they clients and goes the extra mile to make sure they are happy and satisfied with the project. Looking forward to more projects with them."
5,"My wife and I downsized to a condo. The location of our new condo  was exactly what we wanted but the interior of the condo was not. We decided to gut our 2,000 sq.ft. condo and  construct a very  modernly designed one. After much searching,  we and our designer chose Finecraft as the builders. We presented  precise plans, which had a number of unusual features.  Finecraft did excellent work: details of the construction were carefully attended to; they arranged for material to be brought from Portugal, Japan and elsewhere; they were flexible in accommodating some changes we made as the construction went along. The configuration of our glasswork was unusual in shape and size, but  the work of Finecraft in managing to actually bring the glass into the condo and install it  was truly impressive. 

The cost of the project was what we had agreed to. The project took a little longer than expected. But this was because of the severe limitations our condo association placed on the times when work could be done  and the convoluted  rules and unpredictable inspection scheduling  imposed by the Fairfax County building inspection bureaucracy.

Finally,  the President of Finecraft, George Papaheraklis,  kept a keen eye on the project's progress, as frequently present  and responded quickly to any questions we had.   We highly recommend Finecraft."
5,"Finecraft did great work for us, and when we had issues arrive, they were quick to rectify them. We are very appreciative of there attentiveness."
5,We recently had two bathrooms updated by Finecraft in our 1930s Glover Park house and could not be happier with the process and results! From the beginning Niko and his team excelled at communication - whether it was Niko checking in to make sure the work had begun on time or Chris (our project manager) letting us know what work would be done. We were impressed with how hard their team worked to make sure the project was complete before our planned move-in date. Every time we went to the house to check on the progress the team was working incredibly hard and were happy to show us what had been completed that day. We are already planning to use Finecraft again for future projects!
5,"In February 2016, Finecraft renovated our family room.  The owner sketched a preliminary drawing based on our desire for light and warmth, and provided a ballpark cost estimate.  We discussed the options and details, and finalized the plan and cost estimate with the caveat that we could be flexible with the artistic plan and the cost if and as needed. The big decisions were made prior to beginning the work.  We were guided to a door company to select a door and a stone company to pick out surround and hearth stone. To make a more expansive family room with plenty of light, they knocked down a wall; installed a window that matched the other two windows already in the room; built bookcases with storage cabinets; a window seat with drawers, and a closet; installed a wood floor and ceiling lights; updated the fireplace from a brick to stone façade with an inset for a flat panel television; and replaced a sliding glass door with a double French door.  The crew arrived on time each day, completed the work assignments, and cleaned up at day’s end. The crew was friendly, professional, and not intrusive. In fact, they were so trustworthy that we provided access to a key for flexibility such that we were not dependent on their work schedule.  We were contacted at the end of each day with a summary of what was done, what would be done next, and what we, as the homeowners, needed to decide or go pick out in the week ahead, e.g., paint color, cabinet door knobs.  The crew even moved large furniture in and out of the work space so we did not have to do so. Overall, our experience with Finecraft was extremely positive. The work was done within schedule and budget. We have worked with Finecraft on previous renovations, large and small, and will do so again.
The crew at Finecraft are true professionals, well trained, and skilled such that they act independently and do not require direct supervision."
5,I had the opportunity to work with George and his crew on a number of different home renovations ranging from small remodels to full bottom to top demolition through renovation.  In all instances I found the crews to be pleasant and hardworking and fully in alignment with George's vision for the final product.  George takes a very hands on approach to all his projects from the beginning to the end and works very well with his clients to create exactly what they envision for their new home.
5,I have worked with Finecraft in three different projects and I find them very professional and detail oriented. I am a designer with many years of experience and worked with a lot of different contractors. Gisela Interiors
5,"I contacted Finecraft from California after seeing a picture of a bathroom that I loved on Houzz, they answered the phone when I called and emailed me all the information I needed within 24 hours.  They really were wonderful.  Much appreciated for helping out!!  5 Stars for awesome customer service!!"
5,"After interviewing and getting bids and references from 10 different recommended contractors, we hired Finecraft Contractors to excavate and gut renovate our basement and they did an exceptional job.  They worked with us to make my vision come alive, and their attention to detail and workmanship exceeded my very high expectations.  The Finecraft team was reliable, respectful, and responsive, and they finished ahead of schedule and on budget.  I would 100% recommend them."
5,"We had Finecraft remodel our kitchen and family room from July 13 - October 13, 2015. Every aspect of the renovation was a positive experience. They said it would take three months, and they were done basically three months to the date they started. The quality of work was superb and it was easy to get in touch with either the owner or foreman throughout the entire project. We will definitely use Finecraft again!"
5,"Finecraft Contractors are the best.  Their workmanship is top-notch and their workers are all experts in the respective fields.  They are a fantastic crew.  We are pleased with our additions and changes which will enable us to stay in our house as we become less mobile. We now have a beautiful custom-made roll-in shower and other bathroom changes that enable a person in a wheelchair to use the bathroom. This was a tricky undertaking because of the configuration we wanted. Most importantly, the owner, George Papaheriklis, listened to us and made sure that the construction was perfect,  He consulted with us all during the construction."
5,"Fine craft Contractors lives up to their name, Fine Craft!   Their leadership and crew were 100% and superseded all expectations.   I highly recommend hiring Fine Craft if you want true quality work, professionals who are passionate, honest and efficient.  A true headache free experience.   

Thank you Fine Craft for everything you have done for me and my family!  
Michael"
5,"I am an Architect and worked with Fine Craft for a complete home redesign/renovation project. I happy to say that the project was a success. Fine Craft Contractors are very professional, detail oriented and incredibly responsive. They exceeded my expectations and would recommend their services to my clients for their future construction projects. They follow the design through, completed the project on time and exactly as it was planned."
5,"I am an architect and worked with FineCraft on a kitchen/ family room renovation.  Their
work is excellent and high quality with attention to detail.  The project was finished within the timeline projected.  I enjoyed working with George Papaheraklis, as he is a master builder with many years of experience, has a good eye, and brings great ideas to the project.  My clients also enjoyed working with George and were very excited about the end product.  I highly recommend this company and look forward to working with them again!"
5,"We recently completed a large remodeling project in partnership with Finecraft Contractors, Inc.  The project encompassed a large, high end Kitchen and two baths, including the Master Bath.  George Papaheraklis and his fine crew are a pleasure to work with and have a keen attention to detail.  No request was too small and every team member was respectful and professional.  The end product turned out exactly as we had designed it, plus George made some wonderful suggestions along the way which were executed in the overall project.  I would not hesitate to recommend Finecraft to my design colleagues or homeowners looking for a quality project!  George is highly professional, easy to work with and his team is dedicated to their craft and always strive to achieve the highest level of client satisfaction."
5,"I have used Finecraft Contractors, Inc. on several occasions and I highly recommend using them on your next project.  Finecraft does very high end work with prices that are reasonable compared to the industry.  The management team, their organization of projects, keeping customers informed, happy and satisfied before during and after the project is complete is the best.  I will definitely continue to use them and will refer them to anyone in need of a good contractor."
5,Great Contractor to work with.  Very professional and worked well coordinating scheduling for a smooth installation.   High quality work and attention to detail.
5,"Finecraft recently renovated our kitchen.  Not only did they provide us with a temporary kitchen, complete with a sink and running water, while they did the work, but they were timely, professional and skilled in all they did.  Their attention to detail elevated the project.  Our kitchen has been transformed.  We are extremely impressed by their efforts."
5,"I hired Finecraft to build out a previously unfinished basement, reconstruct a front porch and a side porch and replace all of the shutters on our house's façade.  Finecraft did a tremendous job.  The workers were professional, worked quickly but with high quality and there was always great communication so I knew what activities were going to occur and when.  We actually had an unforeseen waterproofing issue with our foundation which Finecraft addressed quickly, provided an effective solution and executed the fix at a very reasonable cost.  It was a pleasure to work with Finecraft and I cannot recommend them more highly."
5,"Finecraft Contractors, Inc.

We completed a kitchen/family room renovation for our 40 year old home.  We met with  three contractors and received three quotes.  From design support to workmanship and quality, we were pleased with every aspect of our experience with Finecraft.   After  seeing a Finecraft renovation in the neighborhood, we were sold.  

The entire team was professional, clean and respectful of our home.  It is never easy to live through a kitchen renovation but George and Niko went out of their way to make the process easy for our family.  Without question we would recommend FineCraft to friends and family."
5,"Finecraft was recommended by our architect for a major renovation to our house (expanded and remodeled kitchen, family room and master bedroom ans master bathroom, as well as some other updates).

The workmanship and attention to detail was outstanding.  Finecraft was very responsive throughout the project, they provided good ideas and suggestions, they cleaned up very thoroughly throughout theproject.  The project manager was excellent and they clearly take great pride in their work.

We had done another major renovation several years earlier in a former house and we wish that Finecraft had done that one as well, because there was no comparison in the quality and management of our earlier project with the one that Finecraft managed.

I highly recommend Finecraft for any home renovation or construction project."
5,"We are first time home buyers and have never dealt with home renovations. Our house was in decent condition at purchase but needed a serious facelift throughout - we hired Finecraft to renovate the majority of the house, which meant new bathrooms, kitchen, new drywall pretty much everywhere, electrical, etc etc. They did an excellent job guiding us through the process (their site manager was particularly good, always calm, easy to talk to). They handled hiccups in the schedule and work plan very well, and had really good suggestions for improvements throughout the house (removing parts of walls, design ideas for custom cabinetry). Overall, excellent experience, and we are thrilled with the results. Highly recommend."
5,"Late 2014 through spring 2015, FineCraft undertook a major reconstruction of our backyard terrace, plus improvements to the inside of our house.  Outside work included: new retaining walls with extensive foundation improvements, extensive drainage improvements, blue stone paving, tree pits, trellis and wood slat fencing, new lighting, redirected and reinforced stairways, and removal of sunroom parapets.  Inside work included: two skylights, two new windows that required breaking through the existing structures, installing lighting fixtures and ceiling fan, and completion of requested small tasks.
 
Being a project limited to a small area, detail design and execution were critical.  We employed The Kurylas Studio as project architects.  Kurylas Studios recommended FineCraft as one of several contractors.  FineCraft’s expertise with architecture and attention to detail proved critical to the project success.  As a real team effort, FineCraft working with the architect and us, made several valuable design alterations.   They rebuilt one retaining wall rather than repair it and for a second retaining wall, they used traditional brick facing rather than ¼ inch brick facing.  Both company owners and the project foreman were professional, respectful, knowledgeable and easy to work with.  When we disagreed, their professionalism always led to quick resolutions, which all parties felt good about.  Impressive to us was how fair FineCraft priced change orders.  Not only are we satisfied, the whole team is proud how the project turned out."
5,"We hired Finecraft a few years back when we were planning a major renovation to our home. We had completed a similar renovation in the past on a previous home and the difference between our first experience and this one was like night and day. From the very beginning, George, his foreman and the crew were professional, responsive, worked quickly and efficiently and got the project done in the time estimated. We lived in our home during the renovation and the Finecraft crew showed up on time EVERY time, did the work each day and cleaned up!! after each days work. We had the same foreman for the complete project and he reflected George's and Finecraft's values of professionalism, attention to detail and pride in craftsmanship. During the process, George would review the upcoming work and make sure that all the details were taken care of. Their workmanship was superb, the fine details that speak to master carpentry and pride in workmanship are evident throughout the project. We have lived in our home for 10 years since that work was done and it still looks as good today as it did when it was newly finished. We recently needed some repair and remodeling done to another part of our home and we didn't even need to go out to bid - we just hired Finecraft again. You will not be sorry you chose them!"
5,"Finecraft Contractors, Inc. is an excellent company! The staff are very professional and efficient. I was so impressed by their work. The quality and design of their projects are some of the best I've seen in this industry. I would gladly work with them again!"
5,"This was my first experience working with George of Finecraft, He is a professional who listens, asks intelligent questions, and proposes great solutions based on his years of experience in the industry. The quality of Finecraft's work is high, and the staff is friendly and responsive. I strongly recommend George and the Finecraft team."
5,"Finecraft built an addition and new outbuilding, designed by my firm, for one of the more finely-detailed late-19th century homes in the town of Kensington's historic district. The owners chose Finecraft because they wanted to match the quality of detail and workmanship that had sold them on the house in the first place. The end result did not disappoint. Finecraft performed at a high level of professionalism and the quality of their workmanship was superb."
5,"Finecraft has been in the area for 30+ years now and has demonstrated time and time again that their company stands for quality. I can say this because I've seen their work firsthand and I've followed them for many years now. I simply love their work and their quality. They stand by what they build no matter what. It goes without saying they really care for the houses they build and for the homeowners they collaborate with. 

As a homeowner, it's important for me to know that I can rely on the contractor I hire. I can say without a doubt that I can rely on Finecraft to follow through and produce a quality product without concern or hassle. Once you find this type of relationship you never want to let it go. 

Having a good contractor is one thing. Having a great contractor that you can work well with, that has good communication skills, coordinates well and who you can build a fine working relationship with is quite another experience. 

It goes without saying I'd recommend them without a doubt.

5,"I am very impressed by the spectacular new home Finecraft has constructed on Durbin Road in Bethesda.  The exterior & interior exhibit an exquisite & spacious design, & it is a welcome addition to our evolving older neighborhood."
5,"Claude C. Lapp Architects has recently had the pleasure of collaborating with Finecraft Contractors, Inc. on a renovation and large addition. The experience has been outstanding. George & Niko possess wonderful communication skills that guide projects along without a hitch. Their knowledge and passion for the industry are ever-present through every phase of construction. 

Over the years, we have been lucky to have worked with many of the area’s finest builders and contractors. Finecraft ranks among the top from our perspective. We look forward to working with them in the future."
5,"As a 25 year old Company, a window supplier such as ourselves have worked with thousands of remodelors locally. Finecraft Contractors have stood the test of time having more than a 20 year relationship with our company. This clearly speaks to the way they handle themselves professionally & work closely with their clients. The level of quality that they deliver every time ensures their future. Great companies such as this stay strong and busy making their Clients dreams become reality. We look forward for another 20 years & more."
5,"The details and craftsmanship in the work by Finecraft Contractors is exquisite. Being an Architectural Photographer, I see a lot of houses on a daily basis. I'm very impressed with the close attention to detail and the quality of the work that Finecraft has put into this beautiful house. It's truly a work of art and I'm excited to photograph more of their work."
5,"This project involved the complete renovation of the second and third (attic) floors of the back wing of our historic home, to create a master bedroom suite (with full bath and 2 walk-in closets), laundry area and linen closet on the second floor, and two bedrooms and a full bath on the attic floor.  It involved creating 2 new dormers and a new gable on the attic floor and installation of new windows.  Considerable upgrading of joists and rafters to meet modern codes was required in this historic home.  Great care was taken to ensure that all changes were consistent with the historic nature of this home, including custom-milled moldings and use of antique recovered heart pine flooring, among others.
Finecraft did an outstanding job on this project, as they have in previous experience with them on other projects on this property.  They took exceptional care to get the details of the finishing right.  The same experienced workers were present for the entire project.  They listened careful to any questions or concerns we had, and consulted frequently with us as the job progressed.  They were highly professional at all times, and it was a pleasure to have them in our house (we remained resident in the rest of the house throughout the renovation).  Their proposed cost for the project was reasonable, and the job came in at the agreed price, and we agreed to some minor change orders as the work progressed.  The project took about 6 months for completion, which was somewhat longer than anticipated but not unreasonable given the structural work involved.
Overall, I have the highest recommendation for Finecraft for their professionalism and the quality of their work, from their initial comments on the design and detailing through demolition, construction and finishing, to the final clean-up.  It was a pleasure to work with them and I recommend them unconditionally."
5,"They are my favorite! They always seem to make things right. Even when things are tough they work through them and the outcome is always amazing. They have worked on several projects in my house and all of which are excellent products which reflect the level of detailed work that epitomizes Finecraft. From smaller projects to larger ones, from my experience, I can guarantee they'll leave you satisfied with the job you contract them for, hands down!"
5,"Finecraft says it all! What an amazing company. Their detail to workmanship, customer service and setting the standards for quality standards all across the board is what they are all about. George the owner of the company sets the standards for perfection in all the building and project management and Niko sets the standards for customer service and high end marketing using the latest technical tools to stay up with the newest building trends. Their team members hold to all these standards which make it one of the best remodeling companies in the area. I would highly recommend Finecraft to anyone looking for a company to take care of all their building needs and to any architect or design firm that would like to collaborate with their services. You can't go wrong in working with this company.

5,"Finecraft provided on site inspection of 11 wooden window frames, including a bay window in the front and on the side of our townhouse.  They identified the areas with water damage, developed a scope of work, and provided an estimate for replacing the damaged wood with a PVC product.  Their estimate was far and away better than those provided by the other two contractors.  They then proceeded to compete the scope of work over a four-day period.

We were impressed from the beginning with the professionlism, customer relations, and communication with Finecraft.   Niko, their office manager/supervisor was very communicative, as was Mario the primary carpenter/repairman.  Mario and his co-worker, Henry, did a great job on all of the windows, some of which required a complex scaffold set-up.  The results were excellent.  We can now be assured of the integrity of those 11 window frames.

I will use Fincraft again and recommend them to others.  They did excellent work for us."
5,"Finecraft has done numerous projects in my house, including the installation of hardwood floors, staircases, bathroom renovations and the installation of French doors. Their work was impeccable, their estimates to the point and their timing on target. One of the few companies that both the owners and the workers have integrity on their business transactions, put the customer above everything else and perform the work seamlessly, even when there are problems.
They recently completed a deck Gazebo that the the jewel of my deck and house. As in the other projects, their work was impeccable, on time and professional."
5,"Finecraft recently renovated our basement family room, bathroom, and bedroom.  They transformed a boring, dark, subterranean basement into a beautiful light-filled, walk-out family room.  In addition to renovating the bathroom and upgrading the bedroom, they also created a project room.  The results are stunning.  Their organization and attention to detail resulted in a large scale project that moved smoothly, despite involving the skill of several tradesmen, all of whom are on staff with Finecraft (no subcontracting challenges).  We could not be happier with the results!"
5,"I have had the pleasure of working with the professionals of Finecraft Contractors, Inc for several years now. I have seen many of their stellar products in working with them. I believe the staff of Finecraft work very hard to ensure that the high quality of service they deliver is really conveyed by their marketing so that their prospective client knows what they have to offer. It is the quality in their service and in their projects which is stressed from the project manager to their marketing director and it shows."
4,They are very good with their job but expensive. They have great staff too! Be sure to specify anything you want for them if not you wont get it e.g if you want a bathroom be specific with every single detail you want in the bathroom down to the smallest detail like soap holder if not you wont get it. If you have the money and you desire a good job done call Finecraft!
4,"Great work, with nice attention to detail.  The workers were tidy, thorough, and professional.  Lovely design, over and above architect's rendering."
4,"Since the early 1990's, I, an architect, have teamed up with and worked on many fine residential projects all around the Washington, DC, metropolitan area, including my own house.  George Papahericles, the owner, brings great passion, honesty and energy to each of his well crafted projects."
5,"I've been following Finecraft Contractors, Inc. online for several years now and the work that I have seen is just absolutely outstanding. I so wish I could have them come down to Florida to work on my future home. The quality of the work is just top-notch and if you are looking for the best product and service, I'd highly recommend Finecraft! I've had the honor of meeting several their employees and they're such a pleasure to be around and they are very hard-working, reliable people. Like I said, I would hire them in a heartbeat."
5,"Finecraft Contractors recently completed the construction of my design for a garage with guest suite above.  The project was small but George Papaheraklis and his team gave it their full respect and attention. They were knowledgeable, detail oriented, and a pleasure to work with; I look forward to our next project together.

5,Finecraft has done some of the best quality jobs I´ve seen.  The company is composed of truly valuable people who deliver a fantastic product and a good experience.
5,Finecraft Contractors successfully completed 2 remodeling projects for me this year.  Total window replacement and renovation of 2 bathrooms. They completed the work on time and I was very satisfied with the outcome.  I would recommend them highly to any potential customer.
5,"We have collaborated with Finecraft on several projects and have been impressed with their integrity, client commitment, as well as the overall quality of their work.  Each of these projects were medium sized renovations with very complex design details.  George and his team always try hard to please the client.  We look forward to working with them again on future projects!"
5,"Finecraft does excellent work!  Extreme attention to detail
George has a very good eye and is very accommodating.
His crew have been with him for a long time.  That
iIs very important to me as an Interior Designer.  A 
Company is only as good as the people who 
work for them.  I highly recommend Finecraft Contractors."
5,"My first experience with Finecraft Contractors was when my clients selected George Papaheraklis and his team to complete the construction of a large renovation we designed in Chevy Chase.  From the meetings prior to the start of construction it was evident that George and his team have a high attention to detail.   

Having Finecraft’s experience to work through changes and modifications in the field made the process a lot easier for the client and myself.  I was continuously amazed with the depth of skills within Finecraft and their ability to self-perform a lot of the work in this whole house transformation.  I look forward to working with them on future projects."
5,"Finecraft built an addition on our home in 2006 and we asked them to renovate our kitchen which was just completed and is beautiful.  They are exceptionally focused on detail ... we had a need to adjust the design of the project mid-stream and they undertook the change without   complaint and at no extra charge.  They are easy to work with, reliable and courteous.  You just have to get used to the hammers going at 7:30am because they work a long hard day."
5,"House build in early 1970s. Contempoary design. We acquired in 1977. Project was from 5/2011 to 11/2011. We had some specific ideas at outset, like remodel kitchen and baths, but more general undeveloped ideas for other improvements, like consolidating a small unused balcony room into a walk-in closet and enlarged bathroom. We moved out for 3 months. We never had any issues with Finecraft Contractors in clarity of work, the  timeliness of completing projects , or billings. We did not use an architect or interior designer. Instead we relied upon Finecraft to recommend enhancements we did not see or think about, which was a brilliant decision on our part. Finecraft (George in particular) had the ability to visualize a change which could be made to enhance a rooms appearance, and in many instances with little added costs. For example outside windows for an expanded master bathroom, or remaking a large outdated family room with a cathedral ceilng into a  dazzling room. We would recommend them without exception and use them again. It was indeed a pleasant experience. We continue to enjoy to this day their work"
5,"As a kitchen and Bath designer with 25 years of experience, I have worked with many different contractors.  Finecraft is one of the best that I have ever worked with.  They are true professionals and make all of my designs come to life for our clients.  I have hired them to do work on my own home and would not hesitate to recommend them for any project, large or small."
5,"As an Architect, I've had the pleasure of working with Finecraft Contractors and been able to count on George Papaheraklis' experience and knowledge on a couple of occasions.  Finecraft Contractors' work embodies the company's name in as much as the end result of their labors can truly be qualified as fine craft. George's and his crew's professionalism is apparent from the planning stages to the execution of the final punch list. I look forward to collaborating in the future with George and his firm and would recommend his services to our future clients at  plan Z  a r c h i t e c t s."
5,"Finecraft is an excellent home builder and home remodeling general contractor in the Washington, DC region. I have worked them them on at least 10 significant projects over as many years. What sets them apart are 4 strengths:
1. Their commitment to be faithful to the design created on paper and   not deviate from it without sufficient cause.
2. Their commitment to maintain a customers trust and confidence with them during the course of the work.
3. Their technical expertise makes for an enjoyable building process.
4. Above all else, their ability to finish a project strongly and completely. Customers naturally expect this but it is not all that common in the remodeling industry. It takes a highly committed professional general contractor that is adequately compensated to achieve this."
5,"Owner George Papaheraklis is close to finishing our second project.  One was demolishing a kitchen and family room, and making a single space with a ""bump out"" for a breakfast area.  Neighbors who know our community are amazed when they see it.  We have now gutted an old-style bathroom, vanity area and modest walkin closet and are making a larger integrated bathroom with a bigger walk in closet.

What distinguishes George is that he is an artist with a keen eye.  Not only will he tweak an architect's plans for aesthetic and functional reasons, but even as the project is in midstream, he is consstantly thinking, ""perhaps we should do it this way (a frame around tiling) or switch a regular door to a pocket door or change the orientation of the stall shower glass door. He obsesses about little details and, in the long run, that makes a big difference.

I found out about Finecraft in the house of a friend where George had gutted the back of the house and added on to it.  I had no doubt about the big picture and the attention to detail.  If any reader could see a typical Finecraft project up close, he would not have to rely on ramblings like this---he would see the work and know all he needs to know to hire the company."
5,"Finecraft Contractors completely revamped our family room.  Tore out old dated paneling, and 'popcorn' ceiling.  Now it is not all chopped up looking and it is calming to look into it.  Also they made custom bookcases on the sides of the fireplace that have ample storage below and great display space above.  I'm very pleased with the results and the respectful people who came into our home to do this work."
5,"Finecraft is an excellent construction company and a pleasure to work with.  George Papaherkalis has an excellent sense of design and constructions, his crews are skilled, and the final product is enjoyable space to live in.  I have hired them five times over 25 years and would use them again."
5,"Finecraft is an excellent company to work with.  Honest, reliable, creative, dependable and of course the attention to all the details are second to none, The crew are hard working and respectful. George is an inspiration and works so hard to come up with the best possible solutions for his clients.  The team thinks creatively and out of the box which is so unusual.  This is especially important in an historic renovation where sensitivity to the integrity of the house is key to bringing it back to life.
I would highly recommend 
George and his team."
5,Finecraft built us a brand new home from scratch and I could not have been happier with the work.  The attention to detail was outstanding and they were so nice and communicated so well with us throughout the process.  I would highly recommend them to anybody.
4,"When I work with George and his team of builders, I know that the final product is going to be beautiful.  He gets the details right, he understands our design goals, and he puts his heart and soul into the work.

5,"I have worked with Finecraft Contractors as a supply and design resource, on many projects over the years. George is very creative, exceptionally thoughtful, and he listens carefully and intently to the needs of his clients. He makes each project collaborative and enjoyable - always with the goal of getting the best result for his clients. He stays current on the latest in design and material possibilities, with a particular passion for quality construction. I would highly recommend George for any of your construction and design requirements"
5,"I am an architect that has worked with Finecraft on several residential projects and they do an excellent job.  Their craftsmanship and attention to detail is superb.  They are able to think in architectural terms and their sense of design and aesthetics is very reliable.  Their management of the construction process is well thought out, and benefits from years of experience.

On the contractual side, Finecraft is very good at negotiating the cost of a project, providing valuable input for economy and buildability without cutting corners.  

I find the whole Finecraft team a pleasure to work with.  I am happy to serve as a reference if necessary, and prospective clients may contact me at Studio One Architects (301.946.4601).  Robert Smith, Principal."
5,"I hired Finecraft to add a sunroom, new roof, portico and remodel 2 bathrooms. The work has been excellent with a foreman present at all times. The workmen are pleasant and helpful. They adhere to the highest standards in their work and I recommend them without reservation."
5,Finecraft built our house in 2012.  They did great work.  Really cared about our project and our family and it showed in the final project.
5,"I had the pleasure of hiring Finecraft for a project recently that called for the addition of an outdoor living area to my home. The level of detail and commitment to quality was unsurpassed. These are Craftsmen, not contractors.
It shows in every project they create.

5,"We had Barron do a complicated addition and remodel that added a bathroom and expanded the footprint of the house. No, they definitely were not the least expensive bid we got on the project. But they did really nice work, mostly on time and within budget (we expanded the scope of the project midway through, which added to the final cost and completion date). We were nervous going in, because friends of ours with similar or even smaller projects would complain about things taking much longer than promised and being ghosted for days by their project managers.

Fortunately, that wasn't the case with Barron. Leeran, the project manager, was very communicative and flexible, responding quickly to questions and issues while helping us stay within budget and make the most of what we could spend. Thanks to the company's willingness to work with us, we were able to stay in the house during the majority of the project — it wasn't easy for the construction crew to work around us (and our furniture), but it saved us a lot of money and allowed us to splurge in areas that were important to us.

We did run into a few problems along the way, but Leeran was very responsive and got things fixed or re-done quickly. As worried as we were about ballooning costs, unpleasant surprises and the project dragging on and on, I can't say enough how pleasantly surprised we were.

The addition is beautiful and the house is much more functional and enjoyable. (And our teenage daughter is thrilled to have her own bathroom.)"
1,"I'm very unhappy with my experience with Baron. We worked on a 1000 sq ft remodel that took over a year when it was originally quoted for 3-6 months. Months after, I'm still trying to clean up the mess they left me with and the damages they made to my house. It was a headache and complete stress working with them. They are the nightmare remodel that I hear others talk about. Our project managers did not remembered anything that was discussed and there was little to no follow through. They would say they were going to do something, or that this is how it would look, but then when it's done it's completely different and not what was discussed. Every meeting with the project managers ended up being pointless. I had to escalate many issues to the main office, and the owner, Mike, in order to get some type of acknowledgement, explanation or answer. HVAC was installed incorrectly, exterior hole in the wall was not repaired correctly, crew did not know how to install our cabinets, incorrect measurements which affected cabinet order and window order which was not returnable, patio furniture used as work benches, patio and yard used as a dumping ground, etc. We were the points that had to point out the issues and then argue with them to get it resolved when these are very simple things that should just be done correctly in the first place. Follow the manual, follow what city inspector expects, etc. I can't imagine the customers who don't know any better and assume things are okay when there could be bigger issues caused to their house in the long run."
5,"Finding a contractor that does quality work and is reliable is rare. My husband and I decided to remodel  90% of my childhood home and after meeting with six contractors, it was clear from the beginning that we wanted to work with Leeran. He was always prompt to our meetings/calls, explained things in an easily digestible manner, and was honest. 

This project was insanely important to my family as we had a lot of memories in the old home and the Baron crew created a new, modern home for us to make new memories in with our toddler. Leeran was one of the big reasons why our project got done on time (especially impressive during COVID) as he was extremely responsive. Anytime we had a question or needed his advice during the project, he was there to help answer questions, explain the timeline, help facilitate and project manage timelines with the crew/vendors, etc. 

We also worked with Noya, one of their interior designers, and she was so sweet and helpful in designing our home. She attended multiple meetings with us to understand our design aesthetic, shop with us for finishes (kitchen, tile, countertop), etc. 

I have been recommending Baron the entire time we’ve been working with them. Their work is top notch and having a PM dedicated to your project is a game changer. My husband and I are working parents with a toddler, so it was less stressful and not as overwhelming having Leeran help steer the project for us."
5,"I had a great experience working with Leeran and the Baron constructions. Our project was based in Sunnyvale while we were living in San Francisco with a less than two year old toddler, in the middle of the pandemic. We were redoing 2/3rd of our home which entailed large structural changes. We knew this wasn't going to be easy and we wanted to go with the best in the area. 

For day 1, Leeran and the firm were punctual, outright honest and very collaborative making them one of the most dependable contractors I've ever worked with. In the early days, I remember brainstorming layouts with Leeran late into the night over zoom. He was always very accommodating, open to creative ideas and sharing this experience to keep the project feasible. When it came to quotes, while Baron was a bit on the higher side, I knew I was going to get what I'm paying for. So we decided to go with them. 

The project had a very tight deadline as our lease in SF was ending in March and we were starting this project in early October. Leeran stayed on top of it throughout. Even when there were hiccups like when we found out our ducts needed to be replaced and one of our structural beam was infected with termites, Leeran added more workforce instead of pushing out the finish date. Leeran has a fabulous team of people he works with. From the architect to the designer, everyone was such a pleasure to work with. From finalizing permits to ordering finished materials, everything was so systematic and well planned that I'm afraid I'm spoiled for life. 

The final product of their work was above and beyond my expectations. When I shared the photos with my friends and family, I had to convince them that they are not photoshopped. (Checkout out the Kitchen & Bathrooms Design & Remodel project from Sunnyvale)

I highly recommend Leeran and Baron Constructions. If I had to do it all over again, I'd go with Barons again."
5,"We started working with Baron Construction this year on a multi-stage project and we are about to complete Phase I of it - a full Kitchen/Living room remodel to a modern farmhouse. Leeran is our Project Manager throughout the project.  Overall I am very happy with the work so far and how the new Kitchen / Living room area is shaping up.

Like any renovation project there are surprises and complexities you encounter along the way - and while not everything always goes according to original plan, I truly appreciate working on this with Leeran - we are able to work through it together, evaluate different ideas an options and were able come up with reasonable solutions to all problems along the way. I also appreciate the completeness of the work and ensuring we get a higher quality finished product which meets code - Leeran ensures the work is done right above everything else.

I look forward to continuing our work together in Phase II of the project."
5,"They rebuilt our shower to exacting specifications. We are in love with the resulting artwork, which is sturdy and beautiful. I highly recommend the services."
5,There is a lot of unethical behavior on the part of the staff. They do not respond to calls and don't care about the customers. I had a very bad experience!
5,"This company's service is overpriced, and their staff is unprofessional. It is a shady business and I regret choosing them. They have been refusing to give me a refund for two weeks. The service has been inconvenient for me."
1,"BUYER BEWARE - If you are thinking of hiring Baron Construction (Or, David) to do any major work - think twice! The company is a complete disaster and incompetence. They don't understand architectural or structural plans or even care about doing so. 
On their website Baron Construction claim that ""We are LA's premier Design-Build Contractor with over 55+ years of combined experience."", but their presence in the SF Bay Area is a mess.
Their approach is to sign you up for a high-premium contact, and then hire half-cost subcontractors and provide zero supervision to any work. Subcontractors do whatever they think, sometimes not even up to Code, with zero guidance or supervision from GC. Subcontractors make costly mistakes, for which Baron Construction will charge you. Subcontractors damage expensive finishing materials and nobody at Baron Construction takes responsibility! Don't bother. Take your money somewhere else where you will get quality, communication, and responsibility. We hired Baron Construction to build our dream home, and with the project still unfinished, it turned to be a nightmare all way along. Baron Construction had promised us completion in 9 months but turned it into over 2.5 years project. We had no choice but to fire Baron Construction and it took other General Contractor a long time to correct all mistakes Baron Construction and its subcontractors had made."
5,"Have you ever envisioned and dreamed of improving your home?! We have for a very long time! And with the help of a talented Baron team, and great delegation by Sean, the project manager, we’re now living in our dream home! Despite many setbacks this year, due to pandemic, Baron team made our vision a reality!"
5,"We hired the Baron team to turn our historic San Jose craftsman house into our dream home and could not be happier.  It was a major project, including converting an unfinished low-ceiling basement into permitted living space, an addition to the main floor, and rebuilding most of the structure while keeping some of the original redwood bones and craftsman charm that other builders didn’t want to touch.  Ron and Eli have been with us every step of the way, from architectural drawings and shepherding plans through the city, to major excavation and framing, now to the last finishing touches.  Whether Baron employees or hired subcontractors, everyone on the job has done top notch work and displayed pride in their craft.  Big shout outs to Salvador the framer for stopping at nothing short of perfection and to Courtney the interior designer for helping turn our ideas into a reality beyond our dreams.  We will be raising our family in a beautiful home and creating many memories for years to come.  Thank you Baron!"
5,"Our home was built in the 1950s and needed some major work.  What started as the wish to add central heat turned into a entire home remodel with the help of Baron.  We bid out several companies for plans, and Ron was personable, kind & asked great leading questions.  He returned with three options (Good / Better / Best) and provided the reasoning behind them all.  He was knowledgeable of the requirements of our city, plus had great suggestions on how to better our ideas.  

In the end, we ended up adding 400 square feet, plus brought the entire home down to the studs.  We updated everything - from the roof, to plumbing, to electrical, to the stucco around the house.  The end product is absolutely gorgeous, and we are thrilled with the work that was done.  

The project completed on time - and although over budget, it was due to unforeseen circumstances (lead / asbestos) and beautiful add ons like our newly vaulted great room ceiling and front of the house upgrade.  The on time portion was essential though - as with SIP starting due to COVID-19, we were able to return to our home from the small apartment we were staying in.  Ron kept the team on schedule and pushed hard to ensure we could come back ASAP.  

I highly recommend Baron - especially Ron as the PM on the job.  Between his ability to keep the project on schedule, and Courtney's amazing eye for interior design - we are proud to have our kitchen & master bath featured on Baron's website: Home Expansion & Renovation"
5,"Very professional, prompt, and they do great work! Highly recommended. Obi was always reachable by phone and responded promptly to all queries. Extremely pleased."
5,"We remodeled our 30-year old kitchen and appreciate the job that Baron did.  We especially appreciate the work of Obi, the Project Manager, who kept track of the various sub-contractors and their schedules.  As with any remodeling project there were hiccups along the way, and his sense of humor and commitment to quality helped us a lot.  We love the finished product."
5,"I used Baron for design & build for a master suite (bedroom & bath) addition on my house.    They did a great job.  The quality of work was high and they worked through a number of unexpected challenges that popped up along the way.  The project took a bit longer than originally expected, but very happy with the final results."
5,"Baron is great to work with. They are respectful and responsive and their work turned out great! They have experts in lighting, plumbing, etc."
5,"We worked with Baron Construction and specifically project manager Ron Hogen to remodel our 120 year old Victorian home. It was a long and complicated project, that was basically a gut job for a significant portion of the house - involved a completely new kitchen great room (relocated the kitchen to a new part of the house), laundry room, bedroom, 3 bathrooms, butler pantry, finished basement and more. Now as I sit in my beautiful new and sparkling kitchen great room, I can whole-heartedly recommend Ron and Baron Construction for your project. Looking back on our project - yes there were ups and downs, and some challenges, as you would expect with the extent of our project, especially given we lived in the house through most of it. However, Ron maintained open communication and transparency throughout. He was dedicated, responsive, and accommodating. Their price was extremely competitive, and in the end they finished very close to the original bid, (most of the change orders were initiated by us). We are happy with the quality of their work, and they didn't close the project until all the final minor adjustments were perfect. We will be calling them for any future projects."
5,"I was very pleased with baron construction, especially Etel’s project management. She was very professional and accommodated our quick turn with this remodel. She was attentive with my concerns and responded quickly with questions. If something didn’t work, Etel went beyond to do the research to figure out a solution. I would recommend Etel to anyone."
5,"My wife and I needed one of our bedrooms completely re-built (flooring, ceiling, walls, insulation, painting) AND we wanted to completely renovate the attached bathroom. For starters, I will admit I am extremely particular. I scheduled consultation appointments with 5 contractors, all of which had great reviews on Yelp and other sites. From prior personal experience and friends' experiences with contractors, their reputation on the street is not that great (poor communication, lack of timeliness, etc). After all the consultations, I decided to go with Baron Construction. For the record, they were not the cheapest, but their offer was fair and I felt good about our project manager, Leeran Shlomo. Our project is now complete and I have to say I feel very good about selecting Baron Construction and Leeran Shlomo. Leeran proved to be anything other than the contractor stereotypes I mentioned above. He was personable, friendly, a GREAT communicator, and he made himself available almost anytime (even before 8 am and up until 10 pm at night sometimes). His customer service was superb. I would highly recommend Baron Construction and this is almost directly attributable to our experience with Leeran Shlomo. The project manager can make your life really smooth or miserable. Leeran managed our project extremely well and kept us updated almost daily. If you can select Leeran, I would highly, highly recommend him! He's awesome!"
2,"Never gave them the contract. Just too expensive. Got 3 more quotes from licensed and bonded contractors and trust me they were 8 times more expensive. 
Maybe they are good at doing fabulous job but I’ll settle at 95% great job at 1/8th the price. 
2 stars for the “project manager” who was patient, spent time to understand needs."
5,"My husband and I decided to renovate our kitchen. After getting some estimates, we decided to choose Baron construction. This job included removing a wall, two fireplaces, all cabinets, countertops and appliances and then installing new fireplace, cabinets, quartz waterfall island, quartz countertops and backsplash. 

Every construction project has some hiccups here and there, ultimately it's the end products that count. We are very pleased with our new kitchen and fireplace. The quartz for the island was cut and installed wonderfully. Wow factors are definitely there.

An incremental payment schedule was provided. All changes during the project were itemized and approved by us prior to work. We paid as various stages of the work were completed.

Overall, We are happy with the way our kitchen turned out and we could not be more pleased with Baron Construction and all the products of their team's work."
5,"My project manager, Lital, was beyond fabulous.  She was both professional and personal.  Professional in every aspect from start to finish and yet personal in the way she listened to me and put my wants and needs at the forefront.  I would absolutely call her again if the need would ever arise.  Cant say enough good things about her and how she handled my project."
5,"We just completed a complicated kitchen remodel and full bath remodel with Baron Construction.  The project was completed on time, actually early, and for the most part within budget.  There are always a few surprises with a project dealing with an 80 year old house and constraints imposed by our first major remodel a number of years ago, not to mention current building codes.  Our project manager Eli and his assistant Obi where wonderful to work with and the Baron’s management model is unique and ensures positive communication and rapid problem solving throughout the project process.  Further, the actual work did not start until all critical decisions were made and key materials in place or their delivery date assured, e.g. new kitchen cabinets.  This was essential to project timing and minimizing our disruption. 

In addition, the on site construction crew was amazing.  They were there every day, as promised, and a pleasure to have in our house.  Fernando is a master craftsman and even the Palo Alto building inspector told us (in front of Fernando) that he was an amazing builder who did everything according to best practices and worked to perfection. He solves problems and is so conscientious. What a prize Baron has in Fernando....and those who work with him as well. 

Our new kitchen cabinets had to to fit exact specifications for a variety of reasons and this was very important to us.  Eli and Obi did meticulous measurements and the cabinet makers did an excellent job as did the installers, Marco and Carlos.  They worked hard to have the cabinets just perfectly placed. They were true perfectionists. 

Eli and Obi were more than fair in listening to our requests and satisfying our needs.  They worked around our schedule to insure work timing was handled correctly.  And, when the few problems did occur, the Baron’s team was on top of them and they were resolved to keep the project on track and meet our specific needs. 

The contract for the work was fair.  The only real issue for us was that the allowances were somewhat low.  We went over because we selected more expensive products. We would encourage more generous allowances with the contract budget adjusted accordingly. 

Overall we could not be more pleased with Baron Construction, their management team and all the products of their full team’s work.  We are thrilled with our finished product and would certainly use Baron again. A big Thank You!!!"
5,"Baron rebuilt our shower to exacting specifications after a previous tile replacement done with another contractor failed just like the original tile.  The resulting work is sturdy and beautiful, and we couldn't be happier with the results.

We had the pleasure of working with Eddie on project management and Lucas as our foreman.  Both Eddie and Lucas were very prompt, professional, and knowledgeable.  Any time we had a question, they were available to answer.  Although it didn't have any material effect on the job, we also really enjoyed just chatting with Eddie and Lucas when they were around.  Everyone we dealt with felt warm and genuine and it made the whole process a lot more pleasant.

Now, the work wasn't cheap and we did have some overruns on time estimates, but nothing outrageous.  When something would go longer than expected, Eddie always kept us in the loop as to why.

All things considered, we would absolutely use Baron again and would recommend them to anyone who's willing to pay for great craftsmanship."
5,"Craftsmanship at Baron Construction is world class!  We had the pleasure of working with project manager Ron who worked with us from project definition all the way till the everything was fully completed including the professional power wash to remove any type of debris on the drive way.  Ron was with us every step of the way throughout the project and was always super responsive via phone/email/txt.   In addition, Ron always came over to check-in with us to ensure we're happy with the progress and accommodated to our busy schedule by coming in later in the evenings after we're done with the kids' dinner.

We contacted Baron in Dec 2017 when we purchased our home and wanted them to update 3 of the bathrooms.  After a walk through of the existing bathrooms, measurements were taken and we received a formal detailed quote.  The 2nd best aspect (the best being their quality of work) of working with Baron is how they never nickle and dimed us - what we paid for the project was exactly what they quoted at the start + fair adjustments due to us adding wet-walls in 2 of the bathrooms (which we didn't want initially when we started the project).

The only criticism we had with Baron is the length of time it took the finish the bathrooms. We were originally told it'd take 3-4 months and it ended up taking 6 months.  Part of that is our fault because we had guests over and had to stop construction for a couple of weeks which caused downstream delays. The wait was well worth it because the masterful work of Sergio (who does tiles) was simply amazing.  Overall we were extremely happy with the way the bathrooms turned out so we just wanted to take a few mins to acknowledge their amazing work here on Houzz!"
4,We recently had our bathroom remodeled and hired baron construction. Everyone was professional and courteous. We were very happy with the results and would recommend to others.
5,"As a Realtor my responsibility is to my clients. When my sellers wanted to do improvements to their investment property in preparation for Sale we chose Barron Construction for the job they were AMAZING! they took all the headache out of the renovation they acquired the permits,offered insight to the design and materials and even when we hit budget snag they were able to accommodate Eli and his team were super professional and skilled. The property sold before ever hitting the market while under construction and was over our target price all cash 7 day close. Everybody was happy. Will definitely call on them when I have another project. And so should you."
5,"I interviewed Mike Baron, owner of Baron Construction & Remodeling Co, to remodel my ranch style home to an up to date open concept look. I knew within 10 minutes that this was going to be a good working relationship and I was going to hire his company for this project. The first thing that impressed me was I had a long list of things I wanted done and he glanced at it, put it aside and just listened to my ideas. We did a walk through the house and the first thing he noticed was the foundation in the TV room was sloping and needed to be replaced. This was not on my list but he recommended this be my first priority and I’m glad I agreed. The moldy musty smell that was plaguing me disappeared and the floor is now even. 

I was fortunate to have Mike work with me on the whole project. As a client I appreciated the consistency and confidence working with one person and helping with the design and selection of materials. This was very important to me and high on my list. I also appreciated working with the same onsite people when possible.

The scope of the project entailed new wood floors, crown molding and baseboards throughout the house. A beautiful custom fitted cabinet under a wall mounted TV with matching floating shelves in the front room. 

The entryway into the kitchen was enlarged to give it the open concept look I wanted. The kitchen was enhanced with a quartz countertop, sink, beautiful backsplash, shaker cabinets/drawers and hardware.

Replacing the old brick with natural stone and a streamline mantle changed the existing fireplace.

The master shower was gutted and replaced with a decorative mosaic tile strip, large complimentary tiles for the shower walls and bathroom floor, frameless glass shower doors and an infinity drain. The mosaic tile was also used as the backsplash behind the bathroom sinks and an area behind the toilet. 

The interior walls were freshly painted with an accent wall in the living room and TV room. The exterior of the house took on a whole new look with a change of color. 

I do want to qualify that it appears that the project took a long time but this was my decision not the contractor. We have two additional projects that will be completed this year and I will be finished with my long dream list!

So the questions are: Would I hire Baron Construction & Remodeling Co again; would I recommend this company to others; Am I happy with the results? Answer: Absolutely."
2,"I wish I could give only 1 star; the 2nd star is for what they have done right. I read through all the spectacular reviews below so I chose them, but ended up really painful experience which will be unforgettable once in my life time. This is a really long story I have with them. 

Mike appears to be a nice guy and promise whatever you ask; claim they could deliver your dream project. But when coming down to day-to-day project execution, it will be your big nightmare and you are doomed if you go with them.

I just finished a very large addition project with them and the following are the pitfalls:
1) the contract only lists the major items but not down to all the details. In the beginning they alluded that they always write contract this way and not worry about the details; but later on when specific details were requested they argued that those were not included in the contract and would be considered as change order items for extra cost.
2) no interior designer provided: in the contract they promised to offer an interior designer to complete my ideas and discuss all the details to select proper fixtures for my huge addition project. However the first 2 designers quit after first contact; the 3rd one agreed to take this job but couldn't receive my ideas accurately nor complete the design in the booked time frame. I ended up doing the rough design on my own with limited knowledge without any professional assistance. Had to decide and made all the purchases myself. This is in disagreement to the contract.
3) upon signing the contract they claimed they would have 4-6 people on the job site everyday; but that only happened in the first 2 weeks. After 2-3 months they began to not have full crew working full time on your project. On some days even no one showed up due to various excuses. Then the GC began to take vacations or go out of town for personal issues.
4) They claim to progress very fast so they want you to have all the fixtures ready or some jobs would be delayed in order to wait for the parts. So I had to get almost all parts early on in a short time but then realized they'd reach that task much later.
5) Very poor in communication. They send multiple people to interface with you and they are sometime inconsistent within themselves. Not all the parties are on the same page all the time. You need to deal with different people with different personalities and responsibility in one project. And the real working contractors are another different group of people.
6) They'd break the fixtures you buy. The stuff are all stored in the garage before getting used; after long time they may not be able to find specific parts you prepared and claim them missing, or parts may get scratched or broken due to careless handling so you end up buying same items twice.
7) The raining season came before the roof was installed, and they didn't do proper treatment to prevent water damage. Only simple tarp was laid on the frame which collapsed in the evening storm and my existing living room was flooded because the rain leaked through the roof/wall crack they made. When I expressed my concern to them regarding the water-damaged wood frame/wall/floor, they simply shrugged it off saying it'd dry out over time. If they are real professional they should know that the water-damaged wood will be distorted and becomes very hard even after drying out. And the wall will not be evenly flat and becomes wavy in some sections.
8) the floor in the extended living room area is not level with the existing flooring. The flooring was fully renewed in the integrated living room but you can feel the slope in the extended area. When the issue was brought to them Mike first said he'd send some other guy to investigate it; then that guy simply said he couldn't feel the difference and attributed it to the new wood accommodation. 
9) they may do well if your project is quite standardized in that everything just gets replaced without any particular design change. With not too many customization your project would be delayed. In the beginning they claimed to complete my project in 6 months; then it ended up to take 13 months.
10) their secretary's attitude is very poor. When they want to collect payment they want it right away and would harass you in email. But when you request them to fix something they'd have various personal excuses. 

Above are just the major pitfalls what I could remember after 13 months; there are so many miscellaneous minor complains which I cannot list them all. After all, if you choose them, you won't have peace in mind during your project and the journey will be winding, as they are not professional enough to handle projects in modern style."
5,"I worked with Baron Construction & Remodeling Co. on several occasions photographing projects they completed. Each time I was able to witness first-hand uncompromised quality of their work: the beautiful, functional designs, attention to the smallest details, happy home owners. I am confident to recommend their services to even more discerning clients."
5,"I would highly recommend Baron Construction & Remodeling.  We were working with another GC to add a bathroom and new kitchen.  The project was to have been completed in eight months.  Instead it took more than a year and a half and the project was still not completed. My husband and I were very stressed and frustrated as the GC and workers did not show up to work everyday.  
Baron Construction was doing a remodel for three of my neighbors.  They were all very happy with Baron Construction.  We decided to part ways with our GC. Mike decided to help us finish our project so we would pass our final inspection. Needless to say, we were  very happy and relieved to be working with Mike Baron.  He checked the job site often and saw that things ran very smoothly for us.  Everyone from the job crew to the office staff is very professional, friendly, and efficient.  Very happy with the quality of their work. Each project has been completed in a timely manner. We still have little projects that they are helping us correct from the last GC.  I would highly recommend them."
5,"My wife and I wanted our old home to wear a new look. So, we consulted the Mike of Baron Construction- with his crew- to make our dream come true. The task was deftly executed, and each day ends with a general cleaning even till the last day of the work. Our experience with them was quite awesome – every time they resume work, the atmosphere seems like a family reunion, Mike and his crew diffuse warmth and friendliness each day. Now, our home is a place of regular visit for our friends. All thanks to Mike and his crew for their best shot that changed our old house forever into the best we can ever think of."
5,"I can't say enough how helpful Eli Levy and Mike Baron were in our construction project. We started with a master bath and kids bath remodel, but the project soon expanded to the entire upstairs. Eli and crew were easy to work with, extremely detail oriented, and had great suggestions throughout the process. Even as we expanded the scope of our project, Eli kept the project moving and we were quickly finished with an entire floor remodel. We couldn't be more happy with the results and even look forward to our next project."
5,"We really enjoyed our remodeling process with Baron. We interviewed a couple of contractors and are glad that we made the right choice. Eli has been really pleasant to work with from the very beginning through the end. He is responsive, professional and paid attention to details. Luis and Emilio, who worked onsite were fairly hard-working and friendly. Though it took a bit longer and extra rework to install the tiles perfectly, it was an overall smooth and efficient process. We love our freshly updated home when we wake up every morning."
5,"I never thought that remodeling could be as hassle-free as Mike and his team made it to be. Last year, my husband and I had a grand plan to remodel our kitchen. We had been getting into cooking and loved entertaining that we felt it was time to make the plunge! I learned about Baron Construction from a friend who spoke very highly of them. All I can say is that our decision to get our kitchen remodeled and to work with Mike has been ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS for our family ever. The whole process went by smoothly. We set up an estimate and then they promptly started with the work. They made the house very livable and they were there to answer any questions. Now the finished product was wonderful! I don't know how we could have waited this long for the kitchen remodel. We got our dream kitchen and even if our home was built in 1988, it made our house look brand new. The cost was reasonable and very worth it due to high quality. Very satisfied and I cannot wait to get other parts of the home done by Mike and team too."
5,"Of all my years managing my home, i have never encountered a contractor as reliable, creative and efficient as Baron Construction. These folks are the best and i would only trust remodeling my home with them! They worked on my kitchen, guest bedroom and living room and kept the place clean throughout the process. It was very liveable to come home. They respected the place and did a fantastic final job at a great price! I never knew my kitchen could look like one out of the magazines but they gave very useful design advice. I would get them again for all future jobs! Communication was polite and very consistent as well. Six stars!!!"
5,"I am not a fan of remodeling projects. I am always worried that the time and effort is too tedious for our household, given that I work full time and manage a small business. Mike and the team at Baron changed all of this. Remodeling was hassle-free because they kept the entire house clean throughout the process. They listened to us about what design we wanted and delivered on it. Everytime we had a question, the team was always one call away. I never thought our bathroom and masters bedroom can look as beautiful as it is now. Next: my kitchen! I will only trust them. Great value for money. Prices are on point and you can see the high quality."
5,"I used Baron for an extensive kitchen remodeling job, as well as new flooring and ceilings.  The management of the job was excellent, with lots of design advice and guidance, flexibility in accomodating my personal choices, and high level of expertise in all phases and areas of the job, which included complete demolition of the existing kitchen, installing all rough plumbing and electrical, new flooring (tile and wood), new cabinetry, and painting throughout.  Eli, especially, was terrific at managing the whole thing. The crew was always respectful and courteous."
5,"When you work with Mike, Eli, Oded and Cheryl, you get great customer service and amazing work. I've tried other contractors in the past, but the quality of their work is literally the BEST in the market. Highly recommend!"
5,"My bathroom called for a much-needed makeover... I had been thinking about it for years. I heard from a friend that renovating bathroom would increase value of the house, so I said game let's do it. I asked around for the best contractors in the South Bay and instantly got drawn to the team of Mike and Eli of Baron Construction in Saratoga. From my first inquiry, they were patient with taking me through the entire process.  They came promptly for a free estimate. They listened to my design and gave valuable inputs. They were experts in constructing and were very efficient way - being sensitive to my budget and true to my vision. The construction came and went and it was a breeze! I did not stress about anything because they guided me throughout the process - plumbing, design, materials, labor! I couldn't be happier with the end result. My bathroom is exactly how I imagined it and more. I will definitely call them again for my future projects. THEY ARE THE BEST!"
5,"Best re-modelers in the Bay Area! They are extremely trustworthy, no hidden costs and are patient in answering any questions. I showed them a picture of my dream kitchen and everything exceeded my expectations - the finish seems very good, the lighting is perfect and the paint is amazing! They know their design stuff. These guys are the real deal."
5,Baron Construction has made my dream home a reality! I never thought my patio and living room had the potential to be a designer home but they did it. At a very reasonable price too. Very satisfied with the work!!!
5,"Baron woah , just  woahhh ! amazing work done by guyz . love you guyz, i'd prefer to hire you again, one of my favourites in Saratoga , 
me & my wife wants new kitchen,  you guyz did the job very well, great work indeed"

5,"Eli Levy of Baron Construction and his crew, Luis and Fernando, did an outstanding kitchen remodel – on time and within budget! Eli was very patient with our first major renovation and helped us pick out flooring, cabinets and handles, backsplash, countertops, sink, disposal, and lighting. Moreover, he also brought the walls, insulation, electrical, the junction box and smoke/CO detectors up to code in the original time estimated. Luis and Fernando were polite and worked long hours to finish their projects, letting us know when they were starting or finishing for the day. They cleaned up at the end of every day and Eli gave the kitchen a professional cleaning at the end. They even did little extras like putting in a dimmer switch and installing an under-the-counter toaster oven. Our most positive renovation ever and I hardly recommend Eli, Luis, Fernando and Baron Construction.
Mike and Carol C. Menlo Park"
5,"Baron Construction & Remodeling is the BEST contractor that I have EVER worked with. The quality of workmanship is beyond excellent. They were constantly in touch with us making sure we were satisfied with the work in process. If we had a question they would immediately respond. Fantastic Customer Care!! So if you want to have a ""Wow"" experience with a contractor just give them a call."
5,"My husband and I have been wanting to redo our kitchen and we finally had the opportunity to do so earlier this year. Since we have never done any renovation project before, we decided to research online and found a website that allowed us to reach out to several companies. We collected 5 companies, one of which is Baron Construction. They were the first one to contact us via email. We narrowed our choices down to three companies and set up appointments to meet with them. We met Eli and we immediately connected. We had a vision of how we wanted our kitchen to be and this is something ""out of the box"". Eli understood our vision despite it being different from most of his clients' and he assured us every step of the way that he will carry out this vision. This was very important to us. Bottom line is, after 8 weeks of patience, our kitchen turned out to be what we had envisioned it to be. Eli and Baron Construction delivered what they promised to deliver and we are very happy with the result. We have since hosted parties at our home and have received very positive feedback on the kitchen. We will not hesitate to recommend Eli and Baron Construction to my friends and family. Keep up the good work."
5,"As remodeling jobs go, ours was rather small (under $50K) but you would never know that from the attention we received from Mike and Eli at Baron Construction. We had a minor problem with one of their sub-contractors, but it was resolved immediately and the bottom line is that the job was done in a timely manner and we are extremely pleased with the results. Mike's design suggestions were spot-on and without them, the results would not have been as good as they were."
5,"While we did not hire Baron Construction for our current project given a pre-existing relationship with another contractor, we were very impressed by the professionalism and responsiveness of this company. We contacted several firms and Baron stood out. Jesse came to our home for an initial consultation and immediately followed up with another visit to go through the proposal in detail - and we found both the proposed scope and budget to be very fair. We will definitely consider Baron in the future."
5,"My parents shopped around for a while before Baron Co and Remodeling. They made it worth the search. Very respectful of our ideas, and the kitchen was finished with great attention to detail. Would recommend them to anyone. May use them again for a bathroom
In the future."
5,"My partner and I contracted Baron Construction after we bought our home.  I was referred to him by a friend, since she had previously hired him to do a bathroom upgrade. Our wash room and kitchen needed an upgrade for what seemed to be the longest. The previous owners had done little to no work on the house. He did an amazing job. Both, my partner and I were left satisfied from the work done on both rooms. Great attitude, and great service."
5,"Very satisfied with this company and their services. From the first consultation all the way down to the last day of business, there was a sense of urgency and attention to my needs as the customer. My kitchen had lots of work to be done so I was honestly surprised all deadlines were met. All my requests were met, even the paint in the downstairs bathroom came out exactly as I had envisioned. I would recommend this companies services to anyone who wants a Grade A job done to turn their house into a home. :)"
5,"i Shopped around for a couple of companies, asked around to friends and I still was not sure. I was able to read about the company and had heard from a friend who had recently used their services to do the entrance of their home. After the initial contact I knew this was the right choice. The representative sent to my house was on time, friendly and seemed to be interested in the overall look I was going for. Even though I wanted a much more intricate look they were able to bring my idea to a reality and within the budget in a timely matter. And most of all it was done according to HOA regulations. I would seriously like to recommend them to my friends who need any jobs around the house."
5,"highly recommend this company, I am so pleased with the work that Mike has done. My kitchen looks brand new! Was very respectful of my ideas as well. Might have them do some more work for my home in the future."
5,"I could not be more pleased with the professionalism they have shown me. The 2 bathrooms at my house needed some remodeling. The sight of the floor, the sink, and the tub looked so outdated. They did an amazing job in transforming it. I couldn't be more happy to use my bathroom. My son was surprised when he saw his bathroom. They remodeled his tub as well as the flooring. He is excited to finally take a bubble bath in it. Their pricing is very fair, the material they have is excellent, and I loved how they take the time to listen to what you want (especially if you are detail orientated like me). This company has been so helpful that I will definitely refer them to friends and family."
5,The estimate I was given was fair. I received three other estimates and I feel I was given a fair quote for the work I wanted.
5,"I contracted with Baron Construction a about 3 months ago, I wanted to wait on writing review to make sure that the work was completed and in properly working condition. 

From the very first initial call, all the way through the completion of my kitchen and bathroom remodel my experience was amazing! My husband and I had just purchased our first home (which needed major upgrades) and we were a bit scared for lack of better words that someone would see that we are a young couple and would take advantage of us... a friend referred us to Baron Construction and  Mike was great! He sat with us and listened to what we wanted and all of the ideas we had and made those ides come to life. He even added an island! which I though wouldn't be possible.  He worked with us every step of the way.  Our kitchen and bathrooms are beautiful!!! 

We did end up going above our initial budget since his work is a bit pricey, but in the end it was well worth it! it's true what they say... you get what you paid for. And we LOVE the end result. The quality of his work speaks for itself. Our house finally became a home and we couldn't be more pleased. Thanks guys! 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
5,"My home needed a real make over. Specially my patio and fireplace. I'm very picky on who I will have working in my home. We had different vendors come out and give us estimates. Baron Construction and Remodeling CO gave us that feeling that everything was going to be taken care of the way we wanted our home to look like. From providing an estimate, clear explanation on how things were going to be done from beginning to end and last but not least great customer service. We were given the option to choose a date on when was more convenient to us, for them to come work in our home, of course within a range of dates they had available. From the moment they arrived at our home until the moment we came back. Everything was very well organized and on point. Phenomenal structure and workflow. With that being said I couldn't have chosen a better company to come and remodel our home. Extremely satisfied with the remodeling. Phenomenal work Baron Construction and Remodeling Co. Most definitely will recommend and will keep you for future remodeling in our home"
5,"My patio looks amazing! I mean, really! And we wouldn’t have been able to procure the perfect backyard without Baron. They were smart, helpful attentive and totally affordable. As soon as they were done I knew I had to write a review – a really, really good review. 

From start to finish Eli and crew were totally on our side. From planning to production, they considered what we wanted, and figured out a way to incorporate almost every single detail. The finished result looked exactly like the picture I had in my head – my dream backyard was finally a reality. 

I have to mention the price! Most companies I spoke to before hand wanted an arm and leg just to talk, but our guys at Baron quoted us appropriately AND our bill stayed the same from first quote to finished product – I couldn’t believe it! These guys are not only skilled but trustworthy too. 

In the end, we really loved working with them and would recommend to anyone looking for an equally positive experience with their remodel."
5,"Right away, I knew that this review would be a positive one - I have nothing but great things to say about the entire Baron construction crew. From day one, I felt fully informed with what needed to be done to retrofit our roof, and the lead on the project kept us in the loop through every minuscule detail, throughout the entire process. Not only am I completely satisfied with our newly secured roof, I HAVE to say that I felt completely secure having the team in and around my house unsupervised. PLUS they cleaned up after themselves every single day. How many construction companies can you say that about? On top of that, I got a fair price for the work they did, which stayed relatively the same throughout the entire process. No up sells or added costs for work they didn’t explain to me in detail. Overall we are more than happy with our choice – would definitely recommend Baron to anyone with retrofitting needs."
5,"We hired them to make some major repairs to the exterior of an older home we just bought. The repairs were related to dry rot and water damage to eaves and siding identified in the termite report.

They listened to what we wanted done and our priorities. They kept us informed as they progressed through the work and consulted us in a timely manner when needed. They worked consistently but did not rush. We were particularly concerned when we learned parts of our metal roof would have to be removed to do a proper repair. We had no need to be concerned however because they did a great job of replacing all the roofing tiles so you could not even tell they had been removed. We recently purchased this house and it is over 40 years old. We had no idea if they would find other damage when the siding was removed. They didn't and we really appreciated that they did not take advantage of us in that way.

The workers were professional, friendly and very skilled. Everything they did looks great and we were surprised at what a great job they did matching the old paint.  The siding repairs are not obvious and look fine with the rest of the siding that was untouched. They cleaned up thoroughly when they were done too."
5,"After our second child was born, I realized we needed to add another room to our home. The problem was that I wasn’t quite sure how we could do it because our was already cramped with small rooms. After a few recommendations, I called Baron Construction & Remodeling and told them the issue that I was having and they sent over a representative. We went through my home and he quickly noticed that the attic could be turned into another room with a small staircase added. It made perfect sense and the added stairs would not take up much room. 
So, after getting the estimate we set the appointment date and the work started on our new room. From the start I noticed the professionalism and work ethic from Baron Construction & Remodeling who seemed eager to take on the challenge of building our new room in the attic. During that time, they worked with us when we had to be gone so that everything would flow smoothly. To my surprise, the job was completed a bit ahead of time and I was lead through the entire room to make sure it was to my specifications. 
All in all, I was very pleased with Baron Construction & Remodeling as they did a great job of creating a new room out of our unused attic space. Now we have the extra room in our home needed all for a price that fit our budget. I cannot recommend the professionals at Baron Construction & Remodeling enough for their work."
5,"We reached out to several different vendors, but decided to go with Baron even though they weren't the cheapest.  We were naturally skeptical in having a relationship with any contractor, but our conversations with Mike and Eli regarding the finer points of the work estimate and the timeliness schedule of the work gave us the confidence we were looking for, so we pulled the trigger and went with Baron.  We made sure to be as flexible as we could be regarding timing, and I stayed in the house for the duration of the work.
The day before the work started, Eli called me to make sure I knew what to expect, as this was my first remodel of this scope.  Eli came out to the site, and we talked through where the majority of the work was going to take place, and what I could expect during and after the construction on each day.  I work from home, and was able to spend quite a bit of time being annoying and poking around the worksite, asking questions of the various crews that wereperforming work (foundation, framing, plumming, etc).  I'd talk with Eli every couple of days, and they were very flexible with my indecision, and periodic changes.  My wife went back and forth on what she wanted to do about a dozen times, and Eli had the patience of a saint, and made sure we got what we wanted.
Overall, the various crews were neat, punctual, and friendly, and the management was available and attentive, ! I was able to speak to someone when I needed to, and they were understanding in how stressful this process can be for a homeowner.  These guys were great! I highly recommend them!"
5,"My husband and I were referred to Baron by two different sources - the top pick from an online search by Home Advisor, and by my friend's parents. I was able to see my friend's parents recent kitchen remodel that was completed by Baron's project manager, Eli Levy, and his crew from Baron Construction. We own a 68 year old home and planned to remove a load bearing wall which separated our kitchen and living room in order to have an ""open concept"" living space. We also had our one and only main bathroom of the house completely remodeled by Baron as well. 

We met with Eli shortly after we signed all of the paperwork to begin the job in order to select the products that we wanted in our kitchen and bathroom at the warehouse and showroom. Eli's expertise and eye for design really helped in the process of shopping for our dream kitchen. The estimated timeline when we signed on to complete the job from start to finish was about 8 weeks.We worked with Baron and the structural engineer, and they were able to completely hide the massive load-bearing beam into the ceiling so the look of the kitchen and living space is seamless and beautiful. 

Of course, with all construction projects, it is crucial to constantly check on the contractors' work and job progress. My husband and I went to check on the house on a daily basis and always communicated with Eli on any issues that we had. We hired a moving company and completely moved out of our 3-bedroom home so that construction could be completed by Baron. Every room in the house was touched, so it was crucial for us as homeowners with a young infant child to be away from the construction zone.  Eli was always very professional and accommodating to work with, as were all of the contractors that came to complete the job. The contractors from Baron were extremely hard-working and friendly, and everything was communicated in the proper chain of command. 

Overall, the project timeline took about 4 months to complete. I am happy to say that we are now living in a beautiful ""almost brand new"" 68 year old home, and are very pleased with the layout and design of our new kitchen and bathroom. The experience of remodeling a home is definitely stressful and sometimes was not fun, but the end result is night and day! Baron does good quality work, but it is always important to check on the progress of your project as the homeowner and as the customer."
5,"They are very professional & knowledgeable.. Their is some of the best work we have experienced in a long time. Issues are dealt with promptly, and customer satisfaction is clearly a priority. Highly recommended!"
5,"Baron Construction is a excellent company. We would definitely hire them again.
We had learned that there was a serious problem under the house while having electrical work done. The concrete foundations at the bottom of the pier pilings were disintegrating. 
We left voice messages with several different contractors and foundation companies that we researched online, but many did not call back. Even more did not keep appointments.
Eli Levy of Baron Construction was the exception. He made a timely appointment and arrived when scheduled. Although we had been doing research online regarding foundations, this was a fairly grey area to us. When Eli came and looked in detail under the house, he informed us the problem was bigger that we had at first thought. We only had piers on half on the house!
While talking over the work that must be done, and the age and condition of the house, we brought up the condition of the roof. Eli looked at the roof and saw the sagging areas that we pointed out. We talked about El Nino and stared talking about roof repairs. It turned out that the roof was in worse shape that it looked on the surface; in fact there was no plywood base and only 2 layers of failing shingles (one wood, the original ""roof deck"").
We negotiated an excellent price by being flexible with start and finish dates. We even ended up having Eli use one of his (excellent) crews to do major internal painting in the house!
All inspections were passed on the 1st visit with flying colors. If you need work on your house, big or small, new or old, we heartily recommend speaking to Eli Levy before signing contracts with anyone else."
5,"We first find Baron construction and remodeling on Angie's list they have highly recommended reviews. we had Mike come to our house to give us an estimate, after we reviewed 3 others, 20 minutes in to the meeting we knew that Baron Construction is the company to do our project.
Mike gave us amazing ideas as how we can enlarge our kitchen. he is the only contractor that listen to my needs for more storage space, and also the only one that came up with the solution for that at the first meeting. he also able to fit an island they gave me my dream kitchen. there price was higher then the others but its worth it.  when you meet them at the first time you will notice the difference and the professionalism. along the process i met all there crew members and it was amazing to see how they all taking pride of what they do.
The company spirit transfer to every one of the workers. they also helped us to find the wright budget for our project and make sure we are not over spending. there guys always came on time. we will use them in the near future for our bathroom remodeling project, we are recommending them to everyone and to all our friends."
5,"The Baron Construction and Remodeling demoed the entire kitchen, and remodeled all the counters and installed new cabinets. They also installed all the appliances. Ensured that the new kitchen meets all the new building codes. Baron Construction and Remodeling did a very professional job and taking our requests and suggestions into consideration. All the workers are polite and professional. The project leader, Eli Levy is very attentive and visited the job site frequently. The owner, Mike Baron also paid several visits personally. They also built a custom bench for our kitchen nook which turned out very nice.

For the downstairs bathroom, they also demoed the entire bathroom and built the shower from scratch. They did a great job on the tile for the shower. It is the most beautiful shower in the house now. 

I would recommend Baron Construction and Remodeling to my friends and other people."
5,Mike and Eli did an amazing job on our kitchen remodel and bathrooms. Very professional and took care of any issues that came up immediately.  They really support the client. The job was beautiful. No delays except in our part with our gorgeous back splash. I would highly recommend. My friends who have seen the kitchen comment on the fact that it's beautiful and looks like it should be in a designer magazine. You do get what you pay for and I would do it again!!!!
5,"I would highly recommend Baron Construction for your next project, and here's why.  We had a bedroom remodel and Josue and the Baron Construction team were very professional from Day 1.  When they came in to scope out the work, we were provided with an estimate at the same time - with an initial write up of the contract.  We also received documentation on their licenses, bond, and insurance - all on the first meeting.  Baron Construction was able to start our project a few days after we had signed the contract.  

Once the project started, the team was very conscious to cover the floors and other areas to make sure it wouldn't be impacted from the work.  They had estimated 2 weeks to complete the work and came within that timeframe.  Our bedroom remodel included replacement of ceiling (due to leak from bathroom above), check for additional leaks, texturize ceiling and paint, installation of recessed lighting, painting of walls and closet interior, replacement of carpet with new flooring, and new baseboards.

We were impressed with their commitment to the quality of their work and made sure we were happy along the way.  If you have home improvement projects in mind, I would recommend Baron Construction.  I know we'll definitely keep them in mind for our next project."
5,"First they came and give us an estimate that we really liked, we signed the contract to do the kitchen floors.
Before they started  the job I ask them to give me a price for the complete kitchen remodeling.
again we liked the price and we signed the contract (BTW they helped us with financing the job).
during the process we found out the electrical wiring needs to be replaced mike gave us very good price on that so we let them do it.
they also gave us 3D design rendering that was great, we actually could see how the kitchen will look like.. 
Roy Mike and the team where very helpful they answered all of our concerns and even when we change things around they where very understanding and helped us to make our dream come true.
we where very impressed when all city inspection pass at the first time.
we love how our kitchen came out, it looks amazing like it came out of a catalog, its like living in a mention. 
we will use Baron construction again to do our roof in the in the near future.
they did exactly what they promise and above.
we are extremely happy that we choose Baron construction and remodeling  to do our kitchen."
5,My kitchen remodel is so beautiful!  The project manager communicated effectively so were kept informed of timelines and next steps. Our designer listed to what we wanted and helped us create our dream kitchen! All of the contractors were very professional and treated my home respectively.
5,"I had an absolute blast doing my kitchen remodel with Beatris Gross. she was absolutely fantastic. Confident, professional, knowledgeable, and with a real eye for design choices, the kitchen looks even better than I would have hoped. she had a real knack for not only answering all of my questions, but taking what my wife and I wanted to do with our kitchen and making it part of the whole project. Absolutely I will be working with her again for any remodeling projects."
5,"Treeium and specifically Beatris Gross and her entire team are worth every penny. No matter the size of the project you can tell they all care about the details and doing things right the first time. I never had to wonder if this work was up to code. They are experts and artists in what they do and every single crew was respectful, skilled, and honest. We have found our contractor for every other project. We needed someone to guide us through the kitchen renovation process and we found that in Beatris. We love our new kitchen and can’t wait for future work!"
5,"Our home renovation couldn’t have been completed without the great work from Treeium. We added 400+ sq ft to our home, turning it from a 3 bed/2bath to 4 bed/2 bath, large open concept with new kitchen & dining room. Like any home reno, there were some unexpected items, but Sam & the team worked with us to prioritize what we wanted and needed. We love how everything turned out!! I highly recommend this team!"
1,"Treeium recently completed the remodel of a portion of my home and a detached garage to create two apartments (ADUs). Unfortunately, my experience was very negative and fraught with tension, disagreement, and arguments. Most importantly, the project was scheduled to be completed in 3.5 months but took over 7 months to complete, without a reasonable cause for the delay. Additionally, they repeatedly touted their years of experience and expertise, which caused me great concern when I discovered that their contract’s payment schedule forced me to pay large sums of money for work that had not been completed. On a positive note, their sales pitch and marketing are exceptional."
5,"We used Treeium for a complete new kitchen and bathroom. From the  start to the finish, we were guided along each step of the way by Beatris, the wonderful project manager, who worked on it! She was there to assist us with every single decision that we had to make! She gave us details about each product and offered excellent suggestions, and then allowed us to make the final decision. She is very knowledgeable about everything that her job entails and extremely precise with even the small details, thus assuring that the end results will be exceptional!! We loved her for that! Over the duration of the project, she also showed kindness and consideration in that she willingly made adjustments to do things at a later time of the day to suit our schedule,  and even assisted us in getting a driving cart in the stores when necessary, due to health issues! Overall, we think that Beatris went ‘above and beyond’ the requirements of her job, and we are absolutely pleased with the job done! We would definitely recommend Treeium and Beatris to everyone!!! We are so delighted to have a beautiful new kitchen and bathroom!"
5,"Treeium is awesome! Seriously, the most incredible discovery I've made. We had a complex project (2 walls, a bi-fold door, and glass) and Treeium handled it flawlessly. Several other larger companies that I contacted stated that they would be unable to come in for another week, implying that someone would be sleeping in the living room, and that their charges were significantly higher without tax. Treeium was cost effective, well-organized, and extremely efficient. Sebastian phoned back to confirm and even offered to come earlier in the day on Saturday, recognizing that work into the afternoon/evening would cause complications in our building. Sebastian and his team performed miracles in a matter of hours, and the wall beyond our expectations. We were blown away by their professionalism and friendliness, especially on such a frantic move-in day.

After the wall was done, we intended to add plexiglass to the top but were unable to do so due to a lack of materials. Sebastian contacted the next day to set a time for early Monday morning to come finish the repair and allow me to continue working later in the day. He did a wonderful job, and it gives even more privacy while maintaining the room's natural light.

Sebastian and the entire team at Treeium did an excellent job! Thank you guys!"
5,"We've had an amazing experience with Treeium. In and out in a flash with a flawless product. We've utilized them on numerous occasions for large-scale projects and they've always started and finished on schedule. After the workers departed one of the projects, I identified a minor issue that needed to be addressed. I contacted Sebastian and he answered instantly and arrived the next day to resolve the issue without charging me further fees. Impeccable service and overall great quality products."
4,Eran was friendly and professional from the beginning.  I loved the 3D design at the beginning.  It allowed us to be more specific in the material selections.  It was really a great experience working with Eran and Treeium.  And the bathroom looked even more beautiful than we imagined. I highly recommend them both for any future remodels.
5,"Treeium did everything that they promised to do and did it in less time than originally estimated.  Our Project Manager AmirTeymouri was nothing short of amazing.  He stopped by the project every day just to check in and make sure we didn't have any questions.  Not only that but he always answered my calls or texts within a few minutes...even on Saturday or after hours.  

I have heard (and had) horror stories about contractors but not the case with Treeium. I can assure you that Amir will be our only call when we are ready for the next project."
5,"There was a leak from the shower pipes that went unnoticed for months. When discovered, the damage was too extensive so we decided to bite the bullet and remodel. Treeium outperformed my expectations with the bathroom remodeling project. I had the pleasure to work with Beatris Gross, who exemplifies the meaning of customer service and delivers on her commitments. She was attentive to all of my inquiries, responding immediately. I was 400 miles away during the remodel and she kept me apprised at every single step through phone calls, texts and pictures. I appreciated her remodeling expertise and eye for detail. The workers on the remodel are masters of their crafts, not jacks of all trades. This gives me the assurance the work was done correctly. No more leaks! The project was finished within the time frame stated and I am very pleased with the result. I highly recommend Beatris.  And I would definitely work with her again."
5,"they were wonder to work with. I would recommend them without hesitation. They were professional, pleasant, and responsive. ok ok"
5,"Farid and his team from Treeium did an excellent job remodeling our bathroom. The end result was better than we imagined. Farid was responsive, completed the job on time and there weren’t any surprises in cost. We will use Farid Ghaheri and his team when we are ready to remodel our kitchen."
1,"SPENT $$$ - GOT NOWHERE!!!!  I had an awful experience with this company.  They were paid for their professional expertise to assess whether a simple balcony could be built.  Upon their assurance that it could be, I engaged upon the next phase of the project.  After several months and additional payment, they informed me that it could not be done.  Rather than taking responsibility for their error and refunding the second payment, they decided to double down and charge me more!!  UNETHICAL, UNREASONABLE, UNRELIABLE."
5,"We had a storage room off the garage converted to a studio apartment. The project managers Dorel Zander and Lior Lazrovich, their  architect, designers, and work crews were friendly and excellent at what they do.  Even with the issues that the City raised about the property and physical challenges,  they were willing to work with us, within our budget, to get the job completed within the time frame we were working with.  Dorel and Lior stayed in constant contact with us throughout the project, particularly with the stages of the remodel and the city inspections. They were always very responsive to any questions or concerns we had and addressed them fully.   The bathroom and kitchenette look terrific.  Very pleased with the overall experience."
5,The company with Avram and Eran Dukeman were very helpful in guiding us through the entire project remodeling our entire kitchen and 2 bathrooms. They were always clear about choices to be made and when changes were necessary. They also tended to spot problems before we noticed them. Good guidance all through the entire project.
2,"I would steer clear of this company.  They started my kitchen remodel August 3 and it is October 29 and it is not yet complete.  There have been 28 working days that there were no workers at the house.  The foreman never comes around nor does the project manager.    Several times the inspector came to the house and no one from Treeium was there to meet them.  I asked for my concerns to be escalated and was told management were all busy.  The communication from the project manager to the workers is horrible.  The cabinet guys had no idea we were to have toe-kick drawers or certain pull-outs.  I asked one of the workers, who is giving you direction and they indicated the direction was coming from me. I call the phone number and there is an option to select 3 to discuss concerns with a project, but when you select 3 you receive an error message and it disconnects you. The only saving grace is that the kitchen looks really nice and I am pleased with it but the process to get there was horrible!"
5,"Treeium remodeled two of our bathrooms and we couldn't be more pleased with the result. Everything was completed professionally, on time and within our budget. Dorel Zender is excellent as a project manager. He is client focused, very professional and has an excellent demeanor for working with people anxious about having work done on their home. 

We are currently using Treeium to convert a window in one of our bedrooms into a sliding glass door along with adding a deck to allow us better access to our yard. Everything has been going well.

I definitely recommend Treeium and you would be fortunate to have Dorel as your project manager."
5,"Our home was in desperate need of a remodel, it needed everything, new roof, flooring, re wire,  re plumb, four bathrooms, game room and a kitchen. Basically our home was a gut job.  I had been dreaming of a remodel for years. Needless to say we were nervous about hiring a company that could handle such a big project. After talking to numerous contractors I was becoming discouraged, no real quotes and no time lines.  Then I discovered Treeium and knew I had found a company that I could trust with a 1/2 million Dollar renovation.
Shahar Algazy has been nothing short of amazing, treating our home like his own and diligently keeping everything on time and on budget, if not Below.  Everyday since we began Shahar has had a 10 man crew on the job, practically unheard  of with most companies. When it came time to upgrade the electric panel we were faced with the possible need to destroy a large portion of  our yard and cut down a  beautiful and stately tree that is a major feature in our yard. Shahar could have left it at that but he went the extra  mile to find a better solution. Shahar saved us 30K and our beloved ficus tree.
We continue to be impressed with Treeium's customer service and communication. The Treeium portal is very easy to navigate and keeps everything clear and organized. We love the gallery that lets our friends and family keep track of the  progress. Great work Treeium and Shahar Algazy for talking such good care of our home."
5,"My wife and I were looking to completely open up our kitchen and bring into a modern aesthetic. As you can see in the pictures, we had a very cramped galley style kitchen with 80s style red oak and old appliances.  

Our project managers, Lior Lazarovich and Dorel Zander, were very easy to work with and understood what we were looking for and made sure to incorporate our needs throughout the design. They were able to remove two major walls to open up the kitchen, and their designer Natali did an amazing job of reconfiguring the cabinets to give us an ample amount of storage.

Overall, I'd highly recommend working with Treeium, and specifically with Lior and Dorel.  They were very professional, always attentive to our numerous texts and concerns even on the weekends (we were those annoying clients lol). They handled everything with an easy going nature that was straightforward and honest. We look forward to working with them again on any projects we have in the future! Thanks guys"
5,"Having never done such a major project, I was more than a little apprehensive about the timeline, but my project manager Beatris Gross made sure everything kept moving.  It took just one month from start to finish.  Everyone who worked on my kitchen was knowledgeable and professional.  Beatris spent hours helping me choose just the right materials to complete my vision for a new kitchen.  I would definitely recommend this company."
5,"Three months ago we finished our project with Treeium, successfully.
Farid & Gabriel played a fundamental role during the entire process, which included dealing with architects, engineers, city codes and builders. They both were very accommodating, patient and extremely professional.  
Our project was a major home remodel (90%). It took less than five months from the moment the plans were approved to completion.
We hired Treeium to ensure our home was built structurally safe & sound, and that’s what they delivered. Have already recommended them to several people."
5,"We recently remodeled our master bathroom.  We gutted the entire space and put in both a half bath and a full master.  We could not have been more pleased with Treeium, the contractor we worked with on this project.  We recommend them highly, and plan to have them return to do our kitchen!  Contract Treeium for all your remodeling needs.  855.833.8733 and ask for Dorel or Lior."
5,"My wife and I are retired and decided to invest in our home of 35 years in Irvine by upgrading all three bathrooms. We had remodeled them only once before and did not have much money at the time and we were determined to get it right this time.

We decided against hiring an interior designer so we interviewed contractors that were larger firms with good resources like a Project Manager that would come onsite weekly and see the project thru from beginning to end. We knew we would pay a little more for that level of service. We decided on Treeium after meeting a few times with our Project Manager Amir Teymouri.

Amir made us really comfortable with the depth of his remodel knowledge, gave us very credible  design idea’s  and excelled at both his verbal and written communications. That combined with Treeium’s size ($100M in annual sales), discounts with major suppliers of bath fixtures  and tile Were ket you decision along with the excellent ratings on Yelp, Houzz etc. So, we signed a contract for all 3 bathrooms with Amir.

Amir did exactly as he said he would by monitoring his crews work, visiting our home several times a week to check on progress, ask us about how we liked the work and communicating to us clearly as to schedule and what materials or decisions were needed (and when) from us.

Amir has terrific contacts with key suppliers like bathroom fixtures, tile stores, shower enclosures etc…. and those relationships really helped when issues would present themselves. For example, our supplier for the master bath sold us the wrong rough-in valve (which was already installed and tiled over) for the filler tube for our soaker tub. Amir handled all the conversations with the supplier and presented us with 3 different alternative replacements for the tube filler that would fit the already installed rough-in valve.
 Treeium is a very good company but as always its the people that make the difference. In my opinion Amir is a very good Project Manager and has a very good team supporting him. I would highly recommend Treeium and especially Amir Teymouri for your home remodel needs.

Bottom line, could not be happier with the final competition of all 3 bathrooms!  I was so satisfied mid-way with through the project I signed another contract to have Treeium paint the exterior of my house and they did a terrific job on that as well."
5,"Treeium is not necessarily the most cost efficient company I’d you shop around, but you certainly get what you pay for with contractors. As a company, it was very professional, the portal is great, you have licensed contractors that are insured at all times. Our process was timely, transparent and on budget which is all we can ask for. 
My review is actually in support of our project manager/contractor Amir. He went above and beyond for our project before, during and after construction. He was available for questions at all hours, gave honest feedback and worked with us to find great solutions. Our kitchen resurfacing was painless and Amir made sure it was finished to perfection down to the last detail. 

We have recommended Amir (and therefore Treeium) to several colleagues and friends and would certainly recommend him and the Treeium team to anyone looking for painless remodeling."
5,"Lior Lazarovich is an outstanding project manager. He has really looked out for me throughout the re-modal process. His daily communication was indispensable. I looked forward to the texts, they kept me apprised every step of the way. Lior Lazarovich, built trust with his strong communication and  his attention to detail. He made me feel relaxed through the process and I am very happy and excited by the results. My kitchen is everything I could have asked for.

If I ever do another re-modal I would just call Lior."
5,"We recently had a four season sunroom addition built at our house. Our project was managed by Medhi Heshmati and Amir Teymouri, and we couldn't have asked for more professional and communicative project managers. From the start, they were with us, helping us plan out our sunroom to our budget, and explaining all the steps and processes involved. They let us know the approximate timeline for start of construction, and what would be involved, and provided suggestions on best practices that would result in a highest end quality for our budget. The build team was professional and always courteous, and were very receptive and responsive to any questions and issues we had. From start to finish, the project was streamlined, and on target, and we are very satisfied with the end result. I will definitely be calling up Mehdi and Amir for future remodels, and would not hesitate to recommend them to friends and family."
5,"Thanks to Lior Lazarovich, Dorel Zander and the Treeium team for the transformation of my parents home! The timeline and communication throughout the remodel process was great! Especially with my busy schedule. All the work was very efficient and thorough. Very satisfied! Would recommend to anyone looking to remodel."
5,"Last November, I started calling around to get some quotes for remodeling my master bathroom.  I'd set a budget and wanted to plan ahead to keep the project on track.  I'd calculated that the best time for the work to begin would be February/March 2020.   Some of the contractors I called turned me down because the work wouldn't be starting immediately.  But when I called Treeium, the response couldn't have been more different.   

Right from our first meeting, project managers Shahar ""Shawn"" Algazy and Guy Borenstein listened to my wish-list, got a sense of my aesthetic, and started making suggestions to realize my vision.  Their advice about materials and 3D rendering of the design were especially reassuring for someone undertaking a remodel on this scale for the first time.

The whole process has unfolded so smoothly.   I've been kept in the loop every step of the way.   Shahar in particular has stopped by regularly to make sure everything has been going to plan.  The crew has been consistently on time, amazingly friendly and polite and very considerate in cleaning up at the end of each day.    The team effort and spirit at Treeium is truly outstanding -- everyone I've talked with has contributed to realizing this vision.  Shahar and Guy are truly amazing!  I'm extremely grateful and very happy to be part of the Treeium family.   Thoroughly recommended!"
5,"Medhi was great to work with. He answered all my questions and provided a detailed scope of work on the bid. Adjusted it multiple times to meet my needs before even signing a contract. His foreman and crew were efficient and courteous. They completed the job on ahead of schedule and passed all inspections with ease. the remodel of our bathroom was amazing, I would recommend them to anybody."
5,"A few months after our massive job was completed (new electrical, new walls, new floors, new doors, new HVAC, etc) we noticed that a couple of our barn doors were starting to stick a bit. When we reached out to Gina at Treeium, she had a crew out to us the next business day to take care of it, free of charge.

The crew was in and out and took care of the two doors without any fuss. We really appreciated that Treeium came out so quickly (and for free) in order to make sure we were fully satisfied with their work."
5,"Treeium is great to work with. Professional, knowledgeable and an overall great experience. Guy, Shahar, Eli and Maya are my team.  They have earned my trust as we are halfway through my complete remodel and addition.  I can sleep better knowing my home is in their hands."
5,"I worked with Eli at Treeium over 3 1/2 months - remodeling two bathrooms. From our first conversation to the last, Eli was a pleasure to work with and Treeium did not disappoint! Our remodeling was (IMHO) pretty extensive -- new sinks, new vanities, new toilets, new lighting, new stall shower, new floors, new tile, and so on. The only thing we didn't replace was the bathtub - because Eli recognized that it could be refinished and look like new (which it did!!). We also did some structural work (reconfiguring a closet and also changing a doorway). I had a million decisions to make in the process of selecting materials, tile, flooring, countertops, etc. -- and so I was in steady contact with Eli to make sure what I was picking out would meet code requirements and would work within the constraints of our bathrooms (e.g., making sure the stall shower wasn't too large for the space). He was always fast in responding, patient in answering my questions, and helpful in providing the necessary information. Treeium's team was also great -- from the folks who handled the loan, to the foreman of the job, to the workers who did the actual work. Everyone was friendly, competent, FAST, and professional. On many days, I was out of town and I had no hesitation leaving them a key in a lock box and letting them work without my actually being there. If they ran into a problem or a question, they contact me -- so I never had to worry that they would make a decision in my absence that I wouldn't agree with. Eli said the first bathroom would take 3 weeks and the second (master) bathroom would take 4 weeks. And he was true to his word! Even allowing for ""wasted"" days due to holidays or waiting for city inspections, the projects were complete in 7 weeks. I would definitely work with Treeium again and with Eli, in particular!"
5,"We just had two bathrooms remodeled by Treeium.  Lior, the project manager, made sure that all was on schedule -- the crews, the suppliers and us.  We are very happy with the new bathrooms in our home.

 

The contract said the job would be done in 7-8 weeks; it was done in 5 weeks.  Lior is a “taskmaster” in the best sense of the word.  He is also a cheerleader.  He kept us all “in line” by reminding us of our responsibilities. He was at the site every day.  His crew was friendly, conscientious, and efficient.

 

We live approximately seven hours drive from the construction site and had several trips planned during the reconstruction.  Prior to starting the project, we were supplied detailed schematics as well as a designer’s full color rendering of what the bathrooms would look like on completion.  As a result, we were able to follow the work via skype or photos which Lior supplied daily.  We made minor changes along the way.  Lior was always positive and gave great advice in relation to costs etc..  We were told exactly how much the project (or changes we made) would cost there were no surprises when the work was completed.   

 

We are more than happy with the work done by Treeium.  We plan to keep on using Treeium for the rest of our renovations because of the fine work done by the crews and the direction of Lior, the project manager."
5,"This was my first remodel.  I was very fortunate to find Amir of Treeium to do my master bathroom renovation.

From the very first meeting with Amir I knew this was the right fit.  He was told me about the company, showed me various jobs he was in charge of as the project manager.  He walked me through the process and made me feel confident that Treeium and Amir were right for the job.

The remodel went like clockwork and was completed ON TIME!! Amir was at the job site almost daily and was always available by text or phone, including weekends and holidays! When in doubt I relied upon his expertise and he never steered my wrong. Amir kept me informed throughout the process. He always told me at the close of work what the next day would be. I appreciated his attention to detail and his honesty.  I always felt I was in good hands.

Not only is Amir wonderful but so are his team.  They were very polite, cordial and without too much interference with my day.  They cleaned up daily and the dust was minimal due to the plastic tarp taped to adjoining rooms. I have a small dog and they were always careful to keep the front door closed so she would not escape.  

After hearing all the horror stories from others about a remodel I feel very lucky to have found Amir. He made the remodel flow easily and flawlessly. If I need any renovations in the future I will call Amir."
5,We hired Treeium to do our second story bedroom and bathroom addition. It was a big job for us and took almost 6 months. Beatris Gross was our project manager and we were so grateful for her! She ensured the work be done right and to our liking on everything. She always responded to our phone calls and texts immediately. We have small children and she was very careful to ensure the home was safe the whole time. Beatris has great taste and helped us pick beautiful finishes for our room. I highly recommend asking for her when you do your job. She was a joy to work with!
5,"Guy has been very good, very thrall with great project management and communication. He is always checking on the project and the progress, my wife Merrillyn and I have been very pleased with Guy Breuer. He is an excellent project manager. Thank you for the great experience."
5,"The company was very professional
And I trusted them above the other five that came out to give me an estimate and they were competitive"
5,"We are just finishing up a bathroom remodel with Treeium.  Etel Littman was our project manager and from the very first meeting Etel was just fantastic.  She listened to our fuzzy ideas and asked great clarifying questions to focus on what we really wanted.  This is our first remodel experience and she made it wonderful and easy.  She really walked us through the process the whole way and helped us protect ourselves from less honest contractors.  Our final inspection is tomorrow and the bathroom is just perfect.  The work quality was fabulous and the team of workers were always polite, conscientious, and hard working.  It was such a great process that I recommended Etel and Treeium to my mother who also wants to remodel her bathroom. I trust Etel to do a great job and to live up to my mother’s demands.  If you are looking to remodel your home, Treeium is just a great company."
5,"Guy Breuer is an awesome project manager for Treeium!  He is very knowledgeable, friendly, and attends to my questions in a timely manner.  He checks in frequently with me, both by phone and email, to keep me apprised of my bathroom remodel's progress.  Treeium has been a great choice for me and I highly recommend Treeium to anyone needing remodeling done!"
5,"The whole Treeium team was terrific.  Guy Breuer was the project manager.  Big kudos....on time, within scope and on budget.  Can't ask for more, except for the finished product which has had nothing but rave reviews from everyone who's seen the kitchen."
5,"Forbes magazine was right, that is all I got to say ! If you are looking to make your home more efficient , to lower your costs overall from your home, this is where you will make the final decision. Treeium was referred to me by neighbor, in Sherman Oaks, we really help each other out, to make sure our community and our homes look and live on it's best. My home was over 70 Years old, and only thing I did was change attic insulation once, no difference, Treeium came , showed me suggestions, and I ended up going with an self efficient smart home,  my living Costs from my home have dropped a drastic 35 percent in costs, I didnt think this was possible, but they made it possible, on top of that,  they went ahead and planted a tree for remodeling my home to an efficient environment friendly home,they really do care about the environment just like it mentioned in the article, I must say they deserve 10 stars not 5, thank you once again for educating me and helping my family live a better and more earth friendly life."
5,"We worked with Shahar Algazy and Maya Orlova on our kitchen, bath and wet bar remodel.  Treeium is proactive, on time, within budget and provides high quality work. Having a large team and industry network enabled them to keep the project moving forward."
5,"Treeium is an excellent company that I have been working with, but the individual that should be recognized by everyone is Etel Littman because of her fantastic customer service that continues to drive Treeium to success. I am thankful for Etel’s high quality customer service she never lets me down or anyone that I know. An example of her excellent service was her knowledge in design and ability to work efficiently with me in providing best pricing and quality material to all customers on time."
5,"We are working with Etel from Treeium. She has been a great project manager for us thus far. She has been very approachable, available, and has helped guide us in our ongoing kitchen remodel."
5,"My husband and I got bids from 7 contractors and decided to move forward with our kitchen remodel with Treeium. A few of the quotes came in at similar prices so what won us over was our project manager, Etel Littman. From the first meeting until now, communication has been clear and straightforward. She was one of the only people to educate us on how to do our homework on a contractor - together we went onto the CSLB website to compare all the companies and overall we liked what Treeium has to offer. Through the process of picking our materials, Etel has also been very flexible and accommodating, meeting us at tile stores, trying to find us the best pricing, and even dropping off samples to our home on a Sunday. Demo starts soon and I'm looking forward to the kitchen of our dreams! I feel our kitchen will be in good hands with this company and project manager."
5,"I used Guy Borenstein from Treeium for a huge project last year, I had my entire kitchen and living room remodeled and upgraded. I was extremely happy with the quality of their work and the caliber of all the workmen that Guy Borenstein has on his team.  Their work exceeded all my expectations! 
I am in the process of remodeling my back yard and bbq area and Guy Borenstein is back to the drawing board!  There is no other contractor I will work with.
Can't wait to see the end result!"
5,"The 60-year old sink in our rental property required serious work. Because they seemed to be the most sincere about fixing our problem, we hired Treeium, Inc. in Valley Village to do the work. Guy Borenstein was the Project Manager and Elizabeth Camarena was the site supervisor. Like most projects, we anticipated a certain level of anxiety until the job was complete but Guy and Elizabeth made this project virtually stress-free for us. The finished work is beautiful and, when we do further upgrades, we will consider Treeium as our first choice."
5,Treeium is an excellent company and Guy Borenstein is an amazing contractor. The company truly cares about their clients and tries their best to be respectful and accommodating during what can be a very difficult time. I have done many projects with Treeium and Guy Borenstein and I look forward to building the ADU that is our next project. I know it will be done with excellent quality given the multiple projects I have already done with Guy and Treeium!
5,"Being our first remodel, my husband and I were a bit anxious about the whole process. From the beginning, the project manager with Treeium, Etel Littman, was great! She was very informative and thoroughly explained what to expect.  Also, she provided great ideas, from the materials, colors and design. Etel was super attentive to details and she has been a pleasure to work with. We look forward to our new home!"
5,"I’ve worked with Treeium on three different projects including two bath remodels and the best thing about them is their desire to accommodate the needs and requests of the customer. They also have great post project support.  In the last project, the project managers Farid Ghaheri and Amir Teimouri were accommodating, flexible and patient. In addition, Jose Castillo who did all the work was very patient and professional. Jose does high quality work and has great attention to detail.  Treeium is a good choice because of their customer service and post project support."
5,Treeium was professional and really cared about our satisfaction through the entire process. From my initial contact they were very responsive. I started contacting different places to learn about bathroom and kitchen remodeling and decided to give Treeium a call. I was super pleased with my initial phone consultation and decided to schedule to have a field estimator out to see the projects and provide a bid. The estimator was very friendly and had a ton of knowledge in the processes and different bathroom and kitchen upgrades available. After meeting with a couple of establishments it was clear to us that Treeium was the company for our projects. The crew and project manager were absolute professionals. We are 100% satisfied and recommend Treeium to our family and friends. Thank you!
5,"I have a small project with Treeium. My project manager is Shahar Algazy. They really give me a good help to finish my project. I owned an apartment since August 2018. I hired a contractor right after I own the place, but they took my deposit and did not do anything for 6 months, which made me into a really bad situation. Then I found Treeium on Yelp. Lucky, they went in the next day after I contact them and give me a big help. My HOA is so hard to communicate. It took us a month to start the project. Shahar even went to my HOA meeting to explain how our project going to do (I have never heard that any contractor will come to the meet, especially for a small project.) Finally, we got the approval letter and start the project. Since then everything goes very smooth. Shahar come almost everyday to see how the work is going. I must mention Roy and his buddy. They do everything perfectly, even surprise the inspector. They use all good and expensive things to make sure everything they did is in a perfect shape. Then the patching guys and painting guys came in after. To be honors the patching guys and painting guys are just alright (nothing bad, I think I just spoiled). However, they still help me a lot on those small projects which belong to myself and not on the contract for free. After a month working. My apartment finally turns into what I was looking for. Shahar is a nice project manager. As a contractor he gave me a lot of suggestions from the customer side, which I believe he can make bigger money without those suggestion. To be the truth, Shahar becomes my friend instead of just a project manager. If you are looking for a contractor. Talk to Treeium and ask Shahar as your project manager. You won’t find any project manager who will pick up your phone almost 24/7 and tell you what the best option is and what the cheapest option is to achieve your goal. Also, if possible, ask Shahar to bring Roy and his buddy in, which will make sure your electric has no problem and shock the inspector because of the nice job. 
As a review, I should let them know that their painters need to improve they job. Nice people as well but can be better. Especially after I have Shahar and Roy, I feel they should be better to be called Treeium.
Thank you Treeium to help me finish my project and give me a lot of help on the small things that I planned to do myself in order to save money."
5,"Treeium is an outstanding company and I loved working with my project manager, Guy.  I live in NY and was doing a bathroom remodel in my San Diego condo long distance.  Guy's communication was excellent and he handled everything for me.  The workmanship was terrific - the bathroom is stunning.  And my sister who lives there said his crew was very polite, very neat, and very punctual.   I highly recommend Treeium, and would use them again in a heartbeat!"
5,"Treeium is an excellent, extremely professional company. They worked fast and efficiently, and created a beautiful new bathroom for us. The quality of the work is outstanding and the entire team of specialists  work together to do an outstanding job. We have now hired them to remodel our kitchen, a second bathroom, as well as other rooms in our home. We would like to thank our contractor Lior Lazarovich and his entire team for a job super well done! Thank you!"
5,"Awesome guy  and  Professional Individual. 
I wasn't aware about Knowledge and skills. Very confident in many areas and topics.  Easy and direct conversation within professional manner."
5,"Treeium has just completed our down-to-the-studs remodel of a 1977 guest bathroom.  Our initial contact was with Tomer Turjeman.  He was pleasant and informative on the telephone, arrived promptly and answered all our questions.  We then left town for two months.  When we recontacted Tomer, he arrived a couple days later and spent several hours helping us clarify how we wanted the remodeled bathroom to look.  He offered suggestions, gently guided us away from a few bad decisions, and offered resources.

Work began within the week.  We opted to select materials ourselves and were very pleased with the suppliers Tomer recommended.  He told us that if we had the materials on hand as needed (we managed to do so), it would take no more than 6 weeks, and that he would try for 4 weeks.  It actually took 18 days from start to finish. 

Each evening, Tomer texted us the plan for the next day.  Three Treeium crews did the work.  All of them arrived when stated, were careful of our possessions, were tidy as the day progressed, and cleaned up at the end of each day, which was generally mid-afternoon.  All 8 guys were pleasant, skillful, and efficient.

This was a relatively small project, but Tomer made us feel that we were his best & most important customer.  We are very pleased with the quality of the work and with our relationship with Tomer.

We found this a very positive experience and have couple more projects in mind with them."
5,"I recently had some major work done with Treeium and it came out great. We had very expensive sliding doors added to the back of our house after another contractor did a poor job. Then the recent rains caused some balcony damage. Gina and Greg were on the case a had a team resolve the problem for us. My home is in excess of $5,000,000 and I felt comfortable using Treeium."
5,"I'd like to thank the good people at Treeium, especially Gina and Greg and all the people at the Quality Assistance Department that help me out with my leaky roof. I had treeium come out two years ago to replace my whole roof, 2 years later we had a leak, even though we're out of warranty for the labor they came out and patch the roof for no charge. Gina was kind and courteous to help me with my problem, and stayed in contact with me till the issue was resolved. And Greg did everything he could to make things right. And stayed on top of things till the leak was fixed. I would recommend Treeium to anyone who needs any general construction done."
5,Amir Teymouri of Treeium is very professional and hard working.  He is doing a great job.  The work looks great.  Very efficient.
5,"I have had experience with one other ""5"" star company and all I can say is not all 5 star companies are the same on Home Advisor. Treeium is a true 5 star company-a class act, a family-like company. First it started with Liran who wrote in detail exactly what we would expect in remodeling our 1970's kitchen. As with some companies, we were not pressured. Next came Natalie, a first class interior designer who did a computer model of our new kitchen in detail. She brought samples of cabinet finishes, back splashes and paint to go with the countertops we had discussed with Liran. During demolition the crew discovered the outside kitchen wall was soaking wet. The wall board and insulation was removed and Liran was called. When our new shower was turned on, the water was running down the wall from a broken drain pipe that had been caused by another ""5"" star company when they replaced the upstairs shower and plumbing a few weeks before. I can't imagine what the damage would have been if we had waited the 3 years to remodel the kitchen as originally planned. Liran came right over to assess the situation and got the repairs done ASAP. The rest of the remodeling came together with no problems and the end result was exactly what we wanted. Unlike the other company who left as soon as the inspector signed the report, Treeium paid attention to the finishing details. All I had to do was text Liran with what I wanted done and it was taken care of; to fixing spots on the ceiling to moving a drawer in one of the cabinets, even the tiniest finishing details were taken care of. I would not hesitate to recommend Treeium and make our kitchen available for viewing by potential customers."
5,"I would like to express our gratitude of selecting Treeium as our contractor for our major remodel to our home in Laguna Beach, Ca.But, more than this, we were fortunate to have Farid Ghaheri as our general contractor. Farid's professionism, attention to details, knowledge of construction/local laws/vendors, communicating and just plain getting the job done, was superb.  Amir was excellent as well. Always available to us. 
Our Remodel was done in 3 months ! Right on Time.
We have recommend Treeium and Farid to any of the other villa owners who are planning on doing any type of remodel. And have communicated to our General Manager, to add Treeium to our community preferred contractor list. Thank You again
Steve & Diane"
5,"We've been working with Ilya Nodel and he is a gem!  We are doing an addition to our home and he is professional and friendly.  He has been patient and also reassuring during the planning stages.  He is always available to answer any questions we might have.  Everything he has told us has been accurate, we couldn't ask for better communication."
5,I hired Treeium to come out and do a bath remodel.  I ended up having them do all the flooring as well.  Guy Breuer was the Project Manager.  I liked that he always responded to my texts and questions promptly.  He met with my schedule.  Was friendly and cooperative with my needs.
5,"We are so pleased with our addition progress of a first floor master. Treeium and Guy have be outstanding. Guy has been an amazing communicator, patient, knowledgeable and caters to our needs. He has been there from the planning, to blueprints, to permits and now almost done with the build."
5,"We could not be happier with our bathroom remodel. Working with Maor (Mike) Tal, the Project Manager, was great. He was always responsive and answered every question we had. The Treeium construction crew was professional, considerate of our time and my family, and did high quality work. We have already talked to Mike about future projects and highly recommend him and his crew."
5,"I started out just getting quotes for refinishing kitchen cabinets, then it became a complete kitchen remodel . After interviewing 3 other companies I went with Treeium.  I connected with project managers Mike Tal, right from the start.  When you have strangers coming in and out of your home for 6 weeks you better like them and I did.  Every worker who came in was great.

  Thank you Mike :)"
4,"“Treeium” a good company

We recently had a bathroom remodel done in our 100 year home in Pasadena.  We went through a selection process of four potential contractors and although Treeium was not the lowest price, we liked their presentation best. We were very pleased with our decision.  Erez, the project manager, was excellent: responsive, easy to work with, and he listened to what we wanted. Treeium’s work teams, tiling (Juan) and plumbing (Marcello) in particular,  were exceptional. Also, all the work crews were very neat and cleaned the area throughly each day. The end result was a bathroom remodel better than we had hoped for and at the price we agreed to."
5,"Wow!!!!

If I am only allowed one word to describe our remodeling experience with Treeium, it would be “Wow”!! 

Disclaimer:  We are not the easiest clients to please; and we do our due diligence extensively.  My wife had prepared a page or 2 full of questions and interviewed 5-6 highly ranked/highly recommended contractors; and ranked them based on points on a spreadsheet.  Objectively, at the end of this process, Treeium came out on top.  Subjectively, we also chose Treeium, as two of the people we know had remodeled recently with Treeium and both recommended this firm.

Our project would be a pretty big project:  We want to update our kitchen and remove two load bearing walls to make our living room/dining room/kitchen into one big open space.  This meant opening   up the roof and put in two supporting beams.  Build an island in the kitchen area.  Switch the stove from one side of the kitchen to the other. Get new appliances and cabinets.  Seal off one of two fireplaces.  Build tiled deco wall where the chimney were.  Completely re-do a downstairs bathroom that has been very dilapidated.  Change a study room into a bedroom.  Wall off part of the family and make it into a storage room.   Move the entry door a few feet away to create a bigger laundry room.  Change an existing storage room into a study room.  Change the flooring on our master bedroom from carpet to tile.  Change the hard wood floor to tile for nearly the entire house.  Re pipe the old galvanized pipes to copper for water.  Re pipe the old gas pipes.  Termite treating the house.  Painting the exterior of the house and most of the interior.  Termite tenting of the whole house.  Building new wrought iron side gates and fences.  In short, 95% of our house is being remodeled.  

That being said, my review will rate Treeium based on Timing (delay), Cost, Quality, and Customer Service.

Timing:
Right from the get go, the project manager, Lior, came to our house and listened to what we wanted to do.  He suggested that we meet with his designer to go over what we want; and the designer came out with a design that really did accentuated everything we had wanted.  The permitting process followed the architectural and engineering studies, and everything went through without a hitch.  Within a few weeks after signing the contract, we were ready for the demolition process.  

At the beginning of this process, I had asked our project manager just how long this project would take.  He told me that this project should be done in 2 months.  I did not believe him when I first heard it; because I know delays are usually to be expected in any remodeling project.  Our previous remodeling done 10 years earlier with much smaller scope was completed in 4 months.  So I was skeptical when I heard that this would be done in 2 months.  The project ended up taking 2.5 months.  The extra 2 weeks were actually not Treeium’s fault; instead it was due the conditions of the house once they opened the walls, and some of the upgrades we wanted after the project had started.  So, I was quite amazed when the project ended up pretty much completed on time.  

So, wow!!

Cost:
Treeium is not the low cost leader out of the many contractors we had interviewed.  Treeium is not the most expensive either.  Its quote falls on par with most of the quotes within a few percentage points.  At the end, we did not pick Treeium because of its price quote; but purely based on how well it scored on our own ratings mentioned above, and how highly recommended they were by their former clients.

Quality of the workmanship:
Wow!!  I don’t exactly know much about construction, so obviously I can’t tell whether whatever Treeium did behind the walls (plumbing, wiring, framing) were great in quality.  I can, however, tell that the finished product, with the entertainment cabinets, the kitchen cabinets, the island, the flooring, painting, and many more, are very much high quality, with definite attention to details. The hardwares used are also top notch.  

In my previous remodeling projects, we had custom ordered cabinets from Home Depot.  These cabinets from Treeium are exponentially better, with soft closing on all of the doors.   

The scope had included installation of recessed ceiling lights for several areas.  Treeium did above and beyond that, and replaced some of my older recessed lights to LED recessed lights.  

In previous projects, the contractors were capable in doing exactly what they needed to do.  Treeium not only did what was in the scope; on many occasions, Treeium went above and beyond what were in the scope.  And, again, everything Treeium did was done well.

Customer Service:

So far, as you may tell, I am truly impressed with Treeium.  But, what really earned my “wow” review, is Treeium’s approach to customer service.  Right after the contracts are signed, Lior, the project manager starts to provide almost daily updates of where Treeium is in the process and what we need to do to get prepared (such as packing and moving out).  Once the project got started with the demolition, the project manager would keep us apprised of everything that’s going on in the house that day, and provide us with a “progress report” and what to expect next.  So, we were kept in the loop every step of the way.  

In addition, obviously with a project this size, some hiccups are to be expected, such as damages caused by the demolition/remodeling.  Those are unavoidable.  Another reason Treeium and Lior earned the “wow” from me is how quickly they respond to our concerns and how well they addressed those concerns.  At the end of the project, we had prepared a punch list of all the items that needed to be fixed due to damages from this remodeling.  Within a matter of days, they were able to fix everything on the punch list, often times to better conditions than they were before this remodeling project.  No delays, no excuses, just get them done.

Wow!!

We have moved back home for 5 days now; and every moment I am here, I look around and remember the way it was before this project, I can’t help but be amazed how quickly this whole project come together; and how satisfied I am with the final result.  

So, wow!!!  Kudos to Treeium and Kudos to Lior, our project manager; and thank you for a surprisingly pleasant experience."
5,"I had been wanting to fix my wooden floor which had been rotting away for the last 7 years due to moisture.  So I was googling home improvement companies, and had 2 companies to come n look at the rotting floor to see what they would say, how they would go about figuring out the cause of the moisture, etc. None of the sales people impressed me enough so I didn't bother to get an estimate for cost. Instead I googled for more companies n saw Treeium. Their website n reviews sounded good enough so I had Treeium send me a salesman. It turned out they actually dispatch project managers with experience: Amir and Farid.
They explained to me a thorough work process/procedure they would implement if I were to hire them  which seemed reasonable n professional. Also, it sounded very convenient for me because they had all different kinds of workers/professionals who could diagnose n fix my floor. 
A long story short, I ended up hiring them n had them not only fix my floors but some electrical lines that had been giving us headaches as well. It took over 3 weeks yet I'm glad I had Amir n Farid take care of my house project. They were prompt n quick to understand the work situation n most of all, they knew how to be sensitive to even the smallest concerns I had. No other companies I had worked with previously on other projects was able to meet such standard. (I'm not an easy person to work with/for) 
Also, I really appreciated how they came to inspect the work morning n evening daily. And I was actually impressed that they brought a portable toilet stand for the workers to use. 
Overall, I am fully satisfied with Treeium n the 2 project managers: Amir and Farid. I highly recommend this company."
5,Treeium did top quality work on our master bathroom remodel.  Even the smallest detail that we weren't satisfied with got resolved.  Amir and Farid listened to what we had in mind and offered design suggestions/options that made our bathroom turn out beautiful.  Tile shower and floor turned out great.  We love the new vanity they suggested.  A very high quality job.
5,Jesse Marquez was very helpful in my initial phone call for estimate appt. he seemed very knowledgeable kind and eager to help.
5,"Took longer than expected (4 months), partly due to several inspections that changed the rules several times. In the end Erez, our Project Manager, completed the job as promised. Thank you Treeium."
5,"Our experience with Avi Shushan has been excellent, He kept us informed in every step of the process,
Avi is very responsive and knowledgeable 
He is the most extreme personable and he made us feel very easy with everything.
We will defiantly recommend him to everyone we know."
5,"There are no words to describe the devotion and attention that we have received from Farid Ghaheri, the project manager, and his crew in the remodeling of our house.  Farid is always available and unceasingly polite, attentive and willing to offer suggestions (that are always well thought out).  His crew does superior work and we especially appreciated the work of Robert, one of the foremen, and Carlos, one of the workers.  The work was done promptly and on budget.  There were no surprises and everything was up front.  If you need any work done, hire this company and ask for Farid !"
5,"Farid Ghaheri is our project manager and I couldn't be more satisfied. He is a no pressure very easy personality. He and his crew are very respectful of my home, my dog and my family. They are there when he says they will be and finish projects on time!!! He is patient with me when I make changes. He is totaly unflappable. I have been very happy with the workmanship of the individual componants that make up my new master bath."
5,"I've hired Treeium in the past and this is my 2nd 5-star review for them, I granted the 5 stars chiefly because of our Project Manager Avihen Levanon who efficiently coordinated the difficult task of a complete remodel of my 120-year-old kitchen. The entire kitchen except for the framework was demolished from the ceiling to the floor, including an outside structure attached to the house which had covered up 2 of the original kitchen windows. The kitchen required a lot of electrical upgrading and I appreciate that Treeium adheres to the strict building codes and my kitchen is in full compliance with the city I live in. Another plus for Treeium are the different choices and fine quality of the cabinets, countertops, and flooring I was given to choose from. My kitchen was built to my wishes, I love it and what a delight having the windows restored. Also, it was completed in the time frame stated."
5,"Update - We could not be happier with our new kitchen and the experience working with Treeium.  Everyone at Treeium was extremely professional every step of the way.  Those working on site and those in the office.  Great craftsmanship, excellent communication, punctuality, attention to detail & commitment to our satisfaction.  (We were picky and asked them to tend to small details we felt weren't exactly right and they came right away and said they were committed to making us happy.)  We have worked with other companies during remodels and the experience has NOT always been positive like this.  We highly recommend!  Thank you, Treeium!


We are in the middle of a kitchen & bathroom remodel with Treeium right now and so far we couldn’t be happier.  

Our Project Manager, Guy Borenstein, made us feel like we are all part of the same passionate team on this remodel from the time we first met up until now.  GHe is responsive, makes himself available when we have questions or concerns.  He’s been willing to take the time to walk us through all the steps of our project, (even if he’s already explained it previously) and he checks in to make sure we’re happy each step of the way.  

The first plans we had for our kitchen turned out to be out of our budget, not just with Treeium but with every company we got a bid from.  Guy was able to work with us to suggest ways to cut down the budget and we arrived at a new plan that we are still extremely happy with and with a price we can afford.  

We were told by friends, family, and even by Guy that going into a remodel can feel like your entire home has been turned into a dirty construction site, but we have been very surprised and impressed to find that Treeium is very clean and professional throughout the entire process so far.  They have used floor protection and sectioned off areas of our home from floor to ceiling while they are working, which has kept nearly all of the dust out of the other rooms, then what has surprised us the most, is that when they leave in the afternoon, they remove all plastic and floor protection so we feel completely at home (and clean) until the next morning when they lay down all the floor protection, and section off areas with plastic again - We feel it really shows that they’re going the extra mile so we don’t feel like we’re living in a construction zone.  

All the actual work completed so far has been extremely high quality, on time, and on budget. Everyone working in our home are polite and professional.  Everyone has been willing to explain to us exactly what they are doing, why, how long it will take, etc.  

When the crew demo’d our old kitchen we found some issues in the walls that needed addressing.  (not treeium’s fault).  Treeium was able to rework the schedule to accommodate the new steps required to address those issues.  

So far we’ve only had a single pice of wood that was cracked in the process of the remodel.  They immediately offered to replace it.  


So far 5 star rating for sure!"
1,"This remodel was the WORST experience ever.  We have a very large bathroom and we were quoted $50K and told that it would take 8 weeks but it took over 8 mths.  At the beginning of this project we felt so much pressure to buy a long list of things they needed so that the project wasn’t delayed.  How were we suppose to do that when all we had was a layout and no measurements? Some of the delay with this project was due to the city inspector but ultimately their contractors were fixing errors or redoing things that weren’t done right.  The first thing we were told is that a portion of a load bearing wall would need to be moved.  They sent me the change order and said that it would cost $7,000.  The first thing I asked is what is the $7,000 for?  I was told not to worry that I’d receive a detailed receipt.  What they sent me was vague and didn’t detail anything.  I never should’ve signed that change order without the detailed breakdown in my hands first.  So they used Simpson Strong-Tie hardware which is great but we told them that my husband and I work for Simpson and that we could provide the hardware that was needed.  They claim they were never told this.  I complained and was told that Treeium didn’t buy any product from Simpson.  This might be true if they already had the parts they needed but that doesn’t mean that those costs didn’t trickle down to us.  Another thing that was added to the change order was replacement of the subfloor in the shower.  We had already done the demo for the shower and it was clear when they saw the project that the subfloor would need to be replaced so to add this to the change order is ridiculous.  They replaced clear block tile with a window in the shower but the window was too big thus half of it was in the shower and half out.  They replaced the window but unfortunately the finish didn’t match the other large window that they installed over the tub so they had to replace it yet again.  We noticed the supply line for the toilet was about 10” away from the toilet so it was an eye sore.  I asked them about it and they said, “That is what the inspector advised us to do and we can’t change it.”   I called the inspector the next day and he said, “I don’t have a change order but I have no problem if you want it moved.”   One concern before even starting the project was whether the exterior stucco/paint would match where they put in the windows.  They told us that they paint the whole wall so there’s no worry about a paint match.  Well because that wasn’t written in the contract they claim that they never told us that.  The tub grout started to fail within the first week and we ended up with 6 extra boxes of floor tile.  They did credit our bill for the extra floor tile.  When I tried to use the tub the first time there was a problem with the water pressure.  They ultimately fixed that but when I tried to use the shower the first time there was no cold water so it was scalding hot.  Apparently there was a part in the valve that was broken or that they broke.  A replacement part was bought and they still couldn’t get it to work.  The 2nd Project Mgr (I was told the first one no longer worked there) called me and told me it wasn’t working and asked if he could go buy another shower valve similar to the one we bought.  I said, “That is fine but we won’t accept a cheap replacement”.  He assured me it would be good quality.  I got home to find that they had to remove two of the tiles from the shower (which I knew nothing about) but the part they bought was a cheap $100 replacement and what we bought was almost $300 so we were not happy.  They installed the plumbing for the vanity before the vanity even arrived which meant that the installation was difficult.  According to the contractors doing the work they told us, “You guys bought the wrong size vanity”.”  No one ever told us what size vanity to buy.  The problem was that they put the plumbing in before they even knew what we purchased.  They cut sloppy holes in the shelves of the vanity to accommodate the plumbing and have since fixed this by making new shelves but I’ve lost most of my space on the bottom shelf.  The silicone they put around the toilet came off after about 7-10 days and they grouted around the tub when that should’ve really been silicone.  They ultimately did install silicone around the tub but they also put it in the shower.  We never asked for silicone in the shower and it looks sloppy.  They also countersunk the tub and that wasn’t how it was designed to be installed.  We had an existing pocket door that just needed a new latch on it which they installed but now it’s off track and scratching the paint on both sides.  The only thing they are good at is reminding customers that a payment is due. I would not recommend Treeium to my worst enemy!"
5,"We found Treeium through Houzz. Salesman and Project Manager Avi Shushan was at our house a couple of days later, where he helped us put our remodel ideas together. This was our first remodel, and we were not sure what to expect. We had heard that contractors worked sporadically - but the Treeium experience was continuous. Avi always gave us a heads up on the schedule.  We had pleasant, skilled crews working on our home every day for a month. Avi also has a helpful designer's eye if you are doing your own design work and need a nudge. The stamped concrete guys are artists, as are the tile and paint guys. The results are gorgeous."
5,Guy gave us a bid we could live with.  The contract was clear and through the whole project was exactly as the contract stated.  Payments were easy to make online.  Guy was easy to work with and listened.  The work was done on time.  Antonio cleaned up every night.  Could not be happier with my new kitchen.  Best construction experience ever.
5,"Thank you Lior Lazarovich for a very professional job well done. 
  Lior was always available to us too answer all our requests and questions . Great job Lior, we wish you the best."
5,"Treeium and my project manager, Guy Breuer, really delivered on my bathroom remodel.  They were the 3rd quote I received and I found the fairest of all.  The project came in within scope, on time (actually a little ahead of schedule) and on budget.  Don't forget to include them in your project plan!!"
5,"We met with Erez to discuss our bathroom remodel project. He was very personable, knowledgeable and professional. After interviewing other companies we decided to go with Treeium and were very glad we did.
Erez and his crew did a great job. The bathroom looks awesome. The work was completed on time and the workmanship was top notch.
Would definitely recommend to our family and friends."
5,"Farid is spectacular.
He exceeded my expectations!
He is professional, artistic, punctual, dependable, timely and realistic.
He treats small projects with same respect and professionalism as a big project.
I know because we started off a tiny project but expanded it and are still so very thrilled.
I highly recommend him!! We are already planning phase 2!!!"
5,"We're in the process of doing a room addition to our new house, and recently signed with Treeium. Farid Ghaheri is managing the project and we can't praise him highly enough. From the very first meeting, he's been professional, articulate, and punctual -- most of the time he's early (very important to us, with our tight schedules!). Farid walked us through the entire process and timeline, and was always honest and realistic with his recommendations and estimates. Treeium in general has been wonderful to work with for several reasons: 1) their user-friendly and transparent online portal; 2) set cost; 3) versatility with adding to the scope of work; 4) their economy of scale, with several crews and professionals available to do whatever needs to be done, when it needs to be done. We discussed budget with Farid very early on, and by the time we got to the contract and detailed scope of work, the price he gave us was right in the initial range he quoted us. One of the best things about how Farid works is that he always has examples of recent or ongoing projects to illustrate his ideas; he's a wizard with his iPhone and laptop. Farid is extremely responsive to texts, emails, and calls, and always impresses us with how frequently he's available to swing by our home to discuss an idea or to check on someone's work. You're in good hands with Treeium, and especially with Farid."
5,Thank you for the initial information on how you work.  The video is also helpful. I look forward to getting a proposal.
5,"So far the kitchen is looking good.Daniel is very positive, friendly, and personable. We would recommend Treeium to others, they have a great quality assurance representative Darrell."
5,"Spoke with Nina who was very helpful and professional in answering a few of my questions and making me feel that working with Treeium could be a good fit for us. 
I look forward to our initial appointment next week to find out more. Thank you Nina"
5,Lisa was very pleasant to speak to. She was my first exposure to Treeium and gave me enough confidence in the company that I setup the initial appointment.
4,"Treeium and Itay, the Project Manager, were very good.  They came on time, fallowed all of my directions, came back promptly if I thought something else needed to be done, and completed the project within a decent period of time.  I would recommend them for bathroom remodels.  The cost was reasonable for the job done."
5,"We needed to remodel our 2 bedroom condo in Culver City and needed it done quickly because we were paying for two mortgages at the same time. Erez Shifferman came and after chatting for a few minutes with my wife and me he immediately understood our ideas and concerns and provided many helpful suggestions on how to save time and money with our project. Not only is he knowledgeable about all aspects of remodeling, but is also honest and upfront with all the costs. Some contractors might give you a low estimate at the beginning and surprise you with extra charges down the road, but this is never the case with Erez and Treeium because they are such a reputable and old company and they have an ironclad reputation to defend!"
5,"Amazing company to work with.
The crew is honest, reliable and professional.

The are prompt and always available if you need them.

I highly recommend Treeium."
5,"the workmanship is excellent.  all of the men were on the job on time, finished job in a timely manner--as promised.  house looks great.  so good i have just hired treeium to do another job for me, bigger than first.  i trust them to care for my home as i do.  farid, the project manager has integrity.  he looks out for me and my home as if it were his own.  he arrives for appointments when he says he will.  i couldn't be happier with the whole experience. i will use them again and again.  thank you, treeium team."
5,"I ordered a 308sqft aluminum patio cover to reduce the sun exposure on my back bedroom. Not only does the cover look great, but how things progressed was impressive. 
1. I was given an up front price that was in line with competitors. I chose them due to other good reviews they have had.
2. The project was timed and well managed by Erez, who coordinated the permit, the materials purchase and the installation. 
3. The installation passed inspection the first time and was well done. Built per plan. 

Overall this was was a very pleasant and efficient engagement of an impeccable business. I highly recommend Treeium."
5,"We just started working with Treeium in the preliminary phase and so far so good! They are extremely professional and timely. My husband and I just started the process, and, in the meantime, we won a $200 Amazon gift card by completing a survey for them! We were so excited! Adriana Villasenor and Don Mkhitarian hand delivered the gift card to our home and were super sweet and helpful. It’s safe to say we are looking forward to working with them and our project manager Don Mkhitarian!"
5,"Sam Deen and his crew did an excellent job in remodeling our master bathroom.  Everyone was very courteous, on time, cleaned the site daily and respected our work days and hours.  They made my dream bathroom come true."
5,"We recently had a bathroom remodel done by Treeium and were very happy with their work and especially with our project manager, Farid.  Their workers showed up on time, worked diligently on the project, and cleaned up each day when they were done.  Farid was on site every day to make certain the work was progressing, and he was also a huge help with the design details and in making sure everything was done to our liking.  The job was completed professionally and on time and looks great!  We would definitely give 5 stars to Farid and Treeium."
5,"Always a scary proposition trusting in a construction/remodeling company, but we really lucked out with Treeium. Initially contacted by Guy Breuer, who was to be the project manager on our master bath remodel. He gave us a quote that was far less than 2 other contractors and promised the work would be completed in 4 weeks. He lied. It was done in just under 3 weeks!! 
Guy was very helpful in recommending tile and bathroom fixture companies in the area and we found exactly what we were looking for (thanks Russ at Modello Tile). What I really think made all the difference was the crew that we had for our project. Shout out to Miguel, Liverado and the rest of Juan's crew, true craftsmen. Clean, efficient and showed up every day until completion.
Truly an amazing and easy experience. I strongly suggest at least making Treeium one of your quotes."
5,"Ashley was very professional, reviewing my remodeling needs and scheduling a project estimator to meet with me.  Selection will be based on proposal."
5,"The Irvine team, headed by Farid are so professional. I appreciate all the workers from the demo team to the tile men to the plumbers. They are polite, personable, receptive to questions and input, clean up when they are done and very good at what they do. You will not regret hiring this team. Kara"
5,Tomer is remarkably reliable and responsive.  He conducted himself and subcontractors in an effiicent and professional manner.   We will be using Treeium and Tomer again soon.
5,"After interviewing several contractors, for a kitchen remodel, we awarded the contract to Treeium, and I am glad we did.

From the onset, they were professional, clean, neat, reliable, and the end result is an amazing kitchen that we love.

Our Project manager was Assaf Labi.  He and his team of experts came in measured drew and gave us a quote.  From start to finish Assaf coordinated everything.  We talked to him on a daily basis.  He texted to make sure all was clean when the crew left for the evening.

I was amazed that even during the demolition phase, there was no dust in adjoining rooms.  They had the place sealed tight.

The quality of our cabinets is outstanding and the workmanship for installation if perfect. Their designer came up with different ideas.  We kept making changes until we were happy.  She knew her stuff.

I highly recommend Treeium for any remodel you want to do.  They are a reliable company.  With all the nightmares you hear about contractors, we did not experience any problems."
5,"I first met Guy Borenstein and then he became like a brother figure.  He came, inspected, gave an estimate, brought the crew, and did the job on time and as per their estimate.  I definitely recommend him and Treeium for any renovation or upgrade you need around your house."
5,"When I decided to remodel/enlarge my bathroom and build new closets, I wasn't sure I'd find someone who can build exactly what I wanted, especially since we had to deal with HOA rules and CCRs 
Erez Schifferman ruled over the job and dealt with all the hiccups that always happen when remodeling and construction is done, in a very professional and friendly way. I'm not sure I would've survived this without him being on top of all of it. Oh and I'm quite surprised that he survived my complaining during the last 3 months"
5,"I’m so over joyed with the experience we have had with Erez Schifferman!  He hasn’t represented this company with outstanding professionalism, patience, and motivation.  We had a terrible experience with a different company so we were very nervous about dealing with contractors once again but Erez has made sure that all our questions have been answered and had reassured through the project!  We’re almost done with our project and are overly pleased!"
5,We had our front and backyard re landscaped with drought tolerant plants and materials. Erez Shifferman was responsive to every request we had to make our yard perfect. When there were questions /problems ( as there are with all construction projects ) Erez was available immediately  and addressed every one in a timely and in a more than satisfactory manner. I would recommend Erez Shifferman and Treeium for any and all of your home remodel needs.
5,"We hired Treeium to remodel our master bathroom. Guy Borenstein was very easy to work with and followed through with us every step of the way. The crews were professional, did good work were friendly and always cleaned up after each job. Our remodel was done in a timely manner and we are very pleased."
5,"So far Treeium and our head contractor, Guy Borenstein, have done an amazing job on our open concept kitchen remodel. And we are not easy customers! We had load bearing walls removed, beams placed within the ceiling, concrete footings poured under the house, our hardwood floors seamlessly matched to run from the living room into the kitchen, drywall on the walls and ceiling is perfectly flat, and all has gone smoothly. Meanwhile we are still living in the house so they sealed off the rest of the house with zipper entry doorways, and the dreaded dust that we were so afraid of has been kept to a minimum. They are even sticking to their budget and timeline. I’ve been warned these days that is not to be expected! We should know because we have experienced the worst with other contractors.  So I feel the need to shout off the mountain tops how awesome these guys are. We can’t wait to see the finished product!"
5,"We just had our house remodel completed by Treeium and we couldn’t be happier.  We started with the kitchen demolition which honestly made my wife cry.  But the kitchen that was built in its place is like a dream come true.  Our Project Manager, Lior Lazarovich took our old tired kitchen and gave us a new house.  I can’t believe this is the same house we lived in for 7 years.  I’m truly blown away by the quality of their work.  5 Stars all the way.  Thanks again Lior Lazarovich and Treeium."
5,"One of the greatest experiences I has while remodeling my home. Great company, great customer service and workmanship. I was very impressed by the professionalism of my project manager, he managed my project which was a gate replacement and a kitchen remodel in a very timely matter. I'm very happy with my decision and would highly recommend this company to my friends."
5,"There were some problems and delays.  However, they promised to complete all punch list items by December 11, 2017.  It is extremely satisfying to receive clear commitments from Treeium!"
4,"I don't think any contractor is perfect and deserves 5 stars since there is always room for improvement.  But, we are very happy with Treeium's work and the results of our project.

We completed our house remodel with Treeium in April 2017.  It was an extensive project requiring us to move out of the house for 8 months.  We added a bathroom, shifted the location of our kitchen, completely rebuilt an old addition with new vaulted ceilings, upgraded all the electrical, new HVAC, and tankless water heater.

We found Treeium on Home Advisor and selected them for these reasons:
1.  They are a local company, which made communication/meetings very easy.
2.  We liked the idea that they did not sub out their workers.  The same foreman, Mika, and his crew of 5-6 guys were here throughout the entire project, with additional specialty contractors such as electrical, tile layer, HVAC installer.
3.  The salesperson, Guy Borenstein, was very good-natured and we thought he would be an easy person to work with.  Turned out to be true.
4.  They could also take care of the engineering plans and we would not have to hire a separate engineer/architect.
5.  They state that the customer will not incur additional costs above the initial bid for contractor mistakes or misjudgments.  This was absolutely true.

While I don’t think that any construction projects are perfect and without stress, we were generally pleased with Treeium for their work ethic and attention to customer expectation.  They were very efficient during the work schedule and we were consistently updated with the progress.  Any mistakes/errors (which are inevitable) were quickly taken care of.  We are truly enjoying our newly remodeled home and have referred Treeium to several of our friends interested in remodeling their homes.

Our biggest complaints would be the following: (1) they were sometimes insensitive to our schedules (asking us to immediately run out and purchase items needed for the house); (2) the communication between various workers/crew was sometimes lacking; (3) more time and attention could have been paid to drywall finishing; and, (4) the crew could have done a better job maintaining our existing landscape (we are still digging concrete pieces and construction debris out of our lawns).  Fairly small issues considering the scope of our project.

Overall, I would recommend Treeium for your house project.  Compared to the nightmare stories I have heard about other contractors, Treeium is a reliable company and genuinely tries their best for the customer."
5,"FANTASTIC AND FOLLOW UP!  I highly recommend Treeium.
We used Treeium to renovate our kitchen.  I got bids from 6 different companies and Treeium was neither the least nor the most expensive.  But, Ron was able to show photos of previous work and also seemed the most sincere.  We needed to have the kitchen finished in 5 weeks as we wanted it done before we moved into the house.  Ron and his team finished the job on time and within the budget.  
They've come over several times to make the smallest of adjustments for me.  As a matter of fact, 4 months after the job, the kitchen faucet was loose and Ron sent someone to fix it and at no charge.
We plan on renovating our baths soon and Ron and Treeium will be the first team we call."
5,"We had an entire house remodeled and worked with PG Mr Ron Amondy and Mr Allan Nagar. They and their crews were professional, punctual and responsible the whole time. The quote was also closed to the actual cost at the end. We were happy  and satisfied with their service and will highly recommend them to anyone who need a remodel service."
5,"Assaf was my project manager. He did an outstanding job. My kitchen and bathroom were totally gutted and remodeled. He is experienced, knowledgeable, supportive, and well organized. He kept constant communication with me throughout the construction process which I appreciated. Assaf provided me with guidance when it was time to choose appliances, sinks, flooring, countertops, etc. 

I have a high end kitchen now that functions to meet my needs. My bathroom looks elegant. What a difference!
Yvonne"
5,"We had a master bathroom redone. Eli was tremendous as both a person and as a project manager. The work was all excellent and the process smooth. All details were thoroughly discussed and changes requested along the way were accommodated graciously.
All of the workers were pleasant and courteous. Definitely a recommendation from us!"
5,"Yay! I’m finally done with my project and I want to extend my sincere gratitude to Erez Shifferman & Treeium. Erez, you brought trust back to my realm of working with contractors, thank you so much for everything you’ve done for me! I interviewed Erez as a part of cautiously trying to commit to executing a general remodel that I was thinking of for a long time, and I immediately connected with him. I knew right then and there that I would work well with him because you definitely want to feel comfortable and communicate well with the person who is going to be in charge of your once in a life time remodeling project. In my opinion, this is true to any scale project, not necessarily an involved and longer one. 
Erez was able to show me his company profile, all of their contractors licenses and paperwork. This put my mind at ease and I decided to go with Treeium. Now, when the project is completed , I’m happy to say that the quality of the workmanship and attention to detail blow me away. I am very pleased with all of the work done. Erez was always available by text or phone call, and he spent a lot of time helping me make decisions and going over options. I never felt rushed or that my needs were not met.
The entire process went smoothly despite the fact that my daughter and I lived in the home the entire time. I even have two inside dogs and they always made sure to keep their water bowl full and put them outside and clean up when needed. Every room was transformed beautifully. It looks like a new home! Actually, the project took longer than expected because I ended up adding more and more to the original scope of work after I saw how smooth, worry free and well handled the process has been. I figured I might as well get it all done and finish my dream list. Communication was key for me throughout the process, and Erez masters that very well, regardless to what time the clock reads. Bottom line, I was very well served with nothing but professionalism, great quality of workmanship, communication  and honesty. Thank you again Erez & Treeium for a very well done job! I highly recommend Treeium and Erez for your home and all of your contracting needs. You won’t be disappointed!"
5,Treeium demolished our combination bathtub/shower in order to install a walk-in shower with a sliding door to accommodate my 84-year-old father who moved in with us. The shower is aesthetically very attractive and works well to meet my Dad's needs. The workmen were courteous and the project manager Erez was on top of the project and communicated well with us every step of the way.
5,"Treeium remodeled our kitchen and it came out beautifully. We found Treeium through Home Advisor. I wanted to remodel the old kitchen we had because I continuously kept getting splinters. So we remodeled with Treeium and our kitchen is simply amazing. Very impressed with the precision of the cabs & countertops. They made sure everything is sealed. If Treeium would make a mistake, they graciously corrected the concern. Very professional, hard working company. Communication could have been better between labor workers. Overall the experience was great. Benjamin was the best project manager. He kept in touch with us, and addressed all of our concerns. Very punctual and communication with him was great. I definitely will consider working with Benjamin & Treeium again!"
5,"One word:   Excellent.  The renovation was completed with ease AND ahead of schedule.  The cost was relative to the renovation.  The project manager, Liran Avital, was extremely valuable.  He was at my disposal at any hour including, but not limited to 11:30 p.m., when I could respond to various forms of communication.  Mr. Avital took very good care of my investment.  His foreman, Caesar, and his crew were extremely tidy, diligent, meticulous and patient in every aspect of the renovation.  If Caesar had a question about the design, he asked and fully understood sometimes vague instructions.  The designer, Natalie, did a fabulous job on suggesting the appropriate backsplash, cabinetry and appropriate handles.  The kitchen cabinets are self-closing with a spice rack and lazy Susan contained therein.  Treeium was an excellent choice."
5,"Treeium provided us with excellent, tasteful kitchen and bathroom remodelIng within our budget.  Our condo is now stylish and ready for rental!  Prior to contacting Treeium, we had gone through the estimation process with two big box companies, which we decided not to use because of their ""out-of-a can"" offerings and dishonest estimation practices.  From telephone reception to oversight to the finishing touches, Treeium was professional, expeditious and friendly in their dealings.  Project Manager Guy Breuer warmly walked us through the entire process, explaining what sorts of things might be discovered that would affect the scope of work, and therefore cost.  He and his team of excellent contractors not only carried out the work, but also made important aesthetic suggestions based on their experience.  We are very happy we went with them and would not hesitate to contact Treeium again for any remodeling work!"
5,My experience with Treeium was great. My project manager was Lior Lazarovich and he was great . I will most likely choose Treeium for future renovations. I have no complaints for Lior. He did an amazing job assisting my needs and addressed all my concerns.
4,My name is Ben. I had my sons fiancé's kitchen remodeled and I have to say everything went ok. I had to leave town for a weekend and project manager Lior was amazing at managing their renovation. I had left specific instructions to install a delicate vintage style stove to their kitchen as a wedding gift. Everything went great! And they're very happy and satisfied with the remodel.
5,"Treeium and Erez Shifferman our project manager were amazing! We’ve suffered through way too many hot summers in our own home until we just couldn’t take it anymore. We met with several companies in the process of trying to wrap our heads around costs and different solutions for our needs. Erez stood out from the crowd right from the get-go with professionalism, communication, honesty and overall good vibe. We were very impressed with his expertise, knowledge and how he carried himself overall. Erez kept in touch with us after our initial meeting and made us feel very comfortable towards the next meeting we lined up with him to go over specifics of the project and get everything going. Erez delivered everything he promised and I simply can’t believe how smooth our project was handled considering all the elements of the project, which included removal of a giant 50ft tall tree, re-insulating our attic including 2 attic exhaust fans, re-painting our entire house, installing brand new AC units in all the bedrooms and the cherry on the icing - 3,500sf of beautiful energy efficient drought tolerant landscaping that completely transformed our front and back yards from desert like no man’s land to beautifully designed yards we’re now proud of! We want to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to Erez, we’re truly blown away by the service and attention we received from him, we simply can’t imagine the process being any smoother or worries free than what it was. Now that the project is completed, we’re happy to contribute our review to the list of reviews Erez is so proud of, we now know he works very hard towards making his customers happy and satisfied so the least we can do is share our story with others - if you’re reading this review and thinking to work with Treeium, do yourself a favor and ask to meet with Erez, he’s a needle in a haystack!"
5,"We remodeled a second bathroom.  Complete gut job, changing bathtub to shower removing a soffit.  The project manager was Lior, who was excellent at communicating with us as the project progressed.  We are very happy with the result!"
5,"Erez Shifferman was our project coordinator. We moved out of state while the work was being done. Erez was great and very easy to work with remotely - he kept in touch regularly, also often sending photos of progress. He handled purchasing of items, so that we didn't have to worry about that. He gave us confidence that Treeium was doing good work while we were many miles away, and made it a stress-free experience for us.

After the work was done, we made a quick trip back to see it in-person. We were very satisfied with the overall quality of work by Treeium."
5,"When great work is combined with exceptional service the results is always fun.

The project is almost completed. A few minor changes need to be done; However Treeium did an excellent job. Took their time to bring the most out of the work and made adjustments as 

Based on the overall craftsmanship and the quality of each character, Gustavo (cab installer) Roy (electrician), Jaime (the painter) and Phillip (the tile man) need a raise. 

It is a pleasant home owner experience. Strongly recommend Treeium to do your remodel. They stand as a professional contractor because it is critical for increasing the value of your home. The RIGHT way

Have a great day.

Victor Lesley"
5,"The last thing that you want to be told when you move into your new home is that you have mold and that they will need to test, isolate, rip out, and reconstruct the affected area. When that reality set in within a week or so after we had moved in, we were heartbroken. While it hurt, we knew that we needed to take care of the issue immediately. When we hired Treeium to perform the work, we were very impressed by Farid’s knowledge and experience. His explanation of the situation and what steps were needed to remediate were thorough and complete. Farid maintained proper communication throughout the entire project and the Treeium staff who performed the work were incredibly professional and skilled. We thank Treeium for making our home safe and healthy."
5,"I had Treeium remove my old HVAC and replace it with a new one. My project manager was Tomer Turjeman. He was truly fantastic to work with. He was very helpful in helping decide on the best approach for the install and was very diligent in following up with the details. On top of that, he was a great conversationalist and was very respectful and friendly with my mother (who is staying with me for a bit). She was at the house during the project and really enjoyed talking with Tomer. She commented many times on how great Tomer and the rest of the Treeium team were. Tomer is the primary reason for my 5-star rating.

The work was completed with high quality and the new HVAC works very well. This is the first summer at the house where we were able to keep it consistently cool. We're very pleased with it. My only point of critical feedback is that Treeium is on the higher end pricing-wise and I would have liked to see a more transparent breakdown of the job costs.  I did not decrease my rating for this, however, because it was ultimately my decision to move forward and the job came in exactly at the agreed upon cost.

Excellent work, Tomer and team! We're very pleased."
5,"I had the pleasure of dealing with Guy Borenstein in working on a
proposal that fit my budget and he did everything he possibly could to meet that criteria and I was satisfied with the final proposal. He is so honest and real and I truly appreciated that. Unfortunately for Treeium, I decided to sell my condo ""as is."" I love trees and I love the fact the Treeium plants a tree at the completion of each renovation. Wish I could have been part of that. I highly recommend Guy Borenstein in particular at Treeium and their spectacular work (as you'll see on their website). I could not have had a more pleasant experience."
5,"After several difficult attempts with other contractors for our kitchen remodel, we finally landed on Treeium, and the fantastic Project Manager Oshrat. She was very attentive, honest, and responsive. She addressed every question or concern I had along the way and completed to job in a timely manner. The project was only a partial kitchen remodel (new quartz counters, marble backsplash, new sink and faucet), but we were always treated us like a big-ticket customer. We went into the project with a firm budget and only had one surprise with some electrical work that needed to be done. Oshrat was always mindful of our budget and even with the extra expense we still ended up under budget. Allen and Marvin did a lot of the work for our project and did a great job. I tend to be a perfectionist and notice all the little things. Every time I pointed something out they were always quick to fix it. Even a few weeks after the project was completed, I found a few small things that were not to my liking. I texted Oshrat, and she was ontop of it and said they would fix anything that was not to my liking. I would recommend Treeium in a heartbeat!!"
5,"I have partnered with Treeium to acquire more clients with larger design projects. 
The team is very innovative, creative and thorough and I look forward to working with  them for their professionalism and follow up."
5,"Erez is the best! If you’re thinking to hire Treeium for your home remodeling project and you were lucky enough to meet with Erez, let me save you some reading time - all the other reviews Erez has online are 100% accurate and truly describe this fine young man. Now, when the project is completed, I am very pleased to add my own review! We hired Treeium and Erez to replace our roof after meeting with a few companies, but not feeling as comfortable with them both on the personal and professional side. Since we had a bad experience with a different contractor in the past, we were very picky and selective this time around.. Erez took his time with ease when he met with us (twice!) and explained everything thoroughly. After we awarded Erez the project, first thing he said to me was “now it’s time for me to start proving myself to you”, and this is exactly what Erez has done throughout the project. We passed all inspections on the first shot and now we can comfortably leave for our vacation as we were able to meet a very tight schedule for completing our project. Thank you Erez so much for delivering everything you promised and as well for a well done job!"
5,"I would highly recommend working with Guy Breuer from Treeium, Inc for any of your future home improvement projects. My wife and I had the pleasure of his help and services this past year on the construction of our addition. Guy was very helpful, easy to communicate with, and transparent with the project. He and his crew were very efficient and thorough when it came to executing each part of the job. They were all very respectful and friendly as well. I am happy to say that Guy and Treeium help to build a safe home for my family.

James, Alameda CA"
5,Talked to 2 contractors  and felt like they weren't listening to me.. I knew my budget and I knew what I wanted..  Was ready to just save my hard earned money and give up my dream addition util I met the 3rd  contractor Guy Breuer with Treeium.. He's not a sales rep he's a Project Manager and he gave me common sense options not UP SELLING options i didn't need..  I had a real good feeling about Guy and what he said Treeium would deliver . So I signed on the dotted line and now i have  my dream room addition.. He met all times lines and his work crew's were top notch.. Thanks Guy..
5,"My wife and I selected Treeium to paint the interior of our home and it was a great experience.  Guy Portal explained all of our options and was patient and understanding as we selected our color choices.  His staff performed flawlessly, completing the job on time and leaving our home clean and looking beautiful.  We wouldn't hesitate to consider Treeium again for future projects.

Steve M"
5,"Treeium was amazing! I was referred to them by a close friend that did a bunch of work on her place after a major water leak. She loved them and said they are very fast, have fair prices and are easy to communicate with.

I had a water leak in my tentants unit. I explained to them that my tenants wanted to get back in their home ASAP. They were constantly doing whatever they could to make things go faster. They said my project would be completed in about 8 days or so. They finished it in about 5 instead. Everything looks great! They went the extra mile and helped us find the best matching materials, they were easy to communicate with and answered every text and call within minutes. That is definitely not the case with most contractors. They under-promised and overdelivered on everything! Erez, The Project Manager, was amazing! He is very personable, went out of his way to help in any way he could. After this project, I honestly feel like I have a new personal friend. I would not hesitate to hire them again!"
5,"Liran Avital and the Treeium crew completed a full kitchen and bathroom remodel for us, and we are thrilled with the results! We have had some nightmarish experiences in the past so we were reluctant to take this project. After contacting Treeium  and meeting with Liran in person, he gave us all the confidence we needed, we interviewed 2 other companies before and after we met Liran and let me tell you this, no one were even close to the professionalism and the well established reputation Treeium have and the way Liran went through every aspect of the project with us. so we decided to move forward with Treeium and so glad we did! From the start, Liran patiently worked with us to draw up the plans, scope of work, budget and timeline. His expertise and suggestions made all the difference in ensuring we made the most out of the space we have. Liran was on site overseeing his crew for flawless execution. He lent his expertise in helping me select final touches like drawer pulls, kitchen faucets and lighting and bathroom layout and design. The crew was very  polite, nice and clean throughout the whole time of the remodeling. Every day I received emails or phone calls updating me what was happening, who was coming and going, when payments were due etc. I felt completely looped in and reassured at the overall coordination of all the people involved, everything Liran had promised he delivered! This is a top notch company and Liran was a fantastic project manager and was very easy to work with . The project was completed on time. Liran is honest, detail oriented and very professional. Thank you Liran and the Treeium crew for my new kitchen and bathroom. It was a pleasure to work with you. We highly recommend Liran Avital  and Treeium crew for smooth, peaceful remodeling process and quality work for everyone who is thinking to remodel his house!"
5,I hired Treeium for my remodeling project and couldn’t be happier with my decision. I had a wonderful experience with the company and my project manager Guy Borestein. He was always available for me throughout the entire process. He gave us an excellent customer service. Out project turned out great. Once again thank you Treeium for a job well done.
1,"We worked with Guy who is very personable, but the job that needed to be done took well over the time we were told  I understand that there are complications when doing a complex design, but the communication was horrible and took well over 6 months!   

We were very clear in our expectations and when it came to the build we didn't actually hire Treeium.  Their bid was more than $100K over what we were bid by other companies.  They tried to work with us and give us discounts, but in the end we went with another contractor.  

This is where things were very frustrating.  We were told the plans would be complete and ready to build.  There were issues with the plans that the contractor had to modify (simple measurements and walls where there couldn't be).  These small issues my contractor was able to work with the inspectors but the biggest issue was the retaining walls below our build.  They didn't put them where needed, nor tall enough and when we called them back to fix the problem, we were billed almost $1000 to fix!  We are still fighting them to not pay for this bill.  Instead of responding to us and fixing the problem they say we should expect changes!    I can see if we changed the plans  - but this was a blatant mistake by the engineer and we should NOT be billed because they did the plans wrong in the first place - DISAPPOINTING to say the least!  :("
5,"Up to this point am very happy with the work performed,Erez was there answering my questions and concerns,thank you"
5,"I’ve known Erez Shifferman for years now but I’ve never had the need to work with him professionally for any of the construction services he offers. When I learned Erez offers energy efficient upgrades as an energy upgrade California contractor and after discussing some ideas, I felt very comfortable with letting Erez perform the upgrades to my home. Needless to say, Erez made the experience flawless and super smooth even when I was out of state for the majority part of the work. Erez is one of those people you immediately feel like you can trust, as he’s a straight shooter, professional, personable and honest. My energy efficient upgrades are making a huge difference to my home and I’m very content with the work performed. Thank you Erez for making this happen for me and I’m happy we could do business together!"
5,"I acquired several bids to remodel my home and was very pleased to have contracted with Treeium, Inc.  My projects varied in expertise from building a second story wrap around deck, replacement of custom skylights, redoing the concrete driveway and other varied projects to bring my older home up to date.  Dotan, the Project Manager, was professional, knowledgeable, organized, and made time to make sure I was updated on all facets of the project, including communicating with me outside of business hours.  Furthermore, the Treemium team was pleasant, courteous and respectful of my property.  I would recommend them to anyone who is considering remodeling their home and would hire Treeium, Inc. again."
5,"Excellent job was done by Treeium & their crew. After looking around for over 3 months for a good contractor, I was finally referred to Treeium. Their project manager was friendly, knowledgeable, professional and most of all honest!! Absolutely no pressure tactics which made me feel comfortable with him. We decided to go with them to remodel our kitchen & do some landscaping in the backyard. They installed artificial turf and water-conversant plants and now my backyard looks beautiful. My kitchen was really old, needed everything updated. They gave me new cabinets, countertops, tile, and lighting. It literally looks like a new house and my friends are always astonished when they come over. 

I want to personally thank Treeium for the help and making this whole process easy. You took care of absolutely everything and your entire crew was very nice and polite the whole time. Don't know what I would've done without you. I'll definitely recommend treeium to everyone!"
5,"I found Treeium and hired them for a full high-end remodel of an existing 2,600 SF home in Playa del Rey, which was an investment/flip. They were well-priced, fair, very experienced and their workmanship was exceptional. They have multiple offices and a large staff, which was comforting to know going into the job. Guy Barnea and Ron Admony both acted as the PM's and they were fantastic. They were easily accessible throughout the entire process and the only change orders we had on the job were for scope that I decided to add at my own discretion. Would definitely use again."
5,"I did a complete remodel of a mobile home in Camarillo Springs (where you own the land), with Treeium. They did an amazing job and the service and quality were all amazing. They took everything down to the studs and built a home that you would NEVER know now is a mobile home. Ari and Guy were amazing and took care of everything from beginning to end! 
I highly recommend them!
Doris S."
5,"I was refereed to Treeium by a friend of mine because he had heard the horror stories I've had with other contractors in the past. He told me they were professional, reliable, and high quality..and wow he was right! Best remodeling experience I've ever had. We did a complete new roof for our home and it came out beautiful. All the workers were very friendly, and I was constantly kept updated as the project was progressing. I strongly recommend Treeium and will for sure be using them again."
4,"After waiting approximately 12 to 13 years to make a decision to semi-remodel our 1947 kitchen, we found ourselves hunting for the right company to perform high quality work for us in a timely fashion. We interviewed approximately 6 to 7 companies and we decided to award the contract Treeuim to do the work.  Our project manager is Guy Bornstein and I can't say enough about his enthusiasm and professionalism! He represents his company well, and while we are in week two of our remodel so far most everything is going well and I can't wait to update our friends & family when everything is finished!"
5,"Guy Borenstein is the guy you want leading your project!!!!! I can't say enough about him and his crew. An absolute professional. Everything was done within the time frame he gave us and was done with the highest standards. My new kitchen looks amazing. His crew was very nice, polite, and worked so hard to get the job done. Guy was always in contact with updates on the remodel and there at anytime to answer any questions I had. His ideas really made a difference in the way the kitchen came together. His knowledge and vision made working with him so easy. The kitchen is now the place where we spend all our time. Couldn't be happier. We plan on doing more work to the house later and I wouldn't call anyone else."
5,"Treeium Inc was hired to replace my problematic flat roof and the job was very well done. We passed both inspections first strike and overall we're very satisfied. So much can be said about a roof job other than it looks good, but definitely plenty can be said about the project manager behind the scene who made it all happen, Erez Shifferman. I've been around for a while to know that Erez is a rarity in the construction industry. His integrity, communication skills and attention to details are something to take pride in, and his company should know about it. Erez brings to the table everything he promises and it is obvious he cares about what he does, how he does it and who he does it for. I'm not sure how many project managers Treeium employes, but if half of them are carved from the same material Erez is carved it is crystal clear to me how Treeium was able to be featured in magazines such Inc 500 and Forbes. It's all about the individuals behind the scene…. All the power to you guys!"
5,"I was looking to have my windows and slider door replaced. I interviewed a few different companies and then met with Treeium's representatives, Rose Chang and Neev Kugel. They were very professional from start to finish. My biggest challenge was finances and Rose and Neev were able to assist me by setting me up with the HERO program. They were extremely honest and explained everything to me before we proceeded forward with our agreement. Throughout the whole process they kept me updated regarding everything that was happening and about to happen. They were onsite to supervise and keep the project on schedule. I was so pleased with the service that I decided to have them do my exterior paint of the house. It was overall a wonderful experience and I would strongly recommend Rose and Neev and the Treeium team for anyone considering with a quality company. Thank you Rose and Neev!!!"
5,"We hired Treeium for partial renovation of our house which included remodeling of the bathrooms, replacement carpet with hardwood floor and porcelain tiles, painting walls, ceiling, windows (inside and outside), doors and some cabinets, and replacement and installation of new fans, lights, switches, circuits, plumbing, and air-conditioner duct covers. One of the challenges was that we did not move our furniture and boxed staff out of the house, and the team kept moving all those around and disassembled and reassembled furniture as it was necessary. We even managed to stay at home for the first two-three weeks of the renovation. In agreement with Treeium, we chose the option to select and buy vanities, air-jet bath tub, faucets, and such materials as floor wood and tiles by ourselves. Shower glass-doors, LED lights, and miscellaneous parts and materials were provided by Treeium. 
Project manager, Lior Lazarovich, leaded the team very professionally, friendly, and flexible. He tried to satisfy all our requests. He was in touch with us on a daily basis, or more often when it was necessary.  In his messages, he updated us every evening. Seeing the high quality of the team work, we asked to add to the project some extra work that we initially did not considered.  Lior explained all our possibilities and helped make the proper choices.  We have never experienced any push from him.  Despite of the additional work, the project was completed in time. The team worked on Saturdays and sometimes on Sundays. We also thank Carlos Escrobar for high quality and optimal solutions.  Thank you, guys, very much!
Half-year later we are still very satisfied with the work done by Treeium.  All neighbors, friends, and other visitors to our house, who had seen the house before the renovation, are usually impressed and comments positively. Some told us that we are lucky to find such a company. All renovated entities still look nice and work properly. The only necessary replacement was a malfunctioned LED light, which Treeium quickly replaced without any charges after my single call to Lior.  We want to thank Lior again for his fine work and customer oriented attitude, and Treeium management for organizing such a good company."
5,"We hired Treeium for whole house renovation. We just bought this old condo, and nothing had been updated at least 15 years. Our project manager was MIKE, he is very responsible, whatever or whenever we needed to talk to him, he responded quickly. Even a little problem, he took care of it immediately. And his team, they're all awesome! They work hard, and make sure everything works and looks great. I honestly some of other contractors might do their work cheaper, but comes to the quality of work, can't beat Treeium. Now our condo came back to life and looks like a new one. Thanks to MIKE and his team!"
5,"Treeium provided & installed beautiful energy efficient windows and a sliding door in our home and we couldn't be happier over all.  Erez Shifferman who worked with us as the manager for the project is an honest, professional and extremely easy to work & communicate with. The service he gave us was superb and we can't imagine being treated any better. I already have a few family members lined up to check out my beautiful new windows and sliding door, so we hope to refer more business to Erez and Treeium in the near future!"
5,"I hired Treeium, Inc to take care of my leaky deck and planters after having water damage due to bad original design and construction of the deck/planters. The project manager who met with me (and later on was responsible for my project) was Erez Shifferman. As opposed to another company that offered a partial fix to remedy the problem, Erez suggested a different approach of redoing the deck entirely to make sure we're not just masking the problem but actually taking care of it from the root. Although the price point was higher than the other company (for the obvious reason that the solution/scope of work suggested by Erez was much more involved), I felt that this would optimally be the better approach for my piece of mind. Overall and throughout the project, Erez kept me involved on a daily basis with pictures and updates and made me feel at ease that I was being taken care of. Erez made sure to keep superb fluent communication with me and I can honestly say that my experience with Treeium as a company and Erez as the project manager who ran my project was flawless, smooth and stress free. It was very noticeable that Erez genuinely went the extra mile for me and you can tell he's just that type of a professional person who would do the same for all of his clients. I was really impressed as well with their headquarters office and operation when I came in to sign the paperwork, you can definitely tell that they're a top notch company that takes great pride in their customer service and quality of work. No more working with shady companies that operate from PO boxes...
I am 100% satisfied with the service and quality of workmanship I was provided with, and would definitely recommend Erez & Treeium to whoever I know who might be in need of any construction service. Thanks guys!"
5,"I hired Treeium Inc. for my much needed energy efficient upgrades around the house which included a complete replacement of my roof and windows. The project manager who worked with me was Erez Shifferman, a true professional, easy going, friendly and caring person whom I knew was going to take care of me and my project from the first time we sat by the table. Sure enough, I was right. My project was ran seamlessly, smoothly and with no glitches whatsoever which is a rarity in the construction world. I can already tell how much of an impact my new roof and windows are having on the temperature and comfort inside my home. Thank you Erez for delivering everything you promised, I will be more than happy to refer you to anyone I know who might be able to benefit from your outstanding service."
5,"Treeium to the rescue!!  I had the BEST Project Manager Lior Lazarovich.  He was patient, kind and very quick to respond to my calls.  Lior and his crew came in to start My Complete Kitchen Remodel on January 9th.  Along with the Kitchen remodel on January 11th Treeium replaced Two Sliding Glass Doors and Three Windows!!!  All these guys were no nonsense take care of business workers.  Everything was done fast, clean & efficient! I was simply amazed at how everything was planned out like clock work (Boom, Boom, Boom).  The organization that Lior maintained with his crew and keeping my sanity in check throughout all this activity was BRILLIANT!!  My finished project was realized on February 8th. My dream has come true!!!  I would definitely call Treeium again for another project without hesitation!!"
5,"We were looking to have a Solar system installed on our home as our electric bills started to escalate drastically over the years. We interviewed a few companies to have this project done including Treeium. Treeium sent out their Solar Specialist, Mr. Neev Kugel, to assess our needs and discuss the effects and benefits of going Solar. Upon meeting Neev, we felt very comfortable with him and immediately noticed that he was far more knowledgeable regarding Solar than any other representative we had met before. He explained everything to us, he let us know ahead of time that we will need to upgrade our main electrical panel as a part of the Solar installation (something that no other representative had mentioned before) and he told us exactly what we should expect throughout each stage of this project. 
Later on, we were even more satisfied and confident in our decision of choosing Treeium and Neev as they found out that we had an open permit with our county for a patio project we took on in the past. The permit was never finalized and had we not met Neev on time, we would have paid a heavy fee to the county for not dealing with this properly. 
Neev assisted us with taking care of this, he took care of the Solar and electrical panel installation, and made sure to visit the project often to make sure everything was done according to his standards. 
It was a really great experience working with Neev and the Treeium team on this project. We were definitely impressed by the professionalism and the integrity that both Treeium and Neev held.
We recommend Treeium to anyone considering a home remodeling project and we strongly recommend that you ask specifically for Neev should the company allow. You won’t regret it. Thank you Neev and Treeium for all that you have done for us."
5,My overall experience with Treeium and Guy Breuer was fantastic. They made me feel at ease with peace of mind though out the duration of the kitchen remodel by letting me know what they were doing or going to do at the end of everyday they were here. I felt very comfortable and trust Guy Breuer and his team with my home when I leave the house to go shopping for Christmas gifts. The kitchen remodel was completed a little over 3 weeks just in time for my birthday on Christmas. I would recommend Treeium and Guy Breuer and his team if you’re considering getting a kitchen remodel.
5,"It was time for us to go through a roof replacement, and being something we never plan to do again, we were very picky in selecting the contractor who will do the job for us. When we met and talked to Erez Shifferman with Treeium, he immediately ""stood out from the crowd"" with his friendly personality, high energy, good vibe and real world professionalism. Erez is a true asset to his company, you could really tell he cares for his customers, loves what he does and takes pride in who he does it for. Erez explained to us in detail the process of replacing our roof, he stood up to his word and provided everything he promised. We certainly had an excellent experience with Treeium as a company and Erez as an individual, and we will definitely recommend him to anyone we know who might need any construction services. A+++ all the way!"
5,My second project with Treeium was exterior painting for my house. It turned out excellent the colors were great. The work on the trim was very precise. Don the project manager was thoroughly professional & always on time. We are very happy with the work.
5,"Treeium did work on my home for my windows, air conditioning and some roof work. The project manager they assigned to me was Avihen Levanon and he was great. Everything was explained thoroughly and my family and I are very satisfied with the finished work. We didn't really have any issues come up which was surprising due to horror stories we've heard with some other remodeling companies. I definitely recommend Treeium to anyone looking to do work on their home"
5,"I was in the market for a complete bathroom remodel and a small bathroom upgrade. I checked out a few companies and after careful consideration decided on Treeium. After meeting with Raz, I was so impressed with his knowledge and professionalism that had no problem in making my decision to have them do the work. The workers have been efficient and have been meeting their deadlines. We're actually ahead of schedule, which makes me very happy. I would definitely recommend their services for any home renovations."
5,"My husband and I wanted to add living space to our living room. I found Treeium on line and read their reviews.  I was impressed with the information. Treeium has it's in-house engineering and architectural department which helped us to obtain the blue print and the permit for the construction.  Our project manager, Don, has communicated through-out the planning process and has done a great job keeping us updated on the progress. I'm very excited to get our project started. 
     Our project is now completed and I can't tell you how wonderful it has turned out to be.  I wanted the wall moved out to give 230 sq. ft. of extra living space.  Everything I envisioned  from the day we started the planning process and by the end of the complete the results were higher than my expectations.  My neighbors have watch the progress and are awaiting to come over to experience the completed addition that has completely change my living room, with a bay window looking out into the patio/back yard.  
       Don, project manger, communicated throughout the entire project on the daily duties, worked closely with his foremen to insure great workmanship, quality assurance and he takes a lot of pictures. I recommend Treeium as a qualified contractor/re-modeler.  Make sure to ask for Don, the big Russian Armenian gentleman.  We love our remodel."
5,"Beyond satisfied with the work Treeium did with our new windows instalation for my home.
They got the work done fast , very friendly and welcoming team.
Erez has an amazing energy, and great personality. He explained to detail the process for us to qualify to get our windows changed. Any question we had , he was able to answer and get us out of dought. I recomend treeium they did an amzing job and are looking out to help home owners improve their homes"
5,"I was looking to upgrade my master bathroom as it was pretty old. I met with a few companies and decided to hire Treeium mainly because of their reputation and the professionalism of the project manager they sent over, Neev Kugel. He was very knowledgeable and managed to discuss everything in detail: scope of work, timelines, pricing, etc. I have never gone through a process like this before and Neev was able to simply break it down in a way that didn’t leave any room for questions. I was extremely impressed by his attention to details and little did I know how this would play a major factor throughout the remodel itself. He was on top of the project at all times and made sure I was always aware of what was going on in my house. When we met, Neev prepared me that this project would take anywhere between three weeks to a month. Imagine my surprise when the whole remodel was done and over with in two and a half weeks! I was so pleasantly surprised that I decided to hire Neev and the Treeium team to also take care of my Kitchen. I met with the Treeium designer and similarly to the bathroom job, the Kitchen was completed in a timely fashion and the end result came out beautiful!
To whomever is reading this review, don’t waste your time by looking anywhere else. I strongly recommend Treeium and specifically Neev Kugel to take care of any of your remodeling needs. They did an amazing job for me and I know that I will hire them again in the future! Thank you Treeium and a special thanks to you Neev for making this process so easy for me and for delivering on everything you had promised!"
5,"We had a great experience with Treeium. We had a larger island built in the kitchen of our new home. They did a great job matching the material to the existing finish and they deliver it within the promised time frame. Erez Shifferman was our project manager. He is very personable guy and understood our needs from day one. Erez work hard to ensure that everything was not less than perfect and always kept us informed about how everything was progressing. The project involved the demolition of our old island, fabrication of a costume island, electrical work, and installation. 
I highly recommend this company and we will definitely be using them for other projects we have in mind."
5,"We had a leak in our 2nd bathroom. I saw that Treeium had great reviews. We reached out to them and we were contacted by one of their Project Managers, Lior Lazarovich. We decided to replace our bathtub with a shower and replaced the toilet, vanity and flooring. We agreed on contract terms and Lior called their tile & flooring partner to make an appointment so that we had access to Treeium pricing. Our entire remodel was seamless from beginning to end. But what made our experience exceptional was having Lior as our Project Manager. He communicated next steps to us on a daily basis. We always knew where we were in the process. Lior also had a Supervisor, Gady onsite to oversee the crew. Gady was also communicating next steps. And if you have never installed a shower, there are many steps. We passed inspection with no issues because Doing things right is a priority for Lior. Lior has great passion for his work and this shines through in everything he does. We are looking forward to remodeling our master bath in the future. Our first call will be to Lior. We highly recommend him & his team! Laurie & Mike from Irvine."
5,I had a smell in my basement and my friends advised me that it may be mold. I went on home advisor and Treeium was the first company that showed up. The representative was Don Mkhitarian. He was very knowledgeable about the field and helped us with a mold test. The test results came back positive. I appreciated the fact that Don communicated with us through out the process and he explained the different types of mold that we had and the health hazard that each were responsible for.  We are very happy to take action with Treeium and looking forward for Don To help us with the remediation process. I recommend Treeium to all home owners.
5,"Was referred to Guy Borenstein by a friend who had a similar project done and was happy with the work. He has been responsive, work began on time and the workers have been clean and prompt. Completely renovating a bathroom from the studs out, so far all has gone as promised and on schedule."
5,"I was looking to increase the energy efficiency of my house as it was poorly insulated. I called a few companies and decided to hire Treeium to conduct an energy audit for me to better understand what I can do to improve my home. Upon receiving the energy audit results, I met with Treeium’s project managers Neev Kugel and Avihen Levanon to go over the scope of work involved with the energy audit results. I was so impressed with their knowledge, demeanor, and the fact that I didn’t feel pressured to do anything, that I decided to go ahead and hire them to do the work for me which included: wall and attic insulation, exterior paint, main electrical panel upgrade and replacing my windows. Neev and Avihen made sure to always keep me posted regarding the project’s progress, they were very quick to handle any issues which came up, and overall were extremely professional and efficient in making sure everything ran like clockwork. I was so impressed with their work that I decided to also hire them to take care of my front yard and install drought tolerant landscape for me, and I must say that it came out BEAUTIFUL!
Thank you Neev and Avihen for your continued care and service throughout this project. It was a pleasure working with you and I would strongly recommend Neev, Avihen and Treeium to whomever is considering going through their next remodel!"
5,Erez Shifferman and the Treeium team have been a pleasure to work with.  Their professionalism and attention to detail make any project easy. We are looking forward to working with Erez again in the near future.
5,"Not realizing that windows would drastically help in our duplex's curb appeal, Erez Shifferman, our project manager suggested we consider the offer after explaining all the benefits of having new energy efficient windows installed. After much deliberation and Erez explaining to us the payment plan, we decided to give it a go. Erez was very attentive every step of the way, from explaining the paperwork to setting up an installation appointment that worked with our schedule. The windows installers were very handy and worked with all the clutter we had at the moment. The installation was swift and they accommodated last minute changes we made with the window plans. We instantly saw the difference and are happy with the work that they did. Would recommend to others, especially Erez our project manager, who after our installation came to make sure the job was well done and finish off any paperwork and any lingering questions we may have had. Thanks Erez!"
5,"Kelley here.
Guy Borenstein Was my contractor . He was recommended by a family member.  I got three estimates in this price range . Guy had the best price , but more he had knowledge and suggestions and facts that the others had not offered ! I felt that it would be a more professional job. The master bath is gorgeous and well constructed . We gutted it and the team with Maya , Lyle , Moses and Micha and the painter are all experts . They took me shopping and it was a group effort . They were patient with my artistic side .Thanks ."
5,"As a homeowner I usually don’t speak to people who knock on my door and offer services, but on that one day a young man, Erez Shifferman, knocked on my door with a smile and said they were working in my neighborhood (which they were). He introduced me to their company and what they were doing. Overall, Erez just made it easy for me to talk to him. I was badly in need of a new roof and decided to give it a try. After reviewing his company’s good history I decided to go with Treeium. 

I felt my service was excellent, the customer service and attention I received from Erez were really second to none. Throughout the project I felt as if I was Erez's only customer and his only running project, but I know I was not! I’m very happy with the service I was given and the new roof I have. I already referred Treeium and Erez to a few acquaintances and I will recommend them to anyone who needs work at their home. The project was efficiently completed on time and the results are excellent. Thank you Erez and Treeium!"
5,"It's a rare thing to find a company that offers top quality workmanship, excellent speed at getting the work done – and competitive pricing. Treeium has delivered on all of the above… and more! Our project manager, Erez Shifferman and his team have worked magic on my 62 year-old, ranch-style home. After initially stressing over the thought of hiring and coordinating 5 or 6 individual contractors for a long overdue remodel/renovation, we met with Erez – who presented my wife and I with an inclusive, energy-efficient plan to replace our cedar shingled roof, old wood windows and original wood siding with all-new eco-friendly products.

Erez was always either available on-site or by cell – and ALWAYS responsive to calls or texts throughout the day or eve (a perpetual fear of mine, after hearing various accounts of contractor-caused renovations-gone-wrong from friends and colleagues) to discuss project scheduling and milestones, or to address any personal concerns. From the demo stage to the final stucco applications, Erez would always check in with his team, then touch base with me with project progress and updates. Throughout the process, as I’m sure many homeowners are guilty of, my wife and I made personal adjustments to our project vision – to which Erez was equally gracious and accommodating. Among the many other favorable impressions made by team Treeium was the punctuality and the positive attitude of the crew – and if you happen to live in the SoCal region, be sure to request the ‘3 Georges’. IMHO, these guys bent over backwards to make our home remodel a pleasurable experience!

Our project is nearly done, the new exterior now looks practically brand new – and I couldn't be happier. Personally, I found Erez's professionalism to be truly extraordinary. He followed through on everything he represented – making sure everything was not just acceptable – but perfectly to my liking. In sum, I would recommend Treeium to anyone who wants their home to shine!"
5,"My wife and were planning on hiring a contractor that would help us with vinyl fence installation for our backyard. We had a few estimates already and wanted to get our third one as recommended. Our third appointment was set with Treeium. Treeium is a nationally ranked full remodeler that has all the licenses necessary to complete any home renovation project and is currently ranked 30th out of the Top 500 qualified remodelers Nationwide and that was the reason we contacted Treeium. We were very Pleased with the Project Manager Don Mkhitarian that came to see us. He was very Knowledgeable about every aspect of the job. He took his time to measure every detail as well as contact the Manager of the Vinyl fence department at Treeium ""Jack"" and review all the details that would be entailed  in the installation process. We thought Don was very Honest and Genuine with us. My wife and I are retired and we had a set budget for the project, but after the meeting with Don, we both realized that the Job entails more than what we thought. We thank Don for his input and Professionalism and we are going to restrategize our budget and hopefully have Don help us with the project at a later time."
5,Guy Kritshtein was our project manager and was terrific!  He was very personable and knowledgeable. Guy was always just a phone call away.  The remodeling of our kitchen and bathroom was completed without problems.  They are a real eco home remodeling company.  I will be using this company again when I redo the backyard.
5,"Five star rating!  My experience working with the Treeium Team, generally, and Project Manager, Eli Gerloy, specifically, was fantastic.  Eli oversaw a complicated kitchen/living area/bathroom remodel project at our home.  Eli provided us with a comprehensive plan and associated quote for the project and ensured that the our budget was maintained, despite a couple of plan modifications along the way.  Eli and his team were all very knowledgeable and responsive.  I highly recommend Treeium and will work with them again down-the-road.  If you choose to do so, ask for Eli - he will take care of you."
5,"Not realizing that windows would drastically help in our duplex's curb appeal, Erez Shifferman, our project manager insisted we consider the offer. After much deliberation and Erez explaining to us the payment plan, we decided to give it a go. Erez was very attentive every step of the way, from explaining the paperwork to setting up an installation appointment that worked with our schedule. The people contracted to do the window installation were very handy and worked with all the the clutter that we had at the moment.

Would recommend to others, especially, Erez, our project manager. Who after our installation, came to make sure the job was well done and finish off any paperwork and any lingering questions we may have had. Thanks Erez!"
5,"I've contracted three projects with Treeium, with Liran Avital as the project manager.  The first and most ambitious was a bathroom renovation.  I did my own design for the bathroom, which ended up being more work for Liran and his crew than he was originally expecting. But even with the increased scope, he stuck to his original bid, and he got the project done within the time estimate.  The project turned out great; the bathroom is beautiful!  And I was really impressed with everone on his crew - just the right mix of professional and friendly, and proud of their craft (especially the guys who did our tile work!)  I'm not going to pretend everything was perfect - there were a few minor delays that could have been avoided, and on one of the smaller projects, a miscommunication about one of the materials used.  But weighing everything, Liran definitely earned a five-star review!"
5,"I interviewed quite a few companies to remodel my bathroom and upgrade my kitchen, when Don and Tomir came to give me a quote I was immediately impressed. From the beginning of the process I felt confident that I had hired the right team and I felt secure with Robert and his guys being in my home when I wasn't able to be there. Don and Tomir were always in contact with me and gave me a schedule so I would always know what was going to happen the next day, or in that week. 
I am very happy with the quality of the work and I know that if I ever have an issue with any of the work that has been done, I can text Don and Tomir and they will take care of me. I appreciate the attention and support I have had the whole project. Most importantly... I love my new bathroom and kitchen!!"
5,"I am very pleased with Treeium. My main contact was Guy Breuer who was very congenial and informative from the beginning. Guy originally set me up with Danny, who became my architect and worked with me to develop the plans for my addition. We added a garage, a bathroom, an extra room, and extended the front room. Danny took care of everything with the county and I only had to go to the county office once. The plans came out just the way I had foreseen. 

The cost was a little more than I wanted to pay but it was well worth it. From foundation to roof and everything in between supplies were top grade and so was the workmanship. I am very grateful for our foreman Angel, he and his crew worked every day, some weeks including Sundays to get my project done. And to top it all he and Guy kept me informed of their progress and what to expect the following week. 

Originally I was told that it would take 3 to 4 months, which was accurate since they finished in a little over 3 months and that was with a few delays caused by the rain.

I have received nothing but compliments from my neighbors and even random people passing by. Thank you Treeium."
5,"We were looking an energy efficient remodel that included air conditioning, new lighting, insulation and window replacement, a new electrical panel and were also considering solar. We turned to Treeium because we needed a contractor that was eligible to work under California's P.A.C.E. program (we went with Ygrene for financing), and could cover the full scope of services. My main points of contact were Neev Kugel and Ofer Dub. I found them to be both very responsive to our needs and schedule and pragmatic in their approach. The scope grew to include a rewire based on needs dictated by living in an old house, though they also recommended to wait for solar before understanding the new energy dynamics post-improvements, which insured the investment was going to the most needed items. Everything was seamless between Treeium and Ygrene. They went the extra mile to make sure we were satisfied with the work. Highly recommended."
5,"I am very pleased with the job Treeium construction and the help of the project manager Liran Avital did on my home.  The project included stone flooring, carpet, all new cabinetry and countertops.  My home looks amazing, because the meticulous work by this company and the expertise of Liran who made recommendations had the project move along quickly and oversaw work as it was being done."
5,From start to finish Treeium has made our visions a reality.. Equipped with highly trained professionals within the home renovation business they provided great service and products.
4,"We had a significant remodel on a house we just bought - some would say it was a ""gut"" job. I don't think a single room remained untouched and we even deliberately moved retaining walls and had to fortify in other areas as a result. Treeium came in very competitively priced and provided some legit references ultimately winning the business. The work done was solid and Ron Admony - who was our project manager - in particular should be singled out. He was on site frequently to supervise the progress, and made himself available practically 24/7 via phone or text. In many cases as addenda popped up he would work with us to keep the spend in line. Definitely ask for Ron on your project when you call them!"
5,"I would like to share my story, about my experience I had with Treeium.

I contacted Treeium to replace my soak in tub with a shower.
I have a medical issue with both of my knees and I am having a difficult time entering my tub. I am a retired veteran and have been doing physical labor throughout my life which causes my knees to ache. 

Guy Borenstein from Treeium came in to give me a bid on the project. Guy listened to my needs and advised me on what my opinion were. Guy's price was more than my budget which I can afford (I have not done any construction work for over a decade, I just couldn't afford it). And was not aware of construction prices in today's market.

I told Guy that I cannot afford to do the work at this time.
I could sence Guy wanted to help in any way he can, and he did smile emoticon

Guy asked if he could step out for a few min to speak to his office.After a few min Guy came in and explained to me about a program were Treeium gives back to the Community and there is a possibility that I could qualify to have my bathroom remodel done at no charge, and YES FREE!


We filled out the application and within a few weeks I found out that Treeum is going to sponsor my poroject and I will be receiving a new bathroom remodel at no charge . I never won anything in my life and can't believe this was happing to me.Within 3-4 weeks my bathroom was completed and it came out better then I ever dreamed of.

I want to thank Treeium and Guy Borenstein for making my life ""change for better""

 Sincerely,
 Allan and Terri Hewett"
5,"I love my new fireplace tile! I found Treeium on Home Advisor and from start to finish the experience was great. These guys are the real deal. I felt very secure that I was dealing with a legitimate company who has been in OC for many years (and who has tons of great reviews!) I love that they have in-house contractors for whatever job you need and don't hire sub-subtractors to get the work done. Both Don (Project Manager) and Robert (Tile Contractor) were amazing. Don kept in touch throughout the project and Robert went above and beyond to make sure the project was perfect. He also kept the workspace clean which was a bonus. Overall, thrilled with the results and LOVE THIS COMPANY! I will definitely call them again for my next project."
5,"A few months ago, my husband and I had Treeium remodel our Master Bathroom. Our Project Manager was Neev Kugel and he was absolutely phenomenal to work with. We couldn't be happier. So recently we decided to do a total remodel on our stairs too, so of course we called Neev at Treeium. Once again, he was excellent to work with. Our stairs were done beautifully and as always the customer service and quality of work were all at the highest level. Just like our Master Bathroom remodel, our Project Manager Neev Kugel was always on top of the project from start to finish. We have received so many compliments on our new stairs. Thank you Treeium, and even more specifically, thank you Neev!"
5,"We are very pleased with our new bathroom! Liran Avital was the project manager and he listened well to our description of what we wanted in the remodel. Each step of the project was carefully planned and carried out, and the finished room meets all our goals and expectations!

4,"My name is James Peery. I hired Treeium for a bathroom remodel. I went on Home Advisors and was given the name of three contractors. The only one who called me was Treeium. 

I was contacted by project manager Don. He showed up on time, was very interested in my needs, and gave me a quote. I found Don to be knowledgeable, polite, and most of all he was not ""pushy"" about me signing with Treeium. Don also made it a point to come by the project weekly to check progress.

I also dealt with Devon who works in client complaints and quality control. I found Devon to be a breath of fresh air who took care of all the issues I wanted addressed. Devon even called me on her day off to keep me up to date on the resolution of my issues. I wasn't having quality issues as much as I was frustrated with the length of the project and some other minor issues. Devon treated all my issues as if they were major and she was always pleasant. 

I also dealt with the field quality control manager. His name is Dror. He was awesome. He listened to my concerns, took pictures, and made sure all the work was done to his standards and mine. Dror was great to work with.

Overall my remodel turned out great. The price didn't change and the work looks awesome. I would recommend Treeium for anyone needing construction work done."
3,Very helpful and always great communication. The project managers were really wonderful and did their best to try and make sure things were as we wanted.
5,"Erez Shifferman, Sam and their Crew at Treeium showed up on time from day one. They are a very professional bunch. They took stress off my shoulders when it came to doing mold remediation in my Master Bathroom. Even though the job was small, they took it VERY seriously because the problem was serious. I really thank them all. His crew members were clean, fast, and they very reliable. I recommend them 100%. Erez was very helpful in explaining the work process. Every time I called or texted, he answered right away. They did an amazing job. Sam took it upon himself to make sure that the mold remediation when smooth and clean. Great job guys!!!"
5,We completed our project on 03-15-2016. Erez Shifferman project manager and his crew did an amazing job on remodeling our master bathroom. They converted a walking shower to a roll in shower and lowered one sink to make these wheelchair accessible. Erez Shifferman was very professional. He keep us informed and he help make this a good experience. we would recommend Treeium to others and have them request Erez Shifferman. It was a pleasure working with him..
5,"I just wanted to commend Treeium for an outstanding job. My husband and I have worked with a couple of different contractors and this is the best experience we have had by far. Our Project Manager, Neev, was so helpful. He was with us every step of the way. We never had to wait long for responses to our questions and he was always solution oriented. If we had a question, he had an answer. If we wanted something addressed, he made it happen. We truly felt like he had our best interest in mind. We never felt pressured, it was about what was best for us and our project. The execution and craftsmanship of our kitchen is beyond our expectations. We would highly recommend Treeium and Neev to anyone! He made the stressful experience of a kitchen renovation pretty pain free."
5,"great general contractor for big jobs, thorough bids submitted promptly. highly recommended. 

their project managers take full ownership of the bidding and supervising process. you can tell the employees have high morale and care deeply about their craftsmanship. 

for our project, they came through with a bid on the bathroom which was fair, but the kitchen was not reasonable. overall, they were 5k over the next lowest bid. Still, id consider hiring Treeium on future projects.. they were very honest and not afraid to put things into writing."
4,"We had a complete kitchen remodel done (changed layout, cabinets, flooring, lighting, etc), along with extra floor replacement in the hallway and family room. After interviewing 3 contractors, Treeium's project manager, Liran Avital, was the only one who really listened to what we wanted as opposed to what is typically done. He proposed options and considerations, and yes we had to make trade offs, but we are so happy with our new kitchen. They were very professional about presenting a visual design and juggling things around so we could make better design choices. The interior designer Michelle was helpful about promoting design strategies and guiding us in our decision making.  Norm, the foreman, was very on top of the progress and keeping us posted; he was always willing to address any of our concerns. The work crews / individuals were friendly, hard working, and clean at the end of every day. Treeium was very accommodating about incorporating things which were slightly out of original scope for no extra cost.  They approached complications with a positive attitude and changed things to satisfy our requirements.    They completed the entire project ahead of schedule . We would hire Treeium again for future remodeling projects."
5,"I just wanted to say, I LOVE the work this company has done!!!! Idan Navon was a helpful Production Manager walked me though the complete process. The workers on the house did a AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL job on the work done!!! They were ALWAYS on time & trusted my judgement on the tile, wood floors & marble counter tops! The workers even helped me pack up the house since I had school & work going on & couldn't do it myself. Treeium is even helping me finish the payments so I can finish paying for the job done. Yes, you will pay a little more for the work, SO WORTH IT FOR THE WAY YOU ARE TREATED!!!! They treat you like family. I would recommend then to ANYBODY who needs renovations!"
5,"We did a complete gut and remodel to our master bath.  We met with Kobi and Amir and hired them to do the job. We received the quality promised at the price promised. No hidden costs during or after. The finished product is just what we wanted, and looks beautiful. I would recommend Treeium for and remodel project you have."
5,"I had such a great experience working with this company. I hired them to install a pretty complicated banister (since the handyman I haired before had already done a lot of damage that needed fixed). The project manager, Guy, was truly fantastic! He walked me through the whole process, was always super responsive and made me feel super comfortable with everything. The contractor came by upon request after hours to answer some questions, and he noticed I was moving in and offered to help out with our move.  The crew worked long hours and late to get the job done before the deadline I needed and it looks incredible and feels super sturdy. I'm so glad I found them and plan to use them to remodel my bathroom next!"
1,"We were referred to Treeium from an online website.  During our initial phone call with them, they were very polite, friendly, and professional.  We told them were were looking to do a home addition.  We had no plans and no permit.  They said they were a full service company, which means, they can do the plans for us, get the permits, and build our project.  Sounds great.  They sent out an email and text to confirm the appointment time.

When their estimator arrived, it turned into a nightmare.  We showed him a rough sketched of what we were looking to do.  He didn't both looking at our sketched and told us since we had no plans, meaning blue prints and construction documents, he can't help us.  When I said we were very clear when we made the appointment, we do not have plans yet and Treeium would have us come up with one should we decide to move forward.  He was not happy with the fact we didn't have a plan, then he just threw out a number between $80k to $1`50k without even looking at what we wanted to do.

When I said, had I known they needed plans before they gave estimates, I would not have had them come out because it was wasting our and his time.  His reply, ""Yes, you are wasting my time.""  Those were his exact words.  After he said that, I sent him on his way.  He was only at our house for five minutes.  

I called Treeium back and informed them what happened.  The lady who answer the phone pulled up our request and she said it clearly stated we had no plans, no permits, and looking for an estimate.  She apologized and offered to send someone else out.  I was so upset at this point, I told her there is no need.

I took the day off from work, the appointment was at 10am on a Wednesday, to meet with them.  I clearly wasted a day of work for a fruitless meeting.  Poor service from their estimator, very rude and extremely unprofessional."
5,"My experience with Treeium and my project manager Ron Admony has been fabulous. I was lucky enough to have stubbled upon Ron and Treeium as they were finishing a remodel in my neighborhood and was so impressed with their work I went over to talk with Ron. He immediately came over to my house and gave me his recommendations for my remodel projects. Not only was I so pleased with his ideas, but also that he took time to come over himself as he said he would that I hired Treeium. They  have continued to offer amazing customer service and quality work.   I have used Treeium for my solar installation, remodeling of  bathrooms, replacing kitchen counters, interior painting, acoustic ceiling removal and electrical work throughout my entire house. Their staff shows up as scheduled, on time and will not leave until the work is completed to your satisfaction.  They all aim to please and will work with you to make sure the end result is what you want.  My project manager, Ron Admony,  is amazing and has become a true friend, always available for any questions or concerns and makes sure that the Treeium staff knows exactly what I am expecting.  I highly recommend Treeium and Ron Admony as your project manager for all your remodel needs, they will make any home project painless."
5,"This is a review if Sam Deen and his crew.  I'm in the middle of a bathroom remodel. I originally contacted Treeium for an estimate to replace a shower in my second bath. From the very start I was very impressed with Sam Deen the project manager. Not only did he arrive on time, he was amicable, yet professional. I need several repairs to my home, so after we walked through the bathroom I asked Sam to provide me with an estimate for the other projects. Not only did he provide me with an itemized estimate that covered everything, he also provided me with individual itemized estimates. Sam and I discussed my budget and agreed to start with remodeling the first bathroom. Never, have I experienced a contractor who listens and understands.  Sam made my best interest his first priority and not how much profit he could make. Sam is reliable, trustworthy and compassionate.  He understands the concerns, financial constraints and yes the anxiety inherent to remodeling. Sam  guided me through design, selecting the tile, fixtures, vanity, etc. He is 100+% dedicated to his customers satisfaction. I have become accustomed too and look forward to Sam's morning call and his. arriving in the morning along with which ever craftsman that is needed for the day.  On the rare occasions he is not present, Sam is on the telephone and/or sending a text message. If, I have any questions or need clarification he's a phone call away. I believe his leadership and presence has helped to the project on schedule. His crew is equally amazing.  They are focused and respectful of your home.  The work area is kept orderly and all traces of materials or debris is completely removed by the end of the day.  Words cannot express how satisfied I am so far.  I am confident  the finished project will be exactly what I expect.  If you're looking for a general contractor I highly recommend you call Treeium and  ask for Sam Deen . You want be disappointed.  I'll update this review when the project has been completed."
5,"I have decided to hire Treeium to do my Kitchen Remodel and I couldn't be happier! About a month ago I met who would later become our project manager, Mr. Neev Kugel, and our experience of working with him has been nothing short of great! His professionalism, experience, and attention to details is what made us decide to move forward with him to begin with, but boy, were we in luck! Neev kept us up-to-dated at all times throughout our project. He made sure all of his workers came on time and completed their job in a timely and professional manner. He went over and beyond to make sure we were happy at any stage of our project, and even included a few extra line items that were not even included in our original agreement. I was hesitant about who I was going to hire to do our project but I am so happy we eventually decided to pick Treeium and I'm delighted to have had the chance to work with our project manager, Neev.

Thank you Treeium for giving us the Kitchen of our dreams and thank you Neev for everything!"
5,"Our new kitchen is almost finished and we've been very impressed with the work of Kobi Farkash and his Treeium team since Day 1! They're organized, clean, communicative and keep to their planned schedule. The quality of the cabinets is excellent. The granite finishing work is fantastic. The onsite work quality has been very good and the workers seem to be proud of their work and like what they're doing. Kobi over-communicates - he texts every evening or morning to remind us what's happening the next day. If we've brought up something to him, his onsite worker knows almost immediately. Kobi has an answer for everything. He is a great problem-solver too - when something didn't quite look right, he came up with several solutions to choose from. We would highly recommend Kobi as your Project Leader!"
4,My bath remodel experience with Treeium was positive.  The crews at all stages of the remodel showed up on time each morning.  There were minor issues that came up but project manager Guy Barnea addressed the issues quickly.  I liked how I was able to order the vanity and tile with the contractor discount.  I received everything I asked for and the result is a bathroom I enjoy!
5,"My name is Pamela Van Horn and I've met Ron Poliker after I've signed a contract with another company. Ron have heard that I signed the contract yet came back after 5 hours to make sure I was not been taken advantage of. He came at 8 pm and reviewed the contract with me and pointed out that there are errors, over sites and over pricing. I contacted the other company and canceled the checks and Ron made sure they will not harass me any more. He gave me a much better price and much broader service. the crew was fast and professional, Ron came in every day and listened to my needs. He had a manage fly in from the head quarters in LA to look after the project. Ron is my guardian Angel!!! 
Thank you very much Ron Poliker!!!!!
Treeium is amazing!!!"
5,"We planned to have our kitchen remodel in late of 2014 with limited budget and had three estimated quotes.  We almost made up our decision with the 2nd contractor and went to his showroom to see and choose the cabinet's door with color & the counter top (our decision already decided before we have the meeting with Ron Admony from Treeium).   Ron Admony ""Project Manager"" from Treeium was the last one that contacted us for the third quotation and had an appointment which we thought we only gave two hours for his presentation as a social manner; but we ended up to pick Ron from Treeium EVEN with highest price of the three quotations.  We are very happy that we picked Ron as our Project Manager, he was consistent to provide his support and helping us to finish the project ahead of the deadline.  As the rule of thumb, everything was not smooth and easy as we were looking for during our remodeling kitchen, there were few obstacles that impacted the progress and may delay the schedule; but Ron Admony was always available either by phone or by coming to contact us regarding of any issues that we encountered when the project started until finished.  He responded to our questions or concerns any time that we had in couple hours or personally came to help us to resolve the issues.  He also provided his inputs to help our decision on color, counter top, and/or anything that will help our remodeling kitchen looks prettier.  His goal is always to make sure his customer satisfaction and happy.  It's really a learning lesson to remodel the kitchen and we're glad that we picked Treeium with Ron Admony as our project manager to work on our project.  The final reward was our beautiful kitchen and our family really enjoyed.  Thanks Ron Admony for great job well done and we're sure to contact you for our next project.  Treeium could be the contractor if you need to pick for any home improvement projects and special Ron Admony will be your Project Manger."
5,"Even if you know what you are doing, any kind of home improvement is potentially very scary.  There are so many things that can go wrong, or unexpected problems that can arise.  So, it has been my experience, to hire a contractor that is a professional & knows what he is doing.  
I am very comfortable & confident in recommending Guy Barnea & Treeium for your home improvement project.
I don't write a lot of reviews, and most are when something goes wrong !!
But in this case, I recognize how important to find a qualified person/company to do contracting work....and want to share with everyone my very positive experience.
His prices are very competitive....(not the cheapest)....but the cheapest price normally gets you the cheapest work....which usually makes it ultimately not the cheapest. And why would you not want the best quality work possible.
Guy's attention to detail, only made me extremely comfortable & confident about my expectations. Everyone from his laborers to supervisors accomplished everything I had asked for and Guy's output only made the ""hurdles"" minimal and made me a very satisfied customer.  
I think the best thing I can say....is if (and when) I have another remodeling project....I now need to make one phone call......which makes this process even better.
Great Work Guy & Treeium............I couldn't be happier !!"
5,"I had my master bathroom done and they did a great job. They are professional and on time with the schedule. They even worked extra hours 
to complete the project. I highly recommended this company"
4,"Great job Treeium! Good customer service Guy Borenstein & Sal. Quality workmanship. Your guys were willing to go the extra mile to make our experience less stressful. They clean up at the end of the day, put furniture back if they had to move them... The project was done 1 week later than scheduled otherwise you would have gotten 5 stars."
5,"We decided to remodel our outdated kitchen and found Treeium on a home improvement website.  After making an appointment Guy Breuer,the project manager,came to discuss our needs and gave us an estimate.  The project entailed a full gut of the kitchen which went very smoothly with a minimal amount of dirt and dust.  Rene, the foreman, and his crew did a very good job of being on time and finishing the project in a reasonable 3.1/2 weeks.  All through the renovation Guy was available to help with the choosing of finishes and design choices.  Though any renovation is stressful the crew from Treeium made the experience a little less so.  We would definitely recommend Treeium."
3,I am in the middle of the project.  Guy Borenstein has been my contact and very helpful and cooperative in the planning process.
5,They replaced the my 24 year old roof that was leaking. With the materials they  use and the cost I am set for next 30 years.
5,"They not only got my kitchen done by Christmas, Kobi and his team were amazing. I will definitely use them again and strongly recommend Treeium."
5,"We just recently completed our first bathroom remodel.  We had received multiple job estimates but chose Treeium because of the excellent presentation by Kobi (who would be the assigned project manager).  He listened to our needs and wishes and gave us clear and concise planning projections.  They met all of the goals and we are so pleased with the outcome.  In fact, we were so pleased that we had them do a complete house re-wire and interior paint job.  The work crews were all extremely professional and took great efforts to accommodate, advise and complete the work within the promised timelines.  The different disciplines were knowledgable with their respective field of expertse.  Kobi visited the site often and ensured excellent communication between the crews.  In one instance there was a minor glitch with an electrical outlet.  Within one hour of our call the PM had an electician out to check it out.  All around outstanding service.  Would use this company again."
5,"Treeium is the BEST!!  We worked with Meir Barzilai and right from the beginning, he was extremely professional, always on time and courteous.  Our project was completed on time and within our budget.  We will always use Treeium for any future projects.  Work with Meir...you won't be disappointed!!"
1,I have been very dissatisfied and frustrated so far with my experience with Treeium. Work started and there were immediately issues after demolition and it took two days to get someone to come out and take a look. Communication has been very poor and they haven't communicated a project plan. I continually have to ask when/if someone is going to come out instead of being kept in the loop. I keep taking time off from work and no one shows up.
5,"I LOVE Trrium.  I built a brand new 3,000 Sq. Foot Luxury Home in Malibu and they installation of Tiles/marble/granite was flawless.  Not a single complaint.  Meir Barzilai and his team are professional, trustworthy and courteous.  The job was completed on time and within our budget.  Meir was at our home daily to oversee and make sure the job was proceeding to his quality and standards.  Extremely hands-on and very focused team with tons of experience, i would highly recommend to anybody!!!"
5,"We recently had our new Laguna Woods home renovated by Treeium.  After an initial rocky start with a person no longer with the company, owner Moty Ginsburg had Ron Admony take over as our Project Manager and he has been excellent to work with, diligent in keeping our project on track and has been completely honest with us in all our dealings. 
 
The project is completed and we are very happy with the results.   We had Treeium add a walk-in shower in one bathroom and make the second into an on-suite master bath.  In addition, they created a laundry closet and opened up the kitchen to allow for a large refrigerator with custom cabinets.  To accomplish this they needed to demolish walls, borrow into the slab for new drainage, create two new walk-in showers and a new master closet.  They installed a beautiful glass bowl vanity and custom linen closet in the master bathroom with glass tiles in the shower and along the back of the vanity.  With Ron at the helm and a very able crew, including Luis, Arturo, Juan and Alex, they were able to get the project to a stage where we could move in on time and then they completed the last stages of the project without delay.  We have received many compliments on how the project turned out and everyone who sees it agrees that Treeium did a great job.  I am attaching photos so you can see the results, however, they do not do it justice.  

We highly recommend Ron Admony and Treeium to do your next project.  Not only will they handle your project with professionalism, they understand how important this is to you and treat you and your property with respect."
5,"Treeium is the best company in la and probably in California !

5,"We hired Treeium to remodel our home which included a completely gutted kitchen, all new electrical rewire, removal of acoustic ceilings, new Travis stone fireplace, refinished hardwood floors,  paint of all walls and a tankless water heater. Itay  guided the process from beginning to end with care and concern that we would be completely satisfied with the job done by each of the contractors. Our dreams of  a small Mediterranean villa were surpassed with the outcome of our beautiful home. We are 150 per cent happy with the work performed by our contractors who were here every single day and the fantastic service from Itay. Our kitchen is going to be the envy of everyone that visits our home. Thank you for making our dreams a reality. Rose and Joe Garcia"
5,"Guy came ready to make our family feel like we don't need any further consultations! 
He was:
Friendly- Called ahead to let us know he was on his way.
Great communicator- IMPORTANT! Listens to every idea and executes it.
Enthusiastic-Really excited to get the job.
Professional-Came with his Badge around his neck w/ ID and License.
Artistic- Visualized something we would have never considered.

So I had researched many different companies to get an estimate on the remodeling process at my mothers home. Going through of course Houzz, HGTV, magazines, remodeling guides, internet, and local ads, Guy made us look no further. 

My family got larger within the year with the birth of our 1 year old son and paying $1,650 for a leased home without utilities, car payments, insurances and daily expenses. We decided to make some changes. To minimize our costs. We plan to remodel the home to make it two private family areas.
My Mother owns a home in a prime location in Atwater Village and it currently has 7 bedrooms, 4 restrooms, 2 kitchens, 1 laundry area, 2 large living rooms and dining rooms and a large front yard and back yard. Not to mention also the garage.  

I had numerous consultations about building UP and making it it a two story home. 
Until, Guy! Once he looked at the place he was so inspired that he actually got me excited after being disappointed with high quotes and bad communication of what we are trying to achieve.
He said the house has a large enough in square footage and that we do NOT need to build up. Mind you; building up you are looking at more time, Money and hard to get permits. (Almost a $2-300,000.00 job which I still have all the past contractors calling and harassing me.) He said that the house is large enough to accommodate two different families with their own private area, entrance etc.. 
He said that it was just not designed right,; It looks like a maze. All we really had to do is rearrange all aspects of the house with a good floor plan, knock down walls, and since pluming is underground  with crawl space that would be the fastest, easiest, and inexpensive solution. HE MADE MY DAY!

Out of so many consultations NOBODY gave me that option. I knew then he wasn't there to just get a job and take my money. 
Anyways he came through a few days later with his virtual 3D designer and she measured the whole house and told me that she will design a likable, livable layout and email it to me with the draft including my furniture. All I had to do is send her photos of my current furniture to incorporate them in the visual display. How awesome. I can edit and change everything to our liking. I am just so excited on the actual construction which I can not review about since we are not there yet. 
So far, So good, But I will definitely update my thoughts throughout the process."
5,"My review is way overdue, it was around this time last year  that I hired Kobi who is one of the greatest project managers I've ever dealt with. I had a fantastic experience with the entire team of Treeium. Today I'm visiting their office to review my electricity bill with them to install solar panels on my house.  Their office is just beautiful; the staff is just amazing and super friendly. It was very nice to actually put a face behind the voice. I would personally like to thank Elizabeth for helping me finance my project at great rates which I can afforded. 

My first project was a kitchen remodel that Kobi, he met all of my expectations and more. He made my dream kitchen a reality.  The cleanup crew was fantastic. I never had to worry about picking up after the contractors when they were finished for the day. 

I have recommended Treeium and Kobi to my friend which hired them as well and is super happy with her project as well. I'm looking forward to installing my solar panels on my house."
5,"I was looking for a company to do my master and main bathroom renovations, but wanted to start out with a smaller project first - stairwell, ceiling refinishing, and painting - to see how well the company managed the project.  I was initially interested in Treeium because I liked the idea that their company was doing their part to be a little more green.  

From the very first meeting with my project manager through to the end of the project, I felt I had all the information about what they could do with my project and how they would go about meeting my ideas.

When we ran into an unexpected structural problem that required additional work before we could move on, my project manager was able to quickly adjust the contract and all the work was still entirely completed on schedule.

Having used a number of different contractors for other big projects in my home, I appreciated most that they took care of the 'little things' to make the whole project look complete.  They removed some fixtures to work through the whole space instead of taking the short cut of just working around the fixtures. They caulked the gaps left from previous work so that it would blend in perfectly with their work.  And, they did some extra finishing on a couple of the walls so that the painting would look even more precise.

I was very pleased with the work Treeium did and the ease of working with them, and am planning my bathroom renovations with them now."
5,"We selected Horizon Construction & Remodeling for our 1954 raised floor home’s main bathroom. We had new electric, plumbing, and more to support a modern bidet toilet, deep soak tub, tile work, custom cabinet, as well as faucets and fixtures in an older and smaller style home. David planed and scheduled the work on time and to costs, which passed all city inspections. Any questions, discrepancies, and requests as our bathroom walls and floors were opened, items installed, or final finish and refinements were promptly addressed to satisfaction. Enna Eskin also followed through on all administrative matters and various communications as the project progressed. A special thanks to the electricians and tile workers that were very professional, educational, skilled, and made value added recommendations for our decision-making. Thanks Horizon Construction !"
5,"This is our second remodel with Horizon construction & remodeling
We remodeled another bathroom last year with them
David our project manager was really good and helpful as always 

If we have anything else to remodel we will definitely call them !"
5,Horizon construction & remodeling did a fabulous job on my bathroom. The work was above excellent. Workers were timely thoughtful  and professional. I would recommend  Horizon to anyone.
5,"I recently remodeled my house and was sorely disappointed.  I was a bit gun shy to try again, but changed my mind after being stuck ay home during the covid lockdown. 


I decided to find a new contractor, and was lucky enough to find Mark Besnos, the owner of Horizon Construction and Remodeling.


Mark was able to make my vision a  reality, which was no small task.  He worked with my designer, Misti Riedel and I and had the patience of a saint.  This time around, it was an enjoyable experience.  


I wake up every morning and walk out into the main living area with a big smile on my face.  Before Mark remodeled, my place was so drab.  

I truly love my house and thank everyone for helping me."
5,"We selected Horizon Construction & remodeling in Fullerton because of their high rated reviews and we felt very comfortable with David Eskin the project manager. we thought he will be a good match since we will need to communicate with him on daily basis for the entire length of our remodel. He helped us design our new kitchen and bathroom and select materials while keeping up to code.
we wanted to achieve clean and simple look, more space on our counters along with timeless design. 
The results exceeded our expectations. We love it!"
5,"This my experience with Horizon Construction and Remodeling,
and why I recommend them.
This is the second time that I have hired a contractor. The first time was a bathroom remodel, and it was a disaster, so I was very apprehensive about hiring another contractor.  We needed to remodel our kitchen, so I had no choice. I did my due diligence and research and called three companies to interview. All three I had no prior knowledge of or experience with. Out of the three bids, there was a high, a medium, and a low.
After talking to them one more time I went with the medium bid company. That company is called Horizon Construction and Remodeling. It turns out I made the right choice. My experience with this company is the complete opposite from my first experience with a contractor. 
My Project Manager was Mark, who did an outstanding job of keeping the project moving quickly efficiently. His crews showed up on time, were professional and did quality work, from plumbing to electrical to framing to painting to cabinets all were done to my satisfaction. If something was not done to my satisfaction (which was rare), I just let Mark know about it and he would send someone to either redo or touch-up the work. Mark would visit the job site frequently.
I feel Mark is honest and has his customer’s best interest at heart. There were a couple of times when he could have charged me extra money for items that came up during the project, but he did not. 
Like any project we had to make some changes along the way, and Mark is very willing to work with you to make sure that you get what you want. Mark will listen to your ideas plus he has many ideas himself. He helped us a lot with our kitchen design.
They started my project Oct. 11, 2001. My wife and I were hoping to have the project done by Christmas. They had it done in 7 weeks in time for Thanksgiving!
The inside staff is led be Enna. They make sure everything is ordered on time. They even arrange for inspections. They are very polite and efficient and responsive.
We are doing our doors and windows next and we going to have Horizon Construction and Design do the work.
I recommend Horizon Construction and Design; I give them a strong 10.

Mark and Diane Kincheloe   
Fountain Valley, CA."
5,"Horizon Construction & Remodeling, did everything they promised. Their man did quality work. They said “it will be done” and it was done as they said.
Our Kitchen & bathroom remodel turned better than we thought. 
Mark helped with the design and selecting all the materials and that was very helpful. 
We would recommend them to anyone."
5,I completely renovation my 1 bedroom condo in the City of Fullerton.  Everything was removed from flooring walls kitchen bathroom  walk in  closet. The outcome was outstanding. I couldn't believe how great everyting. Turnedd out.. Every time I come home it's like walking into a model home.. I enjoy Everything and my favorite place is kitchen and patio BBQing and watching sports on my new patio TV.
5,"It was a pleasure working with Horizon Construction and Remodeling, on the complete renovation of my kitchen. David and Enna were extremely knowledgable and professional.  The crew were also very polite, friendly and considerate in the care of cleaning up the worksite everyday, and making sure I was happy with the work done each day.  I will definitely use Horizon on my next project, and highly recommend them.  Thank you to everyone who made our dream kitchen possible.

5,"We recently just finished a remodel of two bathrooms using Horizon for the project. They were easy to work with and worked hard to accommodate a house with four people working from home. Working with their design team, installers, and trades people, the entire project came together without issue. They even helped us by doing some things out of order to ease the burden of a family of four using just one working bathroom.  But the real payoff was in the end product. For that a picture is worth a 1000 words. We are so pleased with our new bathrooms! Thank you to the team at Horizon!"
5,"Such a pleasure to work with Mark and the entire staff at Horizon Construction. Not only did they remodel our entire house filled with furniture during a pandemic, but we did the whole process from out of town. Mark and his staff kept us constantly up to date via Zoom, phone calls, and loads of texts and emails. And the best part is the house turned out better than expected! They made sure the work was done exactly the way we planned and to our expectations, which included guaranteeing anything that went wrong. Mark was a big help in the design process which included helpful advise on where we should spend money and where we could cut corners. He also had little things done along the way, some that he didn't charge us for but that were necessary to make the house look more finished. Lastly, they took great care in making sure the furniture and home decor were protected and covered during the whole process, and whatever was moved was put back where they found it.  We are so grateful for the hard work, service, and patience that went into making our house look beautifully updated!"
5,"So happy to have gone with Horizon Construction for our major kitchen, and 2 bath, remodel project.! From the first meeting with Mark, the owner, I felt that he was trustworthy, knowledgeable and fair. He, and the Horizon Construction crews, did not disappoint. Communication with Mark, Enna, and the office staff were admirable. Mark's design expertise was very helpful. He met all of our wants & needs. Our kitchen was taken from a poorly designed eyesore to a beautiful space. We had major structural work, removal of load bearing beams and steel moment frame, installing three steel beams at the ceiling to create an open floor plan. We completely changed the footprint of the kitchen. Custom cabinets turned out beautifully! The materials purchased through Horizon Design were of high quality and sourced in a timely manner. Workers were friendly, arrived on time and cleaned up at the end of each day. We were so pleased with the kitchen that we added on two bath remodels which were completed along with the kitchen. Thank you Horizon for delivering a quality space which we are happy to invite our friends & family to. We will enjoy the beautiful kitchen & bathrooms for many years to come!"
5,"Horizon construction & Remodeling remodeled/updated both my master and the main bathrooms, which were in their original mid-60s construction state.  David Eskin and his team of tradesmen helped bring my vision to fruition.  As with any project, once the walls were opened up, some revisions were required; based upon their expertise and experience, Horizon was able to provide a few suggestions and a few “tweaks” to address these revisions.  I couldn’t be happier with the results! Both bathrooms are much more functional and beautiful!
Horizon also did some minor improvements in my laundry area – again improving the functionality and looks!
Note: Remodeling costs did not cover much of the material costs.  I had already selected and/or purchased some of the building materials; I did research and purchase much of the remaining materials (tub, vanities, tiles). Horizon does have its own showroom, and could have provided these at an additional cost.  However, because I already had a firm idea as to what I wanted, I handled the ordering of these myself."
5,"Our kitchen was remodeled by Mark Besnos and Enna at Horizon Construction and Remodeling. We chose them after seeing all the great reviews on the Houzz app. When we walked into their showroom, we were warmly greeted by Diana who made us feel very comfortable.  Their product display made it easy for us to put our ideas together. Mark’s crew did a wonderful job.  Kudos to his crew, they really worked hard. Joel Chavez was a standout carpenter/jack of all trades doing much of the major work and tying together any imperfections and any loose ends that arose with a great attitude, expertise, and skill. He’s quite an asset to Horizon.  Antonio Garcia who did our fabulous backsplash and Tom Tzur was the electrician.  Mark ensured that each phase of the project was done correctly and completed on time (about 8 weeks). We gutted and replaced our 80’s kitchen (10’ by 10’) including the small dining area. We kept the same layout but switched the positions of the sink, stove and refrigerator.  Enna helped with all the communication and paperwork and scheduling of the inspections, payments etc.  Thanks to Mark, Enna, and their crew, we have a beautiful modern kitchen with two toned white and blue cabinets.  
Lessons Learned:
1.Stick to your budget and have extra funds for unforeseen things because for sure there will always be something that will come up.  Understand what is and is not included in your contract.  Don’t just assume that everything is included.
2.Be flexible with your time. There is a general outline of what jobs will be done in order mostly during the weekdays but things may change with short notice.  
3.Check that your materials/colors are in stock before you sign your contract. Due to the Covid and political environment, some materials may take longer to get or not at all.  Some newer colors may cost more.
4.Look at your cabinet colors in every light.  We first looked at an espresso-colored cabinet that looked like black in shade and looked light cherry colored under the full sun. 
5.Know what crown molding you want for the top of your cabinets…having pictures will help.
6.Ask Mark if you are not sure of any detail or work that has to be done. Do not wing it…else any fixes may cost you extra. 
7.For lighting such as chandeliers, measure everything. Use you tube to learn to measure your lighting fixtures.
8.Certain changes such as electrical, structural will require city permits and inspections.  Your city’s inspector’s availability will cause delays up to one week. 
9.Choose your grout color for the backsplash…apparently there’s a ton of them (we were looking at different shades of grey because white is too hard to clean). 
10.Choose your door and doorknobs ahead of time. Check to make sure it works including deadbolt after it’s been installed.
11.Choose your baseboard style and size.
12.Choose your light dimmers switches."
5,"After shopping several companies, we chose Horizon Construction and Remodeling for our home improvement project, which was to enlarge and update our kitchen and main bathroom.  In addition, we converted all of our flooring to vinyl.
We are extremely happy with the service, responsiveness, dependability, and the results Horizon provided.  David Eskin was our project manager.  David became a consultant and friend during the process.  He proved to be patient and honest when we encountered an issue with the granite installation for our kitchen.  We upgraded our material to a beautiful and unique Brazilian granite for our kitchen counter.  Our initial granite slab cracked 3 feet across the width of the counter 2 days after installation.  David and his crew reviewed the issue and, without hesitation or argument, removed the cracked granite and replaced it with a new slab at their cost.  Although this experience was extremely stressful for all, the integrity displayed by David and Horizon was stellar and unique in the construction industry.  Contractors are easy to find, but an honest and dependable one is rare in our opinion.  On this experience alone, we would recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling without reservation.  They made it right.
All construction is stressful and we lived in our house during the remodel.  This project was our first in this home, but our fourth major reconstruction in our 45 years of marriage.  Horizon was by far the best remodel experience!"
5,"We were referred to Horizon Construction and Remodeling from my sister's coworker at Houzz for a full kitchen remodel. Our consultation went wonderfully and we felt very comfortable with David. He did a great job explaining their company and the process for our kitchen remodel. He was able to take all of our ideas for the kitchen and make them a reality. He was honest and helpful throughout the whole process and we did not have to stress about all the things you hear other people having to go through during a remodel. He was quick to respond to any emails, calls or texts. The only thing I wish we would have received without asking for was a weekly schedule on what was happening each day and who we would be expecting at the house and what time so we could plan ahead as full time working parents. Overall we were very happy with every contractor who worked on the kitchen! We do not have one complaint about any of the people that came into our house throughout the remodel. We would highly recommend Horizon to our families and friends for any future remodeling and would us them again in the future. We feel that we now have our dream kitchen thanks to the team at Horizon Construction and Remodeling."
5,"We had a fairly large, relatively unused laundry room and a guest bedroom without an attached guest bathroom.  After hunting for a contractor I met Michael who was really friendly, had a clear cut understanding of what I was looking to do without much back and forth, and gave me a break down quote for each aspect of the project in a fast and timely fashion. We converted our downstairs bedroom into a mini master suite with an attached bathroom, French doors where a window once was, and sound proofing of the walls to prevent noise from our flat screen in the family room that shares a wall. We then made a smaller laundry nook. Albeit a few scheduling communication errors, everything was done with care and what I really liked was how Michael would come and look at things and notice stuff that I didn't even see and get them fixed and or corrected on his routine walk throughs. Additionally, the workers that would come to the house never made me feel uncomfortable or worried."
5,"We recently remodeled our Master bathroom and chose Horizon Construction & Remodeling in Fullerton to do the job.  Overall, we had a great experience! We were given a fair price for our remodel and the quality of work was excellent.  Everyone we worked with was polite, courteous and professional.  Any minor issues that came up were addressed promptly and correctly.  Our bathroom looks a million times better is a lot more functional.  Bravo to David, our General Contractor, and his crew!  We would definitely recommend Horizon Construction & Remodeling to anyone and we plan to use them again for our next remodeling project.

5,"When you realize you need work done by a contractor, a lot of apprehension may go through your mind.  But those fears and doubts will be washed away if you choose to work with Horizon Construction & Remodeling in Fullerton, CA 92832.   We dealt mostly with David and from our first meeting we had a good feeling about working with him and Horizon.   David really listened to our ideas and gave us a few of his own which we never would have thought about.   While we wanted to do a few small projects as well (painting all rooms in our house with new flooring, lighting and baseboards), our “big” decision was to remodel our kitchen.    This was a complete gut down to the bare bones of the room then build it back up.  Throughout the entire process David made frequent visits to check on progress, answer questions, and if something needed to be looked into, he was on it right away.  His team always came as scheduled, and we were always looped in every step of the way.   David’s timeline for completion was right on target as well.   It helps that we too were always ready with whatever we needed to provide such as ordering and delivery of our new kitchen appliances, picking lighting fixtures and paint colors and coming to the show room to pick out our flooring, cabinetry, countertops and back splash.  And by the way, their showroom has a large array of options to choose from.  We even had a few last-minute thoughts of having the facing of our fireplace redone and adding some extra lighting in the home to which David accommodated easily.  Even with a few snags due to Covid 19 whereas the countertop and backsplash we picked (which had been on order for months) was suddenly unavailable, his team was on it and helped us pick back up options, to which we found we loved more than our original choices.   In the office, we also worked at times with Maria and Enna, both of whom were pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful to us.    David’s team was courteous and respectful and followed safety protocols like wearing masks.   Since we worked from home, it was easy to practice distancing since we were all in different rooms.  And if the workers needed to speak to us, everyone wore masks and stood apart out of courtesy.    We were overwhelmed with how beautiful the kitchen turned out and were just as pleased with how refreshed and updated our whole interior looks now.   We would highly recommend working with the team at Horizon because this experience helped us rest those apprehensions I spoke of in the beginning.   And we achieved what we wanted in that now when you walk in our kitchen, you just say “WOW.”  Thank you."
4,"We had our completely remodeled, removed a load-bearing wall to open up the kitchen to the den. We also did a full remodel on our small master bathroom to create a big master bath with a small walk-in closet which we did not have before. Also our laundry room was moved to the hallway along with some change orders along the way. We are very happy with the end result and we are enjoying our new home."
5,"Excellent results! What was once a dirty, moldy, ugly bathroom now looks like a spa bathroom in a Vegas hotel; I’m still amazed at the transformation even now that it’s been operational for a while. 

David was very responsive to texts, and always followed up to be sure things were going well, and even when I wanted a big, heavy mirrored medicine cabinet against his recommendation, he graciously had the backsplash tiles adjusted so the back wall could be rewired, then hung the mirror and now it looks great. At least I think it does.

I wanted a particular finish on the cabinets, but he advised to go much darker, which was counter(get it?)intuitive to me, but he was absolutely right, and the dark cabinets contrast perfectly with the earth-tones and creams throughout the rest of the bathroom; I’m glad for his recommendation as it maintains the warm design while providing an elegant touch. 

I can be a difficult client, but David was gracious throughout, and his subcontractors all did a great job and were very pleasant. I also appreciate that while it wasn’t the biggest project, just a smallish bathroom, he gave it his all and treated it like a project of any size; I was actually rejected by a couple of contractors because the project wasn’t ‘big enough’ but David and Horizon gave it their all. I can’t be happier with the end result - the transformation is nothing short of remarkable."
5,"David Eskin with Horizon Construction and Remodeling did a great job coordinating the remodel. All the trades did an excellent job. Any issues were responded to and fixed immediately. We are very happy with the finished product, and will use them again in the future."
5,"We are happy to see the remodeling is completed.  I am satisfied with the materials chosen and the suggestions made throughout the process.  Alicia and Mark Besnos collaborated in choosing the design materials.  We look forward to many years of our new bathrooms.   
Thank you Horizon Construction & Remodeling for the remodels.

Brian and Alicia Dolan"
5,"I had an excellent experience with David from Horizon Construction on an exterior project recently completely and would recommend them highly for any project internal or external.

David was extremely professional throughout the entire process.  From the initial call and consultation we tossed ideas back and forth, his vision was exactly what I was looking for.  He promptly sent images of ideas and websites for me to review and even though we didn't exactly meet at times he was flexible to accept my idea and in the end we came up with something I am very proud of!    To be honest...there where issues, but not with him!   He came through and directed his team to fix not only things I found, but even things that did not fit his image of perfection....he never flinched, his quality was excellent and did not let his team fall behind!   Again, I am extremely happy with the service, vision and final product and would recommend them anytime you have a project you want perfection."
5,"Having chosen Horizon Construction & Remodeling for our project was the best decision we could have made.  The Project Manager, Eitan Beznos made sure that we were completely satisfied 

every step of the way making sure that all of our concerns were addressed.  He was very pleasant and easy to communicate with.  The completed job looks amazing, we could not be 

more satisfied and, we get many compliments from strangers that walk or drive by.  A big kudos to all those involved in the project and we will most definitely recommend Horizon to 

our friends, neighbors and family.

5,"The upstairs bath had been partially remodeled prior to purchasing my condo 5 years ago. It had an updated vanity and lavatory, but the tub and shower combination were the original fiberglass builder-grade enclosure and definitely showed its age of 30 plus years. I wanted this bathroom to look as good as the rest of my home with a new tub, new tile, and new flooring.
Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc. expertly gave me exactly the bath I desired. Horizon’s showroom had ample samples of tiles and I was easily able to select the bath/shower wall tile and flooring that unified my vision. I did not have to wait long for the job to commence and all work was done as quickly as I could have hoped. The only delays were due to unavoidable waiting for inspections and a holiday that delayed one inspection. For those tasks that did not require an inspection to proceed, the trade contractor would show up the following morning. I was able to have my walls retextured and painted, a new overhead light added above the bath/shower, replace the medicine cabinet, and a new exhaust fan and all fixtures installed for the completed beautifully finished bathroom.
My project manager David Eskin coordinated each trade and supplies wonderfully. All of the contractors selected for my project were very professional and I appreciate how quickly and well each performed their trade work. I am delighted with workmanship and the end results."
4,"We had a kitchen and powder room remodel Aug- Oct 2020. We love the final product! It is pretty much exactly what We envisioned. The project finished in a timely manner, and his guys did a phenomenal job; especially tile (Fernando) and cabinets (sorry I don’t remember everyone’s name). Mark was knowledgeable and answered our questions promptly. He was good at showing up frequently and reviewing all the work. 

My only suggestion for improvement would be giving a more accurate estimate, and notifying the owners of the cost of any changes prior to the work being done. The project ended up quite a bit more than anticipated. However, we are happy with the result, and would recommend Horizon to others."
5,"We had our kitchen entirely re-done by Horizon Construction & Remodeling. Horizon replaced our cabinets, sink, inserted a backsplash, rewired our receptacles to meet current code and repainted the walls. They also installed recessed lighting under the cabinets which really brings out the ambiance of the kitchen overall. It was a complex operation and they project-managed it flawlessly. They took a lot of time to truly understand what we wanted and then provided examples and expertise to help guide us to our final decisions. We could not recommend them more for anyone looking to remodel their kitchen."
5,"On behalf of my husband and myself, we highly recommend Horizon Construction for your home projects. This recommendation letter is long overdue. We hired Horizon Construction Inc. in the summer of 2019 to gut and remodel a master bedroom bath and install a sliding glass door. Michael the construction manager was very transparent with us about the timeline and the steps and costs. Everything was done exactly as he said.

To begin with the contract manager Michael was an utmost professional. We told him what we wanted and he gave us a reasonable estimate that closely matched our own estimated costs. As recommended before committing to hiring a contractor we requested 2 other estimates, one came in ridiculously higher than Horizon and one quite a bit lower than Horizon, but we went with Horizon because of Michael’s evident knowledge and on spot recommendations. The meeting with the other contractors didn’t leave my husband or I with the same confidence in amount of knowledge of process and esthetic know how. In the long run Michael’s trained eye for function and aesthetic helped us come up with a design that we are extremely happy with.

Their entire crew was extremely knowledgeable and efficient. We were extremely pleased with their attention to detail and craftsmanship."
5,"We did our master bath remodeling this year and we chose Horizon construction for the second time. Mark the owner, as usual, came up with the perfect design for our relatively small space. The design let us include a big shower, closed bathroom area and lots of closets. Something I did not think we could accomplished at first.
The construction went fast considering the City closure for Covid19. They did a fantastic job and kept everything clean during the construction.
We now have a very beautiful Master Bath we enjoy every day. I recommend Horizon Construction for any remodeling you need. They are very good at what they do"
5,"Professional work done by professional workers in a professional way. We highly recommend Horizon for any home improvement or repair that you might do. Last year Horizon repaired the stucco, wood trim and painted our house. The paint started to peel on part of the trim and they promptly repaired it at no charge. We are also happy with the patio cover they did for us last year.   Steve an Toni G"
5,"Our wrought iron fence was on its last leg, already rotted through.  We wanted a short block wall topped by a vinyl fence. I found Horizon Construction on a couple of the “help” websites and called them. Eitan Beznos came out, discussed the job and provided an estimate. We came to an agreement and they started the next week. The block wall went fast, they finished the 2’ H x 60’ L wall in one day. It is on top of a steep 60’ tall hill.  The job was completed in a timely manner.  All along, Eitan kept me aware of progress and status.  He came out to inspect the job. At the end, Eitan and the company owner/manager came out and inspected the job to make sure we were satisfied.  We could not have been anymore satisfied with the work, the timeliness, and the cleanup efforts. Horizon finished the job on the originally forecast completion date.  I would recommend Horizon and Eitan Beznos for any construction or re-modeling efforts you might have.

5,"We got bids from 5 different contractors for the construction we needed in our backyard. We were converting our garage into an additional dwelling unit (ADU), which has very specific requirements in most cities. David Eskin came out from Horizon; they were the last bid we received. All the bids came in just about the same ballpark, but we chose Horizon because David seemed very upfront and personable at our first meeting. He took the time to address our questions and concerns; all of them, even if we didn’t particularly want to hear the answers. We trusted him. We live in a historical home, so there were many rules we needed to follow and styles we needed to match exactly. David, his crew and Horizon did that perfectly. We ran into some problems because our house is old. They couldn’t have been foreseen because nobody knew what was under our garage. Those problems were frustrating and added expense to our project, but David and Enna at the office helped us through those as well. The interior turned out so much better than we imagined it would! It’s just beautiful. We would recommend Horizon to anyone needing to get any work done in or around their home. Awesome company!!"
5,"Eitan Beznos of Horizon Construction did a major Remodeling on my kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms and garage. This included:
New patio slab.
Removal of wall and load bearing 4x4's.
Kitchen island.
Fireplace.
New roof.
New ceiling.
Complete rewire of house and garage. 
Power panel upgrade and electric car charger in garage.
Paint interior and exterior.

Eitan was the project manager. He was easy to work with and there was good communication with Eitan and the office staff. The process was clearly written down and all questions were answered.

I did not know exactly what I wanted and Eitan made useful suggestions. He designed the layouts and helped me select materials for the floor, ceiling, kitchen counters and bathrooms.

Eitan pulled permits and all of the inspections were passed.
There were often several teams of workers in the house at the same time. Eitan coordinated the work to insure that the progress was efficient and that different groups did not get into each others way.

When problems came up Eitan dealt with them. Termite damage was discovered and had to be addressed before a bathroom could be completed.
Building codes required that work had to stop when old flooring was removed by a hazmat company.

While I thought that the quotes were high, what I got were clear goals, quality of work, management of workers, problem resolving and the overall progress of the project.

I was very satisfied with the end result. The open floor plan between kitchen and family room and the removal of cupboards in the hallway, makes the house look very expansive. The transformation was stunning.

I would recommend Eitan for home remodeling.

5,"I had the bathtub removed from the master bath and a shower with a steam unit installed. David Eskin was the project manager and was a pleasure to work with. Despite the current pandemic situation, David kept the project going. The workers were amazing, each one an expert in their respective craft. The job was finished beautifully and I’m very happy with the results. I would highly recommend Horizon Construction for any remodeling job."
5,"If you're shopping contractors, and want to avoid a nightmare, read this. Licensed contractors are not all the same. Horizon Construction & Remodeling gets 5 stars. This company delivered what was promised. I'm not affiliated with Horizon in any capacity. I'm a customer, who hired them to remodel my bathroom after calling 5 other contractors, who either didn't show up, or quoted ridiculous bids. Mark, who owns the company with his wife, Enna, gave me a quote that was right about middle range. He paid attention to my vision, and when I asked  his opinion, he had great ideas, but was never forceful. He was also right up front about everything—nothing hidden. After I decided to sign the contract, I was still somewhat skeptical. Bathrooms and kitchens are multi-phase projects, and things can go south quickly. I'd already heard all the nightmares about hiring the wrong contractor. By day 2, I noticed that Mark, also my project manager, stayed on top of every detail, so I stopped stressing. All the crews he sent for each phase were skilled, knowledgable, and cleaned up afterwards. I got the impression this company only uses competent crews, who produce quality workmanship. No problems communicating, either. Mark was always available. Another thing: he's organized, and kept the project moving forward. The staff appeared to be organized, as well. I'm thrilled with the appearance and function of my new bathroom—it's gorgeous. It turned out much better than I had expected.  If I have another remodel project in the future, I won't hesitate to hire them again. Thank you so much, Mark, Enna, Grace, Anna, Maria and staff!"
4,"We had a great experience with David Eskin on the remodel of our kitchen and floors in 2019. Work was completed on time and his workers were outstanding.  Four months after completion there was a problem with the grout cracking along the kitchen counter and David promptly sent his tile guy out to re-do the cracking grout.  Now, four months later, the problem occurred again. David promptly responded again and this time they used a flexible material that matched the grout perfectly.  In my experience Horizon Construction stands by their work and has responded quickly to my concerns even after the project was completed."
5,"I hired Mark Besnos and Enna of Horizon Construction and Remodeling in the spring of 2019 to do a complete kitchen remodel which included removing a load bearing wall and removing a gas fireplace.  The actual construction began with the demolition in mid-July and the job was completed the last week of October. I had a great experience overall despite the usual stresses of a home remodeling project (and living in the house during construction). Mark listened to my ideas and concerns and he helped me bring the beach cottage home of my dreams to fruition. He was very knowledgeable and gave me great advice on every aspect of the project. Mark and Enna invited me to their showroom in Fullerton and showed me a wide variety of materials (flooring, tile, Quartz, cabinetry, etc.) to choose from.  I appreciated Mark’s attention to detail, thorough explanation of our contract, extensive resources, and consistent open communication. Mark was the project manager for my remodel and he was onsite regularly to oversee his crew. I always felt as though my project was Mark and Enna’s top priority. Any time I had a question or concern, Mark and/or Enna, promptly took my call or immediately called me back. Mark was committed to keeping the project on schedule as much as possible, even when unforeseen delays occurred due to materials being held up. He always had a plan B to keep things moving. All of his crew members were very reliable, courteous, and dedicated. Many of his crew members even came to my house on weekends. I am extremely happy with my new, improved, expansive kitchen, living, and dining room. I absolutely love it! A huge Thank You to Mark, Enna, the incredible office staff (Genesis and Vanessa) and to all of the skilled craftsmen at Horizon for creating a beautiful home for my family!"
5,"Horizon construction and Remodeling did a major kitchen remodel for us including removal of walls, fireplace, and reconstruct a large portion of our ceiling.  They literally transformed our kitchen!  
After checking out many others, we decided to choose Horizon Construction and Remodeling because of all the great reviews.  After meeting the staff, our project manager David Eskin and reading all the positive reviews we knew we made the right decision.  The staff is wonderful.  Very caring, respectful and honest.  Our kitchen turned out  beautiful.  We are very happy with the outcome!

Demolition was right on schedule and the crew was excellent, very fast and left the job neat at the end of the day. We did however encounter a set back which caused a long pause after demolition.  This lengthened the job quite a bit and added additional expense and inconvenience (we feel) could have been avoided with a more through inspection (pre-demo). 
All the staff at Horizon are great to work with.  David our project manager is terrific.  He is easy to work with and very helpful.  He provided suggestions that were very helpful and added to the beauty of our job.  There were times he could have lost his patience because of my indecisiveness but never once did!  He’s a true gentleman.
Caesar our cabinet maker is a master at his trade.  We love his work and are so pleased with our cabinets!
Something notable that you may not find in many other constructions companies.  With Horizon, once the project ends, they treat you with the same kindness as the day you signed the contract.  

This company shines in Customer satisfaction!"
5,"We recently had our 2500 square foot home remodeled by Horizon Construction & Remodel, which included the kitchen, master bath, flooring, lighting, paint, fireplaces, millwork, plumbing and tile.  We contacted a total of four general contractors, all of whom were within the same approximate price range, however, after meeting with Mike Roppo, we decided to sign a contract with Horizon and we’re glad we did!  Mike was our Project Manager and he did an excellent job overseeing and managing the entire project from start to finish.  He is professional, knowledgeable, personable and made sure that everything was done right!  He was quick to respond to phone calls, texts, and emails and came by to check the work often.  We are retired so we were able monitor the work as it was being completed.  At times issues would arise, but whenever we expressed a concern, Mike was prompt to resolve it, making sure that all work was done to our complete satisfaction and that no corners were cut.  All of the contractors that worked in our home were very experienced and good at what they did!  We were especially impressed with Hector who painted the entire inside of the house, and Victor who did all of the tile and marble work in the master bath, kitchen, and fireplaces.  Also Ulyses (plumbing), Hugo (flooring), Caesar (countertops), and Tomar (electrician), were all excellent at their crafts.   The process of remodeling our entire home took five months and everything turned our beautiful!  Horizon Construction & Remodel is an excellent company that stands behind their work and prides themselves in customer satisfaction!"
5,"All workmanship and workers were very professional and very nice. 

They always cleaned after their jobs. We are very happy with the way our bathroom turned out. 

Michaelangelo Roppo - our project manager was very helpful. He spend 2 days shopping with me, picking out everything was needed for the remodel. And I DO MEAN EVERYTHING. 

i really did appreciate his time snd expertise. 

The ladies in the office are very nice. 

Enna Eskin helped me match colors and styles for cabinets and counter tops in Horizon's showroom. 

I will recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling for any of your projects"
5,"Our goal was to remodel the kitchen, guest bathroom, and flooring of our home. This is the very first time my wife and I have ever took on a major remodel project. It was important to have a contractor that was honest , responsive, and did quality work within our budget. Since my wife and I work and are extremely busy with our kids, it was also important that we have project manager that would communicate with us and closely monitor the people working on our home regarding quality. We met with Eitan, project manager for Horizon Construction  and he took the time to understand that these qualities were important to us. He was also very honest about the project and did not overpromise just to earn our business. Eitan and his company made sure we knew they wanted to do what’s best for us and immediately we felt confident Horizon was fit for the job. His crews were very professional and would answer our questions and always cleaned up when they left for the day. Of course there were some hiccups during the project such as the fridge not fitting in the space and some kitchen cabinets needing to be moved around and adjusted. In the end, the things we requested got fixed and Eitan made sure we were happy. I would recommend Horizon to those that see the value of a project manager. Overall, the quality was good for our budget and I would rate Horizon a 4.7 out of 5."
5,"I has Horizon Construction & Remodeling out to do a bid to remodel a guest and master bathroom because of their high rating on Angie’s list.  An appointment was made and David Eskin showed up right on time.  He gave me a detailed bid right on the spot in writing.  Horizon did each bathroom separately so I could always have a usable shower.  I had already picked out most finishes before I got bids.  However, after the backsplash I had picked out was installed, I hated it.  David was great and said they would re-do it no problem with whatever alternative tile I picked.  There were some issues throughout the process that came up but I really appreciated that David and his subcontractors always came up with a solution.  The final products are beautiful.  Now I have 2 spa-like bathrooms with modern finishes that I’m thrilled to show off."
5,"We contracted Horizon Remodeling to remodel our fireplace and paint our kitchen, family room, living room and hallway.  Eitan Beznos managed the project and was extremely conscientious making sure all work was done correctly and completed as promised.  He met with us frequently to check progress and make sure work was done to our satisfaction.  When we asked for additional electrical work, he arranged for an excellent electrician named Tomer who did a fantastic job for us,
We would recommend Horizon Remodeling.  Work was well done and finished earlier than promised."
5,"Horizon completed a 450 square foot addition on our house that included moving an exterior wall and reworking the roof line to add a bathroom and expand three bedrooms.  This project took place from July 2019 to November 2019.  Our primary criteria for selecting a construction company was familiarity with working with our city, timeliness, and quality of work  performed.

We are very happy with the final product of this project.  The finished work provided by Horizon Construction is beautiful and works well within our high end home. The craftsmen used for the detail work were top notch, and the projects that needed to match existing finishes in the house look nearly flawless in their integration.  We did not have any problems with permitting the plans or with passing the inspections with the city so there were no hold ups time wise because of inspection issues.

When any hiccups did occur, as they occur in any remodel or home project, Horizon was very quick to correct them to the best of their ability or propose solutions that would result in the same high end product we were looking for.  The customer service provided was quite good.

David is a great project manager and was very attentive. He made sure any and all concerns were addressed promptly and that questions were answered in a very timely manner.  He was great about working with me in regards to our timeline and making the process of living through the project as painless as possible.

In short, I am quite happy that we chose Horizon Construction for our addition project and would absolutely recommend them."
5,"I decided to do a complete bathroom remodel, and after meeting with several contractors, I decided on Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc.. I am very happy with my overall experience. My bathrooms look absolutely beautiful. Horizon gutted both bathrooms and replaced everything with new white porcelain tile, sparkling mosaic panels and backsplash, sturdy glass doors, chrome trims, and all new fixtures. They painted both bathrooms light grey with white trims, and replaced the laminate floors with light grey toned tile. I love the results and I am glad I decided to do business with Horizon.

I also had a great experience with Horizon’s customer service. They provide excellent service. Everyone I spoke with (demolition crew, plumber, office staff, contractor, owner) was professional, competent, and courteous. Initially, I was in constant contact with contractor, David Eskin. He was punctual, knowledgeable, and professional. In the second half of the project, I was in constant contact with Enna. She was professional, knowledgeable, and very attentive to my requests. Whenever I had a question or concern, I could text her and she would respond within minutes. That was important to me and I appreciated the expediency. Based on my customer experience with Enna, I can say she cares a lot about the reputation of the company and delivering great customer satisfaction. The project is now complete, and thanks to Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc., I have two beautiful bathrooms."
5,"My wife and I have added a master bathroom and walk in closet, as well as adding a new linen closet and floors throughout the house with Horizon Construction. We are so happy with the outcome and how our project manager answered any questions we had along the way. We feel confident that if any issues pop up in the future that we can call and they will send someone out to correct. We have referred Horizon to our friends and will recommend them in the future as we are so happy with the outcome of our house."
5,"I contacted Houzz to search for a contractor to remodel our two small bathrooms.  I did not know where to start.  They put me in touch with Horizon and within a couple of days I was meeting with Eitan Beznos, their bathroom specialist. What impressed me most about Eitan was his friendliness and his desire to look after my every remodeling need. He was up front with the cost and the time it would take to complete both bathrooms. He recommended the best place to shop for tile and bathroom fixtures. He even took me shopping to look for vanities and helped me choose the size and design I was looking for.  Once the work was started the project crew became extended family, coming and going as needed. I was contacted almost daily by Eitan or Genesis Millan from the office to make sure I knew what was the plan for the day.  There were inspections at each stage of the project  and we still came in under the original time frame given.  I am so pleased with the  professionalism of the everyone who was a part of the remodel, the quality of the workmanship and the beauty of both bathrooms."
5,"We are very pleased with the way our fireplace wall looks .
Each phase of the project was done by workers who were skilled and experienced. 
They did their job quickly and always made sure the room was kept clean.
The project was unique and changes the appearance of the whole room. 
We would recommend David Eskin our project manager and Horizon Construction & Remodeling Inc to anyone thinking of Remodeling any room in their house"
5,"My wife, Kathy and I back in late July contacted three contractors to provide us an estimate to remodel our bathroom’s toilet and shower area.  Eitan Beznos provided us, what we felt was the estimate and help.  For this remodel, we were under somewhat of a time constraint to try and complete the project by 9/3.  
Eitan’s crew started demolition as promised on the day as promised.  Eitan had Ron, and George come in for the rough framing, electrical and plumbing, which was completed within the first week along with the Hot Mopping.  Ron and George and the hot mop person did an incredible job completing on schedule or even ahead of schedule.
The main impact to the remodel, was from the city inspection crew.  While we were delayed a week before we could tile the shower and the floor, Eitan and Ron had their tiling crew work the Labor Day Weekend to try and catch up, which again we were held up for city inspection. Further delaying completion.  George came in to perform the finish work, even coming in late in the day, I am sure after putting in a full day on another job.  The custom shower doors that have been installed are beautiful. 
We have had numerous construction jobs performed over the years, (pool installation, patio install, room additions, etc) and Eitan was always available either by phone or coming by to check, and everyone who worked on the remodel was friendly, professional, always cleaned up and tried to help minimalize the impact of dust, smell and noise as much as possible.
I will definitely look to Horizon for any further work."
5,"I met with David Eskin from Horizon Construction; he was very friendly and professional.  We discussed the projected and my expectations.  Within a few days, David had the estimate ready and we met for a second time.  When we met to review the proposal, David went through everything in detail.  

A few days later, I called David and told him that I would like Horizon to be the contractor for my project.  We then agreed on a starting date.  I told David I would be out of the country during the beginning phases of the project.  He assured me that wouldn’t be a problem and would keep me posted throughout the process.  

I really enjoyed going to their showroom to pick out the materials for the project, I felt like a kid in a candy store.  David was there through that process as well and offered suggestions if asked.  

Everything went smoothly for the most part throughout the process.  Some issues came up regarding the electrical panel, this was no fault of David’s, and he was quick to resolve the issues.  David was always quick to respond to my text messages or emails to address any questions or concerns I might have had.  

For the most part, the project came out better than anticipated.  Everyone who was involved with this project was always kind, courteous and eager to assist.  

Thank you, Horizon!!!

5,"We were very happy with the work done by Horizon
Construction on our remodeling project. We love our 1954
suburban home, but the two bathrooms were in serious need
of updating. Horizon started work and we immediately knew
we were in good hands. The workmanship on the floor and
shower tile was superb. In our master bath we had custom tiles
installed in the shampoo shelf that made our shower really
shine. The workers in charge of painting, vanity installation
and plumbing were very friendly and professional. We felt
very comfortable having them in our house. They answered
questions and communicated their progress to us. The overall
job was done in a timely manner and we were always informed
of any delays.
David the project manager kept us updated throughout the
entire process and helped us to realize our vision of a
southwestern style guest bathroom. He took care of all the
paperwork with our city's permit process. We were given
notice of any delays and he responded to texts immediately.
On one occasion, while we were shopping for vanities at a local
warehouse, he texted with us for over half an hour to make
sure we got the right one. Halfway through the project we
decided to re-pipe our entire house and David made that
happen. His plumbing crew had the re-pipe done in two days.
We feel confident recommending Horizon for your remodeling
needs. They respected our house and it showed in their work.
We can't wait to show off our new bathrooms to friends and
family!"
5,"We wanted to remodel for a long time.  Had interviewed several contractors. We didn’t know anyone here.  When we met David from Horizon we felt safe. He understood our vision and helped us clarify it. We liked that Horizon is 1 stop destination with a showroom, this is truly helpful in this process. We chose David Eskin with Horizon Construction and Remodeling, Inc. to and it turned beautiful. We Loved All horizon workers.  We had few communication glitches but those were resolved right away. David did a great job keeping his cool and listening to all our questions and concerns and was on top of it right away ready to explain and resolve. 
My only feedback will be in this area - to try and explain the clients more so less questions will arise. 
Overall we are very satified with our new kitchen and 2 new bathrooms and recommend Horizon construction and remodeling in Fullerton CA 
to others !"
5,"I contracted Horizon to do a remodel of a portion of the house that converted an old bedroom and master/bathroom, into a modern master with a large bedroom and guest bathroom. The initial budget was doubled what was targeted due to many unexpected expenses (some due to my request, others due to lack of foresight in planning).

The workmanship was of good quality generally but there were areas where attention to detail was not taken. 

The customer service has been the best part of working with Horizon. When problems arose with plumbing down the line, the company was responsive and helped fix the issue and even help with one that was due to the fixtures. They also did not charge for small minor requests (swapping faucet on an unrelated portion of the house).

Overall, I would say that the experience is positive."
5,"Horizon Construction recently completed a fireplace remodel in my home.  This was our first attempt at any major work here.  They were very professional and did a great job.  There were times when they had to work around my schedule and times when workers remained until evening to finish a project.  
I appreciate the prompt responses I received from Mike and the office staff when I had questions. He made good suggestions and had explanations about the process.  As in another review, the cost was significant for a one-wall redo, but I’m very happy with the result.  
There’s a small adjustment needed in the recessed lighting, but I’m confident this will be finished soon.  Overall, I think they were professional and easy to work with."
5,"While searching for a quartz counter top to coordinate with my existing beige flooring, I discovered Horizon.  They had what I wanted and secured a backsplash with a mosaic to complete the color scheme. Mark is a hands on contractor-owner .  He oversees every step of the job and there is little down time in the process.  The workers willingly try to accommodate customer requests.  If an installation is not satisfactory, it is corrected.  Horizon does an excellent job for the price charged. 

Arlene Hoskins"
4,"After poor experiences with previous contractors, we came into our next home repair project with reservations and a long check-list of characteristics we wanted in our next contractors, including responsiveness, professionalism, expertise, and follow-through.  Horizon was one of the half dozen businesses we solicited.

If cost was the only factor, Horizon would not have been selected.  While the company provided discounts, its estimate was triple the lowest bid and thousands more than another contractor we were considering.

We met Rey and Omri, and we were impressed with the way they addressed our concerns and exuded pride in the company’s reputation for high customer service and satisfaction.

We got what we paid for:
• Jobs were completed as scheduled (or there was sufficient communication and transparency during the few times complications arose).
• Horizon was responsive, both in its communication and follow-through with requests.
• Workmanship and attention to detail was excellent.
• The company handled minor incidental items without charging us extra.
• Half a year later, we contacted the business about a warranty issue.  • The company was prompt in its response, and the problem was fixed within a few days.

It is evident Horizon values maintaining positive relations with its customers.  If price is not the sole determinant, we recommend the company and will continue to keep it at the top of our list for future remodeling projects."
5,"I bought a house last year and worked with David to remodel the kitchen, master bathroom and guest bathroom. David was professional and had great design ideas. He designed the layouts and helped me selecting the materials for the kitchen and the bathrooms. The transformation was amazing. The open floor plan between the kitchen and the family room makes the house looks incredible expansive. The projects were finished on time and passed all the inspections. The final results were exactly as my vision of my house should be!"
4,"As is common with many construction projects, we experienced several issues and it took longer than originally planned. However, David and Mark addressed and corrected all issues, even ripping out and starting over on several items when necessary. Despite the issues and timing delays, Horizon did come in on budget, and we absolutely love the new bathrooms and bedroom floor!"
5,"Horizon construction built a bathroom for me in my detached recreational space. The room was transformed from a simple and basic recreational room into a livable and enjoyable space that is perfect for single travels or couples looking to stay in a comfy and welcoming space while visiting our lovely state of California. David and his construction team finished the job in just over a month, on budget and on time. I would recommend Horizon construction to others looking room additions or things similar to what we had done to our home."
5,"I found Horizon Construction on the Houzz app after several attempts to connect with a few other contractors. I sent an email on a Sunday and got a response the following Monday. The great communication with Horizon continued through my entire project of a complete remodel of my kitchen, guest bathroom and walk in closet. They also installed all new windows and tile flooring. My project manager was David and he was the best, made himself available to me for all of my many questions and decisions even while he was on vacation! Working with Enna and the others at the office were perfect as well. I couldn’t be more pleased with the outcome of my remodel. 

Best Regards,
Debbie Karmelich"
5,Thank you Horizon for all your help making our guest/additional bathroom for my mother who recently moved in with us a place she loves.  David was very kind and understanding of what we wanted and the crews that came to work were very professional.  We look forward to having additional work done in our house by Horizon so all of our rooms can be just as beautiful.
5,"Horizon did a terrific job on a complete makeover of our master bathroom (including the shower, jacuzzi, flooring, counter-tops, sinks, and cabinetry) and the replacement of all kitchen cabinetry, drawers, and sink.  This was a big project for us -- so it was important to select a contractor who was reliable, had all the right skill sets, and was committed to quality.  Horizon delivered on all fronts with flying colors!

We found Horizon through Angie’s List.  After reading comments on Angie’s List and on many other web sites such as BBB and Yelp, we decided to get estimates from Horizon and three other service providers.   After our initial interview with each prospective provider, we concluded that Horizon provided the most comprehensive services at pricing that was very competitive.    

Our project involved a variety of skillsets including woodworking, plumbing, electrical, tile installation, fabrication and cutting of counter-top surfaces, and finishing and painting.  Rather than hiring a jack-of-all trades, Horizon delivered highly skilled craftsmen in each field who completely embraced Horizon’s expectations for quality.

Our Horizon project manager David was instrumental to the success of our project.  David did a great job coordinating and supervising the work of each of the craftsmen.  David was very responsive and easy to reach when questions arose.  David was on site regularly to inspect progress and assure that the craftsmen met Horizon’s high expectations for quality.  On occasions when David noted items requiring special attention, the craftsmen were eager to respond.  David was also very responsive and attentive to all observations we shared as the project progressed.  It was clear that the craftsmen all shared Horizon’s deep commitment to quality.  The craftsmen were also very courteous and productive throughout the duration of our project.  

We are very pleased with the end-product and the process Horizon followed from start to finish (including design suggestions and assistance with surface material selections).  Thank you very much to all of the Horizon project team (including the back-office team) for a job well done! 

We wholeheartedly recommend using Horizon and will most certainly use Horizon for any projects we undertake in the future."
5,"(Originally written about 3.5 months after job completion).  I must admit that we were highly cautious with our next bathroom remodel hire. Reason being was a previous contractor abandoned our master bathroom remodel after attempts to have them address valid concerns. That other contractor's license was eventually suspended after multiple consumer complaints were filed. Thankfully, working with Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc on addressing a previous contractor's mess ups and then completing a redo of another bathroom in our home was a much better experience. The new remodel job that was Horizon's from start to finish was completed in a timely manner. With our older house, there were issues uncovered after the demo process that were not too much of a surprise. The issue extended our timeline and did add somewhat minor costs to the job. When questions or concerns were raised, Mike Roppo, our project leader, was responsive to address issues and provide explanations before the job moved forward. I must state that some of the worksite conditions at the end of a couple jobs were not ideal. For example, white residue was left on our hedges and some of our walkway from workers mixing materials - possibly grout. Also, workers left cigarette butts in our newly installed small rocks landscaping that couldn't just get swept out easily. Workers did clean up nicely for all interior jobs. Finally, after completion of both bathrooms, two more events occurred. First, Horizon came out and made repairs that surfaced, like settling cracks in the grout for example. This was part of their contract, but it was done in a timely fashion. Second, Horizon was helpful with our complaint to the contractor license board by providing a statement of the condition of the bathroom remodel that was abandoned. Overall, we would include Horizon on our list of contractors to work with again."
5,"Sounds corny but it is true – When you deal with Horizon Construction & remodeling, you are treated like family. 
It’s my last major project and I have been putting it off for many years. Life happened and it is never the right time to remodel. But, we are glad we finally did it!
 They are very patient people and never made me feel indecisive despite the fact that I am. I doubt there are many firms in the entire country that are genial and comfortable and just plain nice. Also, they explain everything in as much or as little detail as you want and all those details are laid out in an organized and thorough fashion. Everyone there is super professional. They are a treasure.
Love my new house !
Thank you Horizon Construction and remodeling"
5,"We were impressed with everyone we interacted with at Horizon, especially our contact person named Mike.  They finished the project before estimated time and there were no extra charges for anything!  We would recommend this company to our family and friends."
5,"Frequently a home renovation is not for the faint-of-heart. There are countless general contractors to choose from, some first-rate and some unscrupulous, and which one to hire is often the biggest unknown factor in a successful execution of transforming an idea into fruition. In my case I could not be happier. Mark Besnos, his wife Enna and all the team at Horizon were absolutely the best. Having done many a previous renovation on properties over the years, I can truthfully say that Mark's diligence and demand for perfection overseeing my project is something I've seldom witnessed before. He is more than a simple ""hammer and nails"" contractor: Mark is a symbiosis of one part architectural engineer with the aesthetic eye of an interior designer. With his immense help we were able to harmoniously blend the various colors of granite, travertine tile, cabinetry and backsplash, updating a tired mid-century ranch home kitchen into a Tuscan showplace."
1,"Horizon Construction & Remodeling in 2018 lied about getting City inspections done, damaged my home and covered up the damage, and left dangerous conditions throughout my home, leaving myself and my family at risk. For example, just some of the things Inspectors found: sharp roof shingles unattached on my roof which could have fallen and cut us; they left exposed electrical wiring in the attic = potential fire danger; extremely hot pipes not insulated, which could have burnt us, and more. The City is making me remove construction Horizon did because they lied about getting approval. DO NOT HIRE THEM. They are a dangerous company. They also gave a portion of the remodel to another general contractor (not as a subcontractor) without my approval.  Horizon Construction (Mark Besnos) did not supervise this other contractor, who’s license has been suspended and is being prosecuted by the California Attorney General’s Office. All of this can be confirmed.  This was a big project and Horizon Construction & Remodeling took my money and have left my entire family devastated by the amount of damage they did to our home."
5,"We just completed our remodel of two bathrooms with Horizon Construction. We are very happy with the final product. The work was completed on a timely basis with great communication regarding scheduling, problem solving and attention to any issues that came up. We did have a few issues that needed some attention, but they were completed to our satisfaction. I was very nervous when we first started the project because I am very detail oriented and was afraid the work  might not meet our expectations- but it most certainly does. 

David was our project manager and always responded back to any issues that came up on a very timely basis- always available via phone or email, even on weekends. The office staff was equally responsive, and that made this project so much easier to deal with. 

We did have a little delay due to the rainy weather over the last couple of months, but other than that, someone was here working pretty much every day since our project started the first week of January . 

 Very happy with our choice of Horizon and highly recommend them for your remodeling needs."
5,"We chose Horizon Construction & Remodeling for our project.    They are a family owned business that provides outstanding customer service.  Our project was a kitchen and living room remodel.  Our home was built in the early 50’s with the center piece of the home being an indoor bar-b-que taking up most of one wall of a very small kitchen and a massive fireplace in the living room.  After weeks of delays and concerns from the city, an engineer and architect from Horizon were brought in to help finalize plans.  The final decision was to remove the massive brick structure.  The kitchen and living room were gutted, fireplace and bar-be-que demolished and a new wall was constructed.   We especially liked that everything we needed was on display at their showroom and the staff was extremely patient and helpful as we make our choices.  Throughout the remodel our project manager, David, and the office staff kept us informed as to what was happening and who was coming to work the next day.  Each day the crew working cleaned up and did not leave a mess.  David, Enna, Genesis and the office staff were always very professional and constantly checking as to how we were doing since we stayed in the home throughout the remodel.  We are extremely pleased with the job done for us by Horizon Construction &Remodeling and we highly recommend them.
Rick and Sandy Lewis"
5,"The team at Horizon Construction & Remodeling has given us the master suite of our dreams! My wife and I love our mid-century house, but the master bathroom left a lot to be desired. Our project manager, Mike, helped us maximize the space by borrowing from a largely unused kitchenette area and was able to include every single one of the custom cabinets, appliances, and fixtures we set our hearts on. Now we have a luxurious, spacious bathroom and a lovely bar area with plenty of storage that will be excellent for entertaining guests. Although there are always some complications in a remodel this large, the whole process went very smoothly and Horizon took care of us at every step - we were always left feeling our home was in the best hands. Thank you so much for helping us fall in love with our house all over again!"
5,"From the very first phone call I made to Horizon I felt valued as a client. The office staff was always kind and helpful. Our project manager, David, was easy to work with and was always responsive to any questions or concerns. He stopped by frequently to check the progress throughout the project and kept us informed of the next phase and work scheduling. All the tradesmen involved were professional, respectful of our home, great to talk with and did an excellent job. Any remodeling project can be stressful, but I believe that the service we received from Horizon made the process as smooth as possible.  We love our beautiful new kitchen and bathroom. I would highly recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling for any home project and would certainly use them again."
5,Mark Besnos and his crew at Horizon Construction and Remodeling did an awesome job on all of my remodel projects in my home. I especially like that if there is something that you don’t quite like they will fix it for you right away. I recommend them because I love how everything turned out and I will use them again for my next project!
5,"Horizon Construction did an awesome job on our Kitchen Remodel.  We put off remodeling for so many years but upon reading all the good reviews on this company we finally decided it was time.  The outcome was exactly how I envisioned it.  David, our project manager, as well as everyone in the office were always available to help us with any little (or big) question or concern.  We were always told what to expect at each stage and all the contractors were very professional and always kept the work area clean each evening.  All deadlines where met as scheduled and no ""surprise"" costs were incurred.   Thank You Horizon Construction and Remodeling"
5,"I interviewed multiple contractors to complete a full bathroom remodel for 3 bathrooms.  I ultimately chose Horizon because I knew they would be the right fit for the project I was undertaking.  They are a small family owned business that has the customer’s satisfaction in the forefront of their minds.   We agreed that we would complete the project in two phases.  We completed a hall and master bathroom remodel first with the third bathroom to take place after the first of the year.  
Both Horizon and their subcontractors are available to answer questions and assist with any decision making you may need or ideas to make your project have an outcome that you are 100% satisfied with.  The workmanship, timeliness and cleanliness of each subcontractor was impeccable.  I would highly recommend Horizon for your next remodel."
4,"I started this bathroom remodel with a different contractor - but it didn’t go well. So I hired Horizon Construction & Remodeling and my bathroom is absolutely stunning. I will recommend them to friends and family. David my project manager was great, he always assured me that all will be taken care for me and I actually could sleep good at night. And I did ! I’m very happy ! 
Any questions that come out were addressed in a very timely manner. 
Which made me feel very comfortable. 
Now the project is complete it looks absolutely wonderful beyond my expectations 
My family and I really love it!"
5,"I interviewed three contractors and chose Mark Besnos and Horizon for an extensive interior remodel of my home – master bedroom and bath, guest bathroom, kitchen.  The project included removing a soffit ceiling in about half the house, installing a new support beam to eliminate a post, wainscoting in the living and dining room, hardwood flooring in the renovated areas (except the bathrooms), two new windows, and a new fireplace mantel.  Mark wasn’t the least expensive but based on his experience and our discussion I felt he would be “hands on” and would provide guidance during the course of the project.  Mark has excellent taste.  He was patient and worked with me and my cousin (who was consulting with me) very well.  He was earnest in trying to accommodate his visits to my work schedule.  A project of this magnitude is bound to encounter some challenges, and Mark was good at explaining them and presenting options, while giving me time to reflect.  The various trades who worked on my home were top notch, and when there were some issues Mark immediately took steps to correct, fix, re-do, what needed to be done. An example is the flooring.  There was a haze on the floor and Mark contacted the manufacturer and called in and paid (at his expense) a professional to inspect the floor and make recommendations.  Mark and his team were always on top of things, communicating often via email (my preference) and also texts.  The end result has exceeded my expectations.  I am thrilled with my new, open concept, home.  The kitchen is amazing, the fireplace is a focal point, and I absolutely love my master bathroom.   We had some fun with the guest bathroom as well.  Now I need artwork!  Bottom line . . . if someone leaves me a house in his or her will and I have to remodel it, I’m calling Mark and Horizon."
5,We love Horizon. We wanted to do an exterior remodel and contacted them. They were there every step of the way and always available when we had questions. They were on time and kept to their schedule. They constantly kept us updated on the project. Mark is great...he listened to what we were thinking and helped make it reality.  We really liked that Mark let’s you know if there are any problems and helps come up with solutions. They take care of their customers!  Enna was also amazing and was always available to answer questions. We will use them again for our next project!
5,Horizon did a wonderful job with our kitchen. They were clear communicators all along the way and went the extra mile to accommodate our requests. We love our new kitchen!
5,"My wife and I made the decision to completely remodel our 55 year old kitchen which included removing a couple of walls to open it up to the dining room and living room. After deeply vetting numerous contractors and securing proposals, we selected Horizon Construction in Fullerton, CA. Mark Besnos, company owner, was by far the most detail oriented and considerate home improvement contractor we’ve ever worked with. Throughout all phases of the project, Horizon provided extraordinary workmanship in a very timely manner. Of course with any major project there are a few challenges. Horizon Construction remedied every issue with effective contingency plans for any problem they encountered.  Here is an excellent example of superior service: We selected and ordered quartz counter tops from MSI of Orange, CA.  When the quartz counter tops arrived and were installed, they had a number of finishing defects which Horizon tried to repair. Unfortunately, the defects were irreparable and MSI would not stand behind their product and workmanship. Mark and Horizon Construction however alleviated our aggravation by selflessly offering us a partial financial reimbursement even though the counter top finishing was not Horizon’s responsibility. 
From beginning to completion, Horizon Construction exhibited professionalism, pride of workmanship and a commitment to excellence. If you are seeking the finest company to successfully bring your remodeling dreams to reality, Horizon Construction is unquestionably the one!"
5,"We were referred to Horizon Construction from a neighbor that had recently hired them for a bathroom & kitchen remodel.  Although Horizon’s was quote was higher than previous quotes, we went with them based on the quality of workmanship we saw in my neighbor’s home plus their great online reviews. 
The first couple of weeks went well. We were told the job would take 4-5 weeks to complete. The first round of workers and inspector were on schedule. Around week three things slowed down.  The tile guy only worked between 3-5 hours a day. We ran into a couple problems with paint that resulted in “do-overs”.  Some of the mistakes made by the painters were somewhat novice. However our project manager was quick to respond and correct the issues. The job was completed at the end of week five.
At the end, our experience with Horizon Construction was a great one. The office staff and project manager were pleasant and attentive to our concerns.  We are happy with the work done in our bathroom and would consider using them again in the future.  I highly recommend Horizon Construction to anyone looking to do a remodel/construction in their home."
5,"It went great! Enna ,David and the entire Horizon Group were a pleasure to work with. Expectations clearly communicated and met. Trades arrived when scheduled, on time and prepared. The few problems that came up were quickly resolved to our satisfaction. We are planning further work next year and will use Horizon Construction and Remodel again. We have full confidence that we will be treated as fairly and professionally as we were on this project"
5,"We contracted with Horizon Construction and Remodeling to remodel all three of our bathrooms.  Mark, Enna and the administrative staff were fully involved throughout the project providing updates, schedule reminders and addressing all of our concerns along the way.  While we were upgrading the two upstairs bathrooms, we had a family of 5 sharing a downstairs shower.  Mark was good about keeping the project moving forward and getting us use of the upstairs bathrooms as soon as possible.  During the demo work, we uncovered bathtub rust.  Mark covered the options and was able to work in the schedule a replacement with a project quick change order.  We also decided midflight of the remodel that the existing cabinets were not going to work.  Mark once again was able to provide options for us to address within our timeframe and budget.  As during any remodel big or small, issues and challenges will arise.  Mark and the whole Horizon team went out of their way to make sure my wife and I were extremely pleased with the process and end results.  We very much appreciated the communication, periodic onsite morning meetings and the breakdown of payments spread throughout the 4 month project that allowed us a little more control of the finances.  Overall, we appreciated the honesty, upfront discussions, and their dedication to details to make our bathrooms beautiful.  We would not hesitate to contract with them again.  Thank you Mark, Enna and the whole Horizon Construction and Remodel team."
5,"I have been wanting to remodel my kitchen for several years and the opportunity finally presented itself.
Horizon was recommended to me by my neighbor so I decided to include them in the process of choosing a contractor.
All of the contractors provided about the same cost to do the remodel but my final decision went to Horizon. 
I choose Horizon to do the job because first impressions do matter and Horizon impressed me with their professional manner and responsiveness. 
When the job started I was again pleased with the scheduling and notifications I received from Enna and Genesis. Like most people, I am a busy person and I like to be informed and prepared. Being kept in the loop about the activity at my home was very helpful and appreciated.




During the remodel process my home and garage were cleaned up and neat when I arrived home, always a welcome sight! The kitchen was completed before the scheduled end date which was a great surprise. But most of all the kitchen is gorgeous! The workmanship is beautiful and the I couldn't be happier with the result! I would definitely recommend Horizon to anyone wanting or needing to start a construction project!"
5,"We want to thank Horizon Construction & Remodeling, Inc. 
Especially Enna & David for our BEAUTIFUL  makeover kitchen.
They were really helpful in helping us select our cabinets, counter tops and backsplash and the color combination for our kitchen.
David was great! 
He was here and checked each phase of the work and made sure all work was done satisfactory.
the workers were great in their preparation and cleaning up before leaving.
Thank you again Horizon, we are very pleased with the work done!"
5,"You can feel comfortable hiring Horizon Construction and Remodeling for your next house project!  I had to do lots of repair and maintenance on my Queen Anne Victorian home and Project Manager Mike and the folks at Horizon came through with flying colors.   I replaced the roof, cleaned and re-insulated the attic, added new floors upstairs, upgraded some electrical, repaired plater ceilings and painted the exterior with a three color ""Painted Lady"" look for the house.  All the sub-contractors were polite, fine craftsmen and always on time. Mike was great communicating  with me at all times.  This situation has not always been true for contractors I've interviewed to work on my house.  Usually, they come to the house, say they will give me an estimate, and never call back.  Horizon and their team did  high quality work on a difficult older home."
5,"Horizon Construction and Remodeling recently remodeled my kitchen and I highly recommend their work.  They completed my project on time and on budget.

Our project manager, Mike, was a positive force from beginning to end.  Anytime I texted him he answered back right away, every time.  He was always on top of things and very sensitive to any concerns I might have.

The staff at Horizon was also great.  They kept me informed every step along the way as to what was going to be done next.  Each day after work was completed the workers left the area extremely clean.  They never left a mess at any time which I appreciated.

It was a remarkably stress free remodel and the results were exactly as I had envisioned.  I will definitely use them again for any project in the future."
5,"I chose Horizon to do a complete kitchen remodel, add an additional 100 square feet and create a 9’ pass through between the kitchen and family room.  This entailed major construction – engineering, demo, footings, support beams, framing, insulation, electrical, plumbing, paint, floor tile, cabinets, countertops, and installing appliances.  
 
Mark Besnos, the owner, was the project manager and Enna and Genesis (back office) provided education and guidance throughout the entire project.  The approximate timeline given was three months; it was finished in two months.  Mark worked with me in building the kitchen in stages to ensure I was able to stay within my budget. 
 
Mark made suggestions along the way (which I appreciated) – I agreed with some and others I didn’t.  For instance, during construction, he prompted me to think about raising the ceiling – I’m very thankful I agreed with his recommendation – it worked out well.  There was never any pressure to do anything I didn’t want to do. 
 
Communication is always the key to success.  I was always aware of the next steps.  Whenever I had questions, Mark or Enna promptly answered.  They even answered questions and concerns while they were on vacation – they are dedicated to their profession. There were some small concerns or issues along the way – they were addressed and resolved in a timely manner which was greatly appreciated.
 
This has been an educational and rewarding experience.  A lot has to do with the relationship established with the client.  The Besnos family (Mark and Enna), from the beginning, have been friendly, patient, honest and trustworthy.
 
I now have a beautiful dream kitchen to enjoy with family.  Thank you Mark and Enna."
5,The Horizon team did an OUTSTANDING job at my home. We had a bathroom remodel which they basically completely redesigned and it looks absolutely amazing!!! So happy with the outcome and service!
4,"We searched on all popular web sites to look for a recommended contractor.  Horizon beat out other companies and we met with Mark, the owner.  I explained to Mark what we were wanting and looking for.  Horizon was very timely and on task.  They always kept me in the loop of what I needed to do and what they were going to work on.  When I changed some of the design or wanted tile to be redone, Mark came right over and addressed the issues.  I liked how all of the workers cleaned up after themselves as well. All of Horizen’s employee’s were professional and friendly. Our kitchen looks great and functions so much better.  Our kids want to cook too.  Thank you Horizon."
5,"Our dream to remodel our kitchen began a couple of years ago.   We interviewed contractors but none worked out or followed up with us.   We began to again search in the summer of 2017 and met with Mark of Horizon Construction as well as with other contractors.  We were especially impressed when we visited the Horizon  office to see cabinets and other materials.  Also, we were very impressed by Ena and the staff.   Mark had great ideas and helped us design a new kitchen for us. Work began in mid November (due to our schedule)  and progressed well with workers showing up on time almost every day.  Work included demolition, replacing all cabinets with granite tops and tile backsplash, creating an island with a sink which involved moving plumbing, widening of the doorway between the kitchen and dinning room, enclosure of a preexisting sliding door,  new floors in the hallways, kitchen and dining rooms and creating a new gas line and venting exhaust for the new range and other electrical upgrades.   The work progressed smoothly despite a few bumps in the road.  Mark made certain all work was done to his high expectations.   Ena and the office staff were always available to answer our questions.  Inspections went smooth and quickly.   The job was completed on schedule and to our satisfaction.   We highly recommend Horizon Construction and will not hesitate to call on them again for future projects."
5,"The complete remodel of one of our bathrooms was just completed by Horizon Construction last week. The bathroom is gorgeous. I could not be happier. The project manager, David, was constantly on top of the scheduling and progression of the work. He visited almost every day to make sure everything was going to plan and always asked if we had any questions or problems. Any issues that came up were immediately addressed. Compared to many contractors I have dealt with, the communication was wonderful.  The quality of the work was top notch and the various tradespeople (plumbers, electricians, painters, tile-setters, etc.) were all very pleasant and helpful. They were always on time per the schedule or if there was a delay, we received a timely e-mail and re-schedule time. The job was completed on time per the original promise date. The clean up at the end of the job was professionally done. I would highly recommend Horizon Construction for any remodeling job."
5,"Horizon construction and remodeling Inc. did our whole home meaning total kitchen remodeling (cabinets tile counters lighting), upstairs bathroom (tile flooring and vanity), all trim molding crown molding, wall repair, texture coat, painting everywhere, stairway new banister, carpet, vinyl plank flooring, back/ front doors, all electrical with new lights/ ceiling fans and interior doors. What a Beautiful job!! We couldn't be happier!! Kitchen looks like a model in a show room. The whole house is such a transformation that we feel like we're on vacation!! Mark and his workers were on time and so courteous. Horizon show room makes it so easy to pick out your products and it's not confusing. We would with no hesitation recommend Horizon  for All your remodeling needs inside and outside of your home. Thank You to All the Horizon work team!! 

Sent from my iPhon"
5,"Great service and professional workers! The company contractor and team were prompted on time, answered all the questions I had and performed the remodeling project in proficiency! Definitely recommended!"
5,"We met Horizon Construction & Remodeling Representative after meeting 2 other contractors and we must say we liked Horizon a lot.
The project manager was very knowledgeable and personable
He listen to us and made good suggestions and was always available for us
we honestly couldn't do this project without him!
It took longer than we planned because the remodel was done around the holiday season but it was worth it! The END product is beautiful 
We receive many compliments from family & friends
We appreciate the hard work - all workers were very dedicated and talented
We will spread the GOOD WORD ABOUT HORIZON!!!"
5,"We love the new bathroom! The old bathroom was cramped, damp and colored pink (the house was build in 1957). The only venting was the window. My father requires a full time caregiver and there was barely enough room in the bathroom for one grown man let alone two. Mark came up with an excellent floor plan and matched his ideas with our hopes and wishes. The bathroom was completely gutted. The plumbing for the shower (with shower head and hand shower) was added and the plumbing for the toilet and the vanity sink was moved. Three areas of lighting were added--over the vanity, over the toilet, and in the shower. A combination venting fan/light was installed. An additional electrical outlet was installed. The bathroom window was replaced. Floor to ceiling tile was installed for the shower as was a channel drain (the shower is 8 feet wide). The project was finished not only on time but 12 days early. The entry into the bathroom and the new shower can now accommodate a person in a wheelchair. Not only is it functional, it's beautiful in its modern palette of neutral grays, tans and creams. All work was professionally done and supervised by Mark. After the project was completed, Mark and Enna called to follow up. When there was an issue with the shower not draining, I made one call and Mark's workers were out the next morning to fix it. This was my first remodel project and on a whole it much better than I had hoped it could be. We are very satisfied and will be hiring Horizon for future projects."
5,"We chose Horizon to refresh the exterior of our home based upon the good ratings in Angie’s List and Houzz.  They were very prompt in setting a time to meet with us.  Leo listened very well to what we wanted to have done and then he walked us through how they would go about getting the job done.  He detailed for us the many steps they would go through to prepare for the work that would need to be done for removing old facade, adding new stucco, painting, adding stone veneer and replacing patio fence.  He explained some of the extra steps they do that others skip, which are important for a long-lasting result.  Leo laid out for us the expected start time and timeline for completion.  Based upon some other estimates that I had received, Horizon’s cost estimate was very reasonable.  Their back-office staff was also very helpful to us in selecting the materials to be used on the job and working with us on scheduling.  Once the job got started, it progressed according to plan, and all city inspections were completed timely without need for any change to the work they had done.  The job was completed to our satisfaction, on time and on budget; they even did a few extra add-ons without charging us anything extra.  Job well done, thank-you!"
5,"Thank you!

Horizon did a great job with my room addition with bathroom and patio.  Now I have a great guest room for when my friends and family come to visit. 

I now start my day on my new patio enjoying my coffee in the shade.  Mike the project manager was wonderful to work with   He was helpful in helping me designing both the interior and exterior layout.  He had a lot of great suggestions and was very knowledgeable.

I will not hesitate to call upon them for any additional work in the future."
5,"Mark and Enna were fantastic!  Mark has an excellent understanding of construction and the realities of renovating a home.  His recommendations reflect his extensive experience and his artistic flare.  We found that by listening to him, his ideas proved to be a better fit than our original ideas.  We are so very glad that we took his advice, especially regarding our kitchen remodel.  Horizon has an entire showroom of materials and other construction examples at their Fullerton location.  This made the selection of materials extremely convenient.  We also found that their material options were of very good quality.  We love the back-splash that we picked out in our kitchen!

When we first met Mark, he was 5 minutes early to our appointment.  Everyone we dealt with after the initial meeting was either early or exactly on time.  We never had to wait for anyone.  When a repair was needed or a concern arose, Enna resolved the matter very quickly, sometimes within the hour.  They were very up front about what was being done and they stayed on budget.  We moved out of our house for 2 months and they had us back in exactly on schedule.  No surprises.  Our home was very outdated and needed some serious attention and that is exactly what we got.  We would hire Horizon Construction and Remodeling again without question."
5,"In October 2018 I met with Mike, Project Manager, from Horizon Construction to do a basic kitchen & wet bar remodel.  He was very easy to work with and explained the process very clearly. Horizon replaced all my cabinets, installed new granite counter tops, backsplash, sinks and faucets, and painted the room. This was to be completed in 4 weeks, but ended up taking a little over 5 weeks as there were issues with some cabinets, backsplash, and minor electrical problems. Every concern or even complaint I voiced was immediately addressed and corrected. They all are focused on providing excellent customer service and making sure their clients are satisfied. Enna, owner, contacted me recently to ask if there was anything else I needed, and this was a month after completion. Cost of the project was within the budget I had allowed and felt their costs are reasonable and competitive. Even with the extra week to complete the project, the result, is a beautiful new kitchen, island and wet bar. I may be remodeling another room and would hire Horizon Construction again as their concern for customer satisfaction stands out…"
5,"Work was done in a timely fashion, and the quality was excellent. Each stage of the project was 
managed well, all workers were punctual and did a good job of cleaning up after work was done. Work 
was completed ahead of schedule and we were very happy with the final results."
4,"Project: Re-pipe whole house and install tankless water heater; replace ducts and install new AC/Furnace unit; remodel two bathrooms.

After speaking to three general construction companies, we decided to hire Horizon Construction for our projects. Their prices were reasonable as compared to the other companies, and we appreciated the detailed written scope of the project that they provided to us. Mark, Enna, and their office staff were very pleasant to work with; they also have a very nice showroom.

Overall, we are happy with how our projects turned out. Enna is great with communications. She always replied to our messages promptly to address our issues and concerns. We did have various issues with the workmanship and cleanliness of some of the trades that came to do the work, which made us felt that the project manager was not always attentive to what was being done at our house. We had to clean up a lot of the messes that were left every night when came home. Horizon could definitely benefit as a company, if they improve their ability to oversee a project more closely to ensure that things are being done properly by their sub-contractors. But, in general, Mark and Enna do care about the satisfaction of their customers. They are committed to making things right. They always made sure that we were happy with the end result. We never felt like Enna or Mark would just ignore us or our concerns. For this reason alone, we would recommend their company to others."
5,"We loved the fact Horizon had a nice showroom where we could find everything we liked. It made all decision process much easier for us. 
Mark Besnos did excellent job, he planned everything very well. The communication was great and easy. Enna Eskin was helpful at office and over emails. We love our new kitchen it is just like we imagined even better ! This is now a perfect summer house for our big family 
Thank you Horizon !"
5,"Well, I wish I had something fun and exciting like a room addition or kitchen remodel to talk about, but our project was just a boring, complicated, extensive repair/renovation. For more than a decade, every time we had a major storm, we got flooding in our family room, and every time we thought we had fixed the problem, when the next storm came, the water re-appeared. We talked to several contractors, and they all had pretty much the same opinion. Since we couldn’t figure our the source or sources of the leaking, the only way to fix it for sure would be to completely remove and replace the stucco and paper from the rear of the house, and replace all the windows. This would also involve detaching and disassembling a large, wood patio cover, and then putting it back together. One contractor didn’t even want to take the job.

We chose Horizon due to a high recommendation from my brother who had used them for a kitchen re-model. The estimate and bid process was quick and smooth, and communication and scheduling with Enna and the office was great throughout. Mark was quick to address the problems, which were many, due to the fact that, as it turned out, our leaks were coming from more than one source.

The quality of the work, for the most part was excellent. In fact, the building inspector commented that the workmanship of the wrapping job was the best he had ever seen. My only complaint is that the work of the window installers was less than stellar, but all-in-all,  the final outcome was good. The color and texture of the stucco also perfectly matches the rest of the house.

We did a water test, and all looks good. We won’t know for sure until the next big storm, but I’m confident that we’ll have a dry family room. so confident, In fact, that we just installed new carpet."
5,Mark and team just finished giving our old house a face lift. Outstanding job! Mark gave us some great advice on how make the house look its best. His input/opinions matched our taste. Mark's attention to details and the quality of the work ensured the outcome was to our satisfaction. We would definitely recommend them and use them again on our next project. (New garage doors are on order...)
5,"After talking to several contractors, we reached out to Horizon Construction for a bid. Mark came out to our house to discuss our project. After talking a while, Mark gave suggestions for changes to the blue prints. It took 7 months with our previous contractor/architect to get the changes made, but they were unquestionably worth the wait. Once we had approval from the city Mark worked us into their busy schedule right away. Mark and his crew worked every day to get our project finished in the timeline they gave us. 
Like most projects there were setbacks, budget changes, and other bumps in the road. However, Mark and his team worked really hard. They did a great job scheduling inspections to keep the job moving. All of the budget changes were because of things we wanted or added not because of his incorrect bid. When issues arose, his office staff was great at contacting us, communicating via phone and email, and answered questions quickly. 
Mark and Enna were a joy to work with, they were punctual, professional, offered good ideas, and allowed us to do some of the work ourselves. Mark is very particular in the way he expects the work to look, he treats his projects likes it is his own place. Mark and Enna always worked diligently to be sure we were happy with the products and services they provided. Despite skepticism from friends and neighbors, Mark was done a few days early. 
We would definitely recommend Horizon Construction to any of our family and friends."
1,"The owner is stuck up and rude. Says he's the owner and is taking his time to come give us an estimate. Says he doesn't do small things and looked like he didn't want to be at our house wasting his precious time. The way he talked and acted throughout the process made me feel like our job was too small for him and we were wasting his time. When I called to book my appointment for a consultation, I was very specific twice about what I needed to be done and asked if our job was too small and the person who setup my appointment said their smallest job was $10k. So he should have already know the job details prior to coming. But when the owner showed up and realized we were small to him he didn't seemed like he wanted to waste his time on us. He quoted me $47k for doing my yard which I had bids from other contractors and the highest bid was $15k. I told him that and he replied that he will hire and attorney and open escrow with $10k and said if I can find someone to do the job for $15k he will give me $10k and if not I need to give him $5k. What he said was unbelievable. I said I'm not going to waste your time anymore and he said EXACTLY and left. On their website it says, ""we are your friendly contractor and want to make it a delightful experience for our customers "". Well, our experience wasn't really delightful and the owner wasn't really friendly! Maybe if I had a million dollar home for him to remodel and the job was hundred of thousands he would've acted and talked differently because he did mention he was working on a $200k pool in Palos Verdes for a $15million home. It's fine if you don't work on small jobs but tell your customers ahead of time instead of coming into their home with no common courtesy.

Thank you for your reply. We did hire someone to do the job. But it’s not the price I’m talking about that is wrong with your company. I’m talking about your owner’s attitude when he came to my house. I think he should at least apologize for that instead of trying to write a response to this review to prove that there was nothing wrong with his attitude and the way he talked to a potential customer. I don’t appreciate it someone that I asked to come give me an estimate to act like the way he did. Thank you for wishing me good luck because I do feel the luckiest part was to not hire your company for the job!"
5,"""We did our research! Horizon construction company was great! The workmanship was beyond our expectations. Our kitchen turned out better then what we thought possible. If you're searching for a construction company for any remodel, give them a call, you will not be disappointed. Thanks to Mike our contractor, he listened to us and gave us great advise.  They even supported us with fixes after the warranty period, just awesome!"""
4,"We were looking around to get a kitchen and bathroom remodel. We met with several contractors but really liked Mike. He was professional, knowledgeable and we liked his design ideas and the quote. 

We ran into unexpected delays from the beginning and that set our timeline back out the gate (asbestos abatement). However, when the project got moving, it took off well. 
There were some other bumps in road that caused delays as well, most were unexpected. 

Overall, we give a four star rating.  Certain aspects of the process were great and others were lacking. 
The office staff was great and tried to be helpful and accommodating. We had been lead to believe that we would have a working toilet and work would be done around it since we only have one bathroom. We had made arrangements for the first few weeks and as we got closer to thanksgiving week and we were aware that little work would be done, it became a problem.  Enna made it work and got the flooring laid and the toilet connected before the holiday. 

The downfall of the process was either scheduling or communication or something.  When we made a change, no matter how big or small, time was added to the timeline. Although technically they finished within the timeline, there were days, on days, on days where little or nothing happened. One day someone came for all of fifteen minutes and then nothing for a week.  We had all the rooms painted and we have never known painting to take so long. The plumber was great. The electrician was great, the framer was great.  They all cleaned up well at the end of the day and the few times it wasn't quite right, Mike was on it and had it taken care of. 
 
Overall we are happy with the end result and would hire Horizon again."
5,"Horizon Construction was such a lucky find for me! I inherited a house from my parents on Balboa Island that was built in 1933. As my parents aged there was a lot of deferred maintenance that needed to be addressed. I had several contractors come and give me estimates and “advice”, but no one took the time like Mike of Horizon Construction did to really find out what I wanted to do and give me realistic quotes.. He was able to preserve the charm and character that the house had, while making it safe and clean with modern amenities. It was a long (8 months+) project, but in that time the quality and care was always there, and my wishes were foremost.  I am happy to give the folks at Horizon Construction “Two Thumbs Up” and would urge anyone wanting a remodel to contact them.

Sincerely,
Suzanne S."
5,"We are happy with the final results of our remodeled kitchen.  Eitan, our Project Manager was the best to work with.  Thank you very much."
4,"Project: Kitchen update: Replaced tile countertops with granite; added backsplash; lowered the bar to counter height and expanded the peninsula.  Installed new sink, induction cook top and downdraft. 

Comments: After talking with other contractors, we chose Horizon Construction who did a nice job with our kitchen update. The workers and project manager were timely, knowledgeable, skilled and neat.  The granite looks awesome and the details around the windows were perfect. The range and the downdraft fit together just right. 

They were fast and completed our project ahead of schedule, a nice plus. It was important to them that we were totally satisfied and when an issue arose, they always had a solution.  We would use them for future remodeling projects."
5,"Nearly 2 years ago Horizon came out and did a major remodel of our downstairs: kitchen, living room, baseboards & flooring, fireplace, etc. It came out beautifully and we were very happy with the results. Recently we were contacted by Horizon again, checking to see how we felt about the remodel at this point. Well, we had a few concerns (cracked cabinet door, uneven drawers, and a crack in the wall where the pantry was installed), which I shared with Enna and within 2 days she had someone out at our home repairing everything, replacing doors, etc. for NO CHARGE! I am impressed by the customer service of this company; its willingness to take care of us so long out from the job was never expected, but definitely appreciated!"
5,"Horizon Construction did a complete  master bath  remodel for me . They did a great job and stayed on schedule . Their attention to detail and finish work was perfect . When  there was a minor  problem Horizon handled it without question . I would highly recommend  and will use them for my next 
remodel needs

5,"Horizon Construction & Remodeling and Eitan the project manager were awesome!
I had several projects done: foundation support, stucco, fascia boards, interior and exterior paint and electrical work. 
All were done professionally and perfectly. 
When unexpected issues arose, they were handled quickly & past expectation !
I would definitely use them again"
5,"Enna, Mark and team did a great job with our full kitchen remodel. We knocked down two walls, did a large support beam and gutted the complete kitchen. Mark suggested we move the sink and re-profile the window, which turned out to be an excellent suggestion. We're very happy with the kitchen and can now entertain without being stuck in a very warm and small ""box"" separated from our guests.

Enna spent a lot of time with us near the end of the project to make sure we were satisfied and that everything was to our liking."
5,The bathroom is beautiful.  It was very stressful and I agonized over each decision.  Mike (project manager) and Robert (contractor) helped with decisions and obtaining materials.  Sol was a great worker.  Mike assured me that everything was fixable when I was catastrophizing.  I had to remind myself of that many times.  I'm so glad it's over!  I would recommend them.
5,"My husband and I are so fortunate to have found Horizon Construction on the Houzz website to help us with our master bathroom remodel.  It was extremely important for us to feel that our contractor was listening, paying attention to detail, and caring about doing a great job.  We got all that in spades in working with Eitan Beznos, our lead designer/contractor, who became a trusted friend through every step of the process.  He consistenty monitored the progress and was in contact with us almost daily to ensure we were satisfied with each installation element along the way, take action to address any problems/issues, update us on what/when to expect next, and offer helpful advice on lingering decisions to be made.  He also even helped find the exact tile from a photo I had shown because he knew it would make us happy not having to settle for something else.  Our design concept for the bathroom really came to life, and it really is a showstopper.  We are amazed at how it looks now and are already planning to contract with Horizon again in a few months for our second bathroom remodel."
5,"Our small, old bathroom was starting to have a lot of issues, so we decided a remodel was in order. We found Horizon Construction online and decided to request an estimate based on the reviews. After our first meeting with Mark, we felt comfortable with him and were impressed with professionalism and attention to detail. Their showroom office had many displays and samples that it made it easier for visual people like me and my wife to envision our design. Our bathroom project had a few twists and turns but Mark was very flexible and committed to customer satisfaction. Mark's workers were easy to work with, and the Horizon Construction staff was kind and willing to help with any questions, issues, or concerns we had. All in all, we are happy we got the bigger bathroom we wanted. I would definitely recommend Horizon Construction for home remodels."
5,"We recently had our master bath remodeled by Horizon Construction.  This was our first experience with a remodel contractor and we didn't really know what to expect.  In our first meeting with Mark he made several suggestions that we decided to go with, such as putting in a light above the tub and adding an electrical outlet on the other side of the sink.  

We really appreciated the fact that Horizon had their own showroom and could make suggestions on combinations of tile, vanities and counter materials.  After going to the big box stores and looking at tile and counter top materials and still not knowing what we wanted we found Mark's input invaluable. 

The workmen all were very good at their jobs.  Steps were taken to protect the floors leading to the bathroom under remodel. Trash was removed in a timely manner.  

There were lots of items we needed to purchase in the first couple of days so that when the walls were rebuilt accommodations could be made for the water supply, drains and electrical.  Decisions had to be made along the way and we answered them the same day, so as to not cause a delay in the schedule.  There were a couple of issues that came up and Horizon addressed them as we went along.  

We were so happy with the result that we hesitated to use the bathroom for a couple of days after completion, we didn't want to mess it up.

Bottom line is we wouldn't hesitate to use Horizon Construction again."
5,"I decided to have a load bearing wall removed, which sounds a lot easier than it is. Horizon was the only company I contacted that didn't waffle on giving me an estimate or insist that I must get ""more"" done in order to be taken seriously.  The office staff was friendly and engaging without being pushy and sales crazy.  I found Eitan Beznos, our assigned contractor, to be friendly,  ethical,  receptive, and always a calming influence in the midst of the project, which , as anyone who's had major construction done  knows, can be a real upheaval of a family's day-to-day life. All the workers involved were pleasant and efficient. I was impressed also by the respect and friendliness between the workers and  Eitan.  I'm very big on customer service, and, to me, a homeowner with a quirky mid century home that needs quite a bit of work, I feel like I've found a reputable company that I can trust and partner with to turn my home into the neighborhood jewel that it can be. I'm looking forward to having Horizon remodel my kitchen later this year."
5,"When i decided to redo my kitchen, i was very nervous about who to hire and trust to do the work.
I'm an older widow with NO experience in all of this. 
after quite a few interviews, well, there was no other choice. 
It was HORIZON CONSTRUCTION & REMODELING all the way.
Michael R. was my project manager and really listened to me and was so helpful in all ways.
Robert and his crew was great. He was always there for me, a giant of a guy in all ways.
I couldn't be happier. They finished in 9 days
AND the price was reasonable. 
It turned out beautiful !
I highly recommend HORIZON!!!

5,"I had a bathroom and bedroom remodeled by Horizon. They were reasonable on the overall cost when compared to other quotes obtained. Eitan Beznos did an excellent job overseeing this project. He expressed a sense of care and always wanted to make sure I was pleased with the work before moving on. Overall, the workmanship was excellent and I was always guided to make the best decision possible on material and installation. Their workers were courteous and knowledgeable. Horizon left both rooms looking immaculate and ready for me to move back in. The end result of this project surpassed my expectations with the project completing on time. I highly recommend Horizon for any home project."
5,"Horizon Construction did a beautiful job on our remodel.  Our our family and friends are raving about the difference between before and after.  There so many nice touches that Mark incorporated in the remodel such as the backsplash in the kitchen and including different stone.  The crew were professional, diligent, hard working and
cleaned up after themselves every day.  Mark was flexible and willing to work on any issue without any complaint.  He is a perfectionist which means he demands high quality from his crew.  He was present during all stages of construction and willing to address any concerns promptly.  I highly recommend him and his team."
5,"Our kitchen and downstairs bathroom in our 30 year old home were beginning to look dated and tired, plus we knew if we tore all down, we’d be able to make better use of the space. We hired Horizon Construction after having interviewed three contractors. We immediately liked Mark Beznos because of his professionalism and seriousness about providing us with the best possible choices regarding layout and design, not to mention that his pricing was reasonable. His initial proposal was very detail oriented and assisted us in approaching all aspects of the project with a good understanding of what would take place. Mark’s crews, from tear down to installation have been on time and easy to work with. They’re efficient and clean up once they have completed their work. Our remodel included not only our kitchen and bathroom, but all of the flooring, baseboards and crown molding in our family room and living room. It’s been a huge project and we couldn’t be more pleased with the result. We have a beautiful modernized downstairs that’s worthy of a professional photo shoot!"
5,"I Found Horizon Construction & Remodeling on line actually for another job but had to shift on the fly when a garage repair issue became more pressing.  Mark came out and reviewed the job with me onsite and followed up with a quote. While not the lowest, I got a good vibe from Mark and chose Horizon for the repair which entailed removing the entire garage floor and much of the underlying soil. The repair looks great and I have received multiple compliments on the completed work. The crews showed up on time and were diligent in their work. Mark and his team are very quick to respond to inquiries which is a big deal to me. I would use them again without hesitation."
5,"I had Horizon install cabinets in my laundry area along with a new sink and also install a ""wet bar"" and media center in my living room.  The quality of the work is excellent and I'm extremely happy. Although my house is small, their work gave it character and everyone that visits comments on how great it looks.  Emma kept me informed the whole way and Mark helped me design everything I wanted.  Thank you!"
5,"We’re writing this review for Horizon Construction & Remolding, Inc. because we found them to be a timely, conscientious and hardworking company that was easy to work with.
The owner Mark Besnos and his staff were very attentive to every detail of our bathroom remodel.
All of the crew members that worked on our bathroom were extremely hard working, always showed up on time and worked long hours to get the job done.
We would highly recommend Horizon Construction for your next construction job.

5,My wife and I are delighted  with our new kitchen.  Horizon did the remodeling in an expeditious and professional  manner.  Their workers were courteous and knowledgeable.  We would highly recommend Horizon to anyone contemplating a remodeling  project.
5,"Horizon Construction completed our remodeling project that involved a full kitchen remodel and structural changes. We could not be more pleased with the results. Mark, Enna, and office staff were highly professional and good communication was made a priority by all. They accommodated all of our change requests.  Mark was mindful that my family was living through the remodel and made efforts to keeping the renovation dust limited to a portion of the house.  The stress of the remodel was lightened by Mark and Enna's empathy and care  as parents of young children as well. Workers sometimes made errors and small damages to areas such as the flooring and walls. Yet with each of these problems, Mark would correct them without question or added charges.  He also took full responsibility for unanticipated problems with the installation of a custom range hood.  In his words: ""I will take care of you.""  In the end, we have a beautiful, high-end kitchen, media room, and more functional laundry room and garage."
4,"Our first home (circa 1951) needed a complete remodel. It had barely been maintained for decades and needed new everything -- plumbing, electrical, HVAC, flooring, windows, doors, etc. We also wanted to update the bathroom, update and expand the kitchen, and remove a load-bearing wall to create an open concept floor plan.

We met with several other shops, and none of them could even envision the finished product or give us a complete estimate. It was a relief when Mike our contractor said at our first meeting, ""Well, the good news is that we can do it all."" And they did. We have been pleased with the overall quality of the work performed, particularly given everything that needed to be done. (The kitchen cabinets, which Horizon supplied, are particularly high quality.) We also appreciated that Mike worked with us to develop a clear pricing estimate, and that other than two unavoidable change orders, the pricing for the job did not change or expand. Horizon allowed us to supply many of our own materials to accommodate our budget as well. (The total price was expensive, but fair, given the short supply of contractors willing and able to do the whole job. We did not have much leverage to negotiate.)

I give Horizon four stars instead of five because we had some communication and timing issues on the job. After we signed the contract in May, the permit submission process was delayed nearly 6 weeks, and while this can be par for the course in some cities, we were not told of the cause for the delay or how the delay was going to impact the project timeline. Instead, we were told and planned on a completion date in early October and were not told until mid-September that the work was actually going to be completed in early November. We had to scramble to extend our temporary lease and find ways to cover the extra costs in our budget.

We also had to push several times for deadlines about what materials needed to be selected and supplied and about payments to be made. We asked for a project timeline, but never received one, and so for several materials, we had to scramble in a day or two to supply them when Mike asked for them ""asap."" Similarly, we offered several times to make progress payments, waited several weeks, and then were asked for large lump sums to cover multiple payments. Both situations caused significant stress.

The lack of a timeline particularly caused some problems when we were selecting a countertop. The pattern we selected was in short supply, and it was not ordered in time for installation before we moved in. To their credit, the owners of Horizon recognized the problem, and they absorbed the cost of a different upgraded countertop, which we appreciated.

And this brings me to my final point -- the owners of Horizon care deeply about their reputation. After they realized some of the timing issues we had experienced, they offered various upgrades to help us get through the rest of the process.

The renovation process is never easy, and frankly, I never want to do it again. But overall, we thought the Horizon crews did a good job."
5,"We were in need of a major master bathroom remodel and were referred to Horizon Construction by a friend who had been extremely please with their master bath remodel.  The owner, Mark, came out on time and gave us many suggestions based on the space we have and an estimate of the cost.  We visited their show room several times to make our selections and were ready to begin.  

The workers all arrived on time and Mark supervised the project from start to finish.  Mark was meticulous in making sure all work was completed to his and our satisfaction.  The result is a beautiful travertine and quartz bathroom that we will enjoy for many years to come.  We highly recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling and will use the company for other remodel projects in the future."
5,"This was my first remodel project and I certainly picked the right company.  A year later I am completely happy with the end result and will use them again.  The schedule was kept and only had 2 change orders which were additional requests from me.  Enna was always in contact with me,  Mark was always available if needed and the trades were all very nice and very professional.  Thank you Horizon Construction .... you have a happy customer!"
4,"I hired Horizon to complete a full remodel of my father’s 3 bedroom/2 bath 1,152 sq. ft. “starter” home (circa 1974) that had never been updated.  Included in the remodel were custom kitchen and bathrooms; new windows and flooring throughout; new A/C and furnace with new ducting; removal of acoustic ceiling; new door (front/fire/closet) replacement throughout; full interior and exterior painting; and updated electrical and plumbing.  The cost:  $95,000.  This amount excludes the cost of all kitchen appliances, vanity/countertops in bathrooms, doors, light fixtures, window coverings, kitchen & bathroom finishes (backsplash tile, cabinet knobs & drawer pulls, sinks, faucets, shower/bath fixtures, mirrors, door handles), new garage door and opener, closet shelving & brackets, as well as required City permits.  

The property was unoccupied throughout the remodel.  Overall, the workmen employed to perform the multitude of tasks involved with this project did a wonderful job!  This was borne out when the house sold 4 days after being listed.  Every showing resulted in comments like “I tried, but I couldn’t find any problems”, “the details were addressed; many remodels miss the mark with the details”, “I’d move in right now if I could!”

As far as the quality of the work goes, I would not hesitate to hire Horizon again.  What I would struggle with, however, are the issues I encountered with project management and administrative matters:

•The project manager I worked with was Mike.  Mike was nice, showed a desire to please his client(s), overall accessible to answer questions, and provided sound and helpful design advice.  Areas where he can improve include writing things down so he won’t forget important issues, reading texts/emails in their entirety to avoid his client’s having to answer questions where information has already been provided in an earlier text/email, and showing more finesse in dealing with a client whose opinion/recollection of events differs with his.  Ultimately, though, Mike’s a good guy and very relatable.
•The front office staff were very pleasant to deal with, and were attentive to issues that arose.  If I had a question, it was usually answered quite promptly.  If I was dissatisfied with something, it was also addressed quite promptly.  Enna (co-owner), Yafa, and Audrey all stand out as being great to work with.  An area that would warrant improvement is the attention to details when it comes to payments.  Client payments should be tracked closely by administration so a client does not have to use their time to provide detailed payment information.

Every construction project will encounter problems and mistakes.  The process has many “moving parts.”  The key factors that helped make this a successful project were that Horizon fulfilled their contractual commitments, took responsibility when mistakes were made, and rectified problems to the satisfaction of their client.

Even after the work was done, and I provided the final sign-off on the project, I encountered an issue that was a result of an understandable mistake on Mike’s behalf.  Enna was so intent on ensuring I was satisfied that she demonstrated her professionalism by rectifying the problem in record time.  She stands by the core philosophy of Horizon Construction & Remodeling to honor their commitment to complete client satisfaction…I appreciate and respect that."
5,"Horizon Construction performed the remodel of  my small master bathroom.  Given the small size, I was expecting any contractor to either price it high or give me second class service.  Horizon did neither.  The price while a bit higher than other bids, was justified by the assignment of a project manager who helped with the design, met me at the home improvement store to pick out the specific tiles and provided exact measurements,  and who provided me with on going supervision of the workers and timely status updates.  

The workers showed up on time and took great care to protect the carpet and the rest of the house.    The work quality was excellent.  I would highly recommend them for the quality of their work.

5,"The project: a kitchen renovation that involved demolishing the old kitchen, building a completely new kitchen in a different location (the old dining area), opening a wall, and building an addition onto the house to add a wet bar

Overall, we had a great experience with Horizon.  They delivered what they said they would, when they said they would, for the price they said it would be.  The work crews were friendly and professional; we were very impressed by their efficiency and the long hours they often worked to complete the project quickly.  As this was our first major renovation, we did sometimes feel some stress about communication (namely knowing when fixtures and decisions were needed from us), but things generally went smoothly.  We are very pleased with the final product and would certainly work with Horizon again."
5,"My wife and I had Horizon remodel two bathrooms at the same time due to a sub floor problem.  The job was performed in a professional ,manner and actually was complete a week early.   The project manager was very professional and assisted us at every step.  Bottom line, I would use this contractor again when the next project arises.  Months after, we required some minor followup repairs and contacted Horizon.  Michael Reppo, the project manager, responded almost immediately.  He came out and inspected and set up the days the crews were to come out and repair.  Really appreciated the prompt and helpful ""AFTER SERVICE"" care given to my wife and I."
5,"This is our 2nd project with Horizon.  First was an awesome kitchen/family room remodel.  This time they did a bathroom remodel, and porcelain tile flooring (living, dining, entry, hall, bath, laundry).  Mark (owner) provided a detailed estimate of cost as well as telling us what our responsibilities were.  There were NO surprise costs.  Mark hires skilled workers (painter, electrician, tile guy, plumber...) who are always on time and polite (no loud talk or radios), able to communicate with me (I speak only English), do meticulous work, and clean up daily before they leave.  Mark is on site almost every day to oversee the quality of work.  Mark and Enna (his wife) are great to work with and responsive to all my texts and emails.  We are going to use Horizon for our next big project (inside staircase redo and new front door).  It's great to have a company you can trust!"
5,Enna and staff are all very helpful. We had a complete demo and remodel of our Master Bath.  It all came out beautifully and could not be happier.
5,"We knew from our experience that this would be a big project, and it would require patience.We needed to remove a weight bearing wall, and reinforce the foundation in three places. This included installing two massive beams in the ceiling to support the roof! This was a Kitchen REBUILD! This old house had the original 1955 yellow tile and linoleum kitchen. We told Mike, our Project Manager that our Prime Concern was the end result. But we wanted him to be as accurate as possible in estimating the start date, and the length of project--and to be HONEST about the predicted time frame. He said they could start in 2-4 weeks as they were so busy--(a good sign). he predicted it would take 3 months to complete, not including holidays. They began within 2 and 1/2 weeks, And they completed our BEAUTIFUL NEW KITCHEN in exactly 3 calendar months which included holidays and weekends!!! We are very happy with the end result, quality materials, and workmanship!!!"
5,"Horizon did a great job with our master bathroom remodel!  We wanted to update the original master bathroom in our home (approximately 20 years old) and they had great ideas to help us realize our goal of a creating a open and modern space.  Their team was very professional, focused on the details, and executed the plan we developed together.  Everyone including the workers, project manager, and owners did a great job.  Thank you Horizon!"
5,"We hired Horizon Construction to demolish our 1950’s kitchen and construct a brand new one. From the beginning they were up front and professional.  We were overwhelmed with all the many choices with design and color.  Since Horizon Construction has a showroom, Mark and Enna were able to help us create the vision we had for our kitchen.  Once the project was underway, we were updated daily by Enna as to when the workers would be here.  We were grateful for their reliability since we were living in our home during the construction. That made this large project much less stressful.  The workers were trustworthy, courteous and respectful of our property.  Throughout the entire project there were only a few issues, as there would be with any project of this magnitude; Mark and his project manager Tal addressed them immediately.  Horizon Construction was a little more expensive than our other bids but you do get what you pay for.  Our kitchen turned out fantastic!  We love it!!"
2,"They came out to bid the job, but when they gave me a price they said that if I did not sign up with them THAT NIGHT then the price would go up by close to 10%, even if it was the following morning.  I explained that I did not do business that way.  Weeks later I asked if they would honor their original price and they quoted me a price that was 15% higher than the original price."
4,"After years of dreaming about remodeling our kitchen, collecting photos from DIY websites and magazines, I was finally able to convince my husband that our 1967 house needed some updating to accommodate our huge family and our hope of “aging in place”. A simple kitchen project became a more extensive downstairs remodel with a new full bathroom and universal shower. We spent months making detailed drawings and lists incorporating what we wanted it to look like. Being life-long DIYers, we entertained the idea of being an owner/contractor but soon realized that the project would involve many structural changes (moving sewer lines, load bearing walls, etc) as well as extensive knowledge of our city’s building codes. In other words, it was beyond our capabilities. We narrowed our search for a contractor to four based on recommendations from neighbors and reviews on the internet, then received estimates and descriptions of the work to be done. Admittedly, we were shocked when all the estimates were almost double what we were anticipating the work to cost… ahh, the price of naivete! While not the least expensive, Mike Roppo, representing Horizon Construction and Remodeling, was the most thorough, knowledgeable and professional of them all.  
Demo started mid-September, final inspection was in mid-February, almost 6 weeks longer than first estimated. We had some glitches and delays along the way:  additional engineering specs, an additional support post, adding a new sheer wall, etc. More time, more money. We were wisely advised to plan on having a 15-20% cushion for unforeseen expenses. Stuff happens!
Electrical, plumbing, framing, drywall, flooring, tile, cabinets, painting, finish carpentry… the crews were great! They all worked hard, cleaned the job site daily, were respectful, communicative-we couldn’t have asked for more from them. Mike was our go-to project manager every step of the way. His code of quality even exceeded ours! We are so grateful to have had him work with us. Mark Besnos  (owner of Horizon Construction) checked in frequently to make sure the work being done met his high standards as well. Mark’s wife Enna and the office staff (Anna and Carolyn) kept us informed as to the work schedule and who to expect on the job site. They were easy to communicate with and always available to address our questions and concerns.
Bottom line, we love our remodeled home and would recommend Horizon Remodeling and Construction…yes, even to our family members."
5,"Recently, we were looking to completely remodel our 1968 master bathroom and create a comfortable, beautiful and functional retreat.  After reading many reviews and viewing several sites, we contacted Horizon Construction and Remodeling to take on the project.  From the first meeting until the final sign off, we found the team to be completely professional, knowledgeable and trustworthy.  During our initial consultation, Mark took our vision and made a beautiful and workable plan that incorporated the custom cabinets and high-end finishes which were consistent with our preferences.  Those plans were transformed into a stunning and comfortable oasis which we enjoy on a daily basis.  When we had questions, changes, or concerns, they were addressed immediately and always to our satisfaction.  During several inspections, our city inspector commented on the outstanding job the team was doing and the rapid pace at which they were completing projects.  The office would keep us informed regarding the daily schedule and as to which teams would be here.  The workman are all skilled craftsmen which shows in their work.  They were respectful, courteous, and meticulous.  Everyday the workspace and surrounding areas were cleaned methodically, taking great care to protect our hardwood floors. This process was first rate from beginning to end, so much so we will be using them in the future to remodel our kitchen.  Quality work, craftsmanship at the highest level, and a professional team, Horizon Construction and Remodeling are top notch and I would recommend them to everyone whether your project is small or large.  Horizon can do it all.  Thank you Horizon for a job well done!"
1,"I called for appointment after reading reviews:
Met with Horizon on January 12, 2016, at least an hour, will be giving me an estimate
Jan. 23, I called office Mgr. Anna to ask why I had not heard back from them, told he was working on other projects to and she would check with him, ask to be called for update. 
Feb. 20, 2016 I went back into my email and found an email from Michael dated Jan. 25, saying Anna said I had called, it takes long due to my circumstance but said he would have it by Wed. with would be (1-27-16). Today is February 20, 2016 and I have not heard from or received any word from Horizon."
5,"We came to Horizon with a home that was in poor shape and needed not only remodeling, but also major infrastructure repair and updates, such as piping, wiring, A/C and heating, etc.  Horizon was proactive in advising us on design, selection and quality of materials, forthcoming with responses to our questions and concerns.  I am not what you'd call an ""easy"" customer, but Horizon was very responsive in resolving the issues that inevitably come up with any project of this scope.  They have also shown that they are willing to follow up on post-project touch-ups, etc; they are determined that we be fully satisfied with the project. 

We are extremely happy in our ""new"" home (it IS like new to us,) and gladly recommend them.  The project was very expensive, due to the damage and poor maintenance accruing over many years, and Horizon was also helpful in assisting us to find financing when our other sources were VERY slow and unhelpful in responding."
4,"Our kitchen was gross. A DIY job by the previous owner on the cheap. Nasty drawers and cabinets that would shed wood particles all over our plates. A poorly placed dishwasher that couldn't open all the way made it completely useless. It needed to go. 

We researched contractors for over 6 months. Interviewed and got bids from 4. Horizon was the most expensive, which was a concern for us - but their strong reviews, experience and overall professionalism gave us peace of mind that was worth the additional cost. 

They worked with our budget to put together a plan that met our needs. After signing with them there were some unexpected things that came up. A few change orders, and our project manager left the company just as we started demo... But throughout, Mark and Enna were helpful and responsive.  

The foreman Effy and his whole crew were great to work with and they made a point to leave the job site neat and tidy at the end of the day.

This was our first major remodel and we're not the most laid back folks... So it was stressful. Despite all of our little worries along the way, Horizon ultimately came through and gave us the beautiful kitchen that we had been dreaming of."
4,"My kitchen project involved completely demolishing my old kitchen and making a brand new one. This also involved removing a load-bearing post and widening the opening to my living room. When I first spoke with Horizon, I had no idea what I wanted to do with the space, other than removing the load-bearing post and opening the doorway. The first time I met with the Project Manager, he showed me pictures of other kitchens, measured my existing kitchen, and sketched out some ideas of how the space could be redone. I appreciated the time he took to help develop how the new space would look. As with any construction project, there were a couple minor delays, and that’s to be expected. As a result, the project took a bit longer to complete than anticipated. What resulted was a beautiful, functional, new kitchen and I am so happy with the outcome. While the Project Manager that I had initially worked with left the company mid-project, the work continued to be carried out as planned. I only met Mark one time toward the latter part of the project, but was told that he had been at my home regularly throughout the project. Enna was my e-mail angel; always replying in a timely manner to my questions and concerns. The foreman that worked at my house was very helpful and kept in communication with me. I love my new kitchen and look forward to many years of enjoyment with family and friends. I would use Horizon again for future home improvement projects."
5,"Hi Enna!Mark was here this morning to check out our Bathroom and we are sad we missed him!  We wanted to give him a great big thank you and a hug!  Please tell him thanks from us!  Thanks to you too Enna, Caroline, Anna, Sam and your whole crew!  You all have made this experience very pleasant!  All of you have been kind, considerate and made us feel like we mattered!  We appreciate you!We absolutely love our bathroom!  It's beautiful and works so much better for us!  I have been posting pictures and telling friends and family about the whole experience!  I have one lady who may redo her bathrooms and another today that asked for your name to give to her daughter!  We will continue to brag about you and our bathroom!Thank you again!Marlene and Dennis Baker"
5,"This was the fourth project that Horizon Construction has done for us. They did a complete remodel of our kitchen, both bathrooms, and removed popcorn ceilings and repainted two family rooms. This project involved removing a chimney that sat perpendicular from the wall in the middle of our family room. They did the complete demo in one day, sealing off the room with plastic to cut down on dust as much as they could. Very impressed! They had to patch the roof, patch the ceiling, and the wall. The very creative part was what to do with the floor area where the chimney base had been. The tile on the floor surrounding the area was discontinued so we were able to find a similar tile that their amazing tile guy laid at a diagonal and it looks fantastic!!! As I have always stated before, Horizon is not perfect (let me know if you do find a contractor who does perfect work the very first time!!). But they will always make sure you are completely satisfied with the work before leaving, no matter what. I respect that and that is why they have come back to do work at our house four times!!!"
5,"Master Bath Remodel.  This is the third time we hired Horizon.  We were very happy with their previous work (a kitchen remodel and replacing all the crown molding and baseboards throughout the house) so we had no hesitation in hiring them again.   Mark came over and we talked through our wish list for the bathroom remodel.  He offered useful suggestions and came back to us quickly with a detail plan and a price.  Mark met with us twice at the tile store to help us make our selections.  The whole project then proceeded very smoothly.  Enna was quite helpful along the way in keeping us up to date and on top of all the decisions that had to be made.  Workers were there every day and they were all well-skilled, polite and neat.  There were a few issues that came up, but Mark and Enna and the workers always heard our concerns and made sure that everything was always completed to our complete satisfaction.   The bathroom turned out beautifully with clean lines and gorgeous materials, just like we dreamed of."
5,"Description Of Work: 

Initially called them for some upstairs floor repair, tile and carpet replacement throughout house, including replacement of baseboards. Upon removal of carpet, found some cracks indicative of foundation damage.  City engineer required geologic report which contractor arranged for, and contractor worked with city to settle on required remediation, (significant concrete footing additions and drainage) which was responsible for 2/3 of total cost. Contractor also replaced stair banister and rail and installed new front door.


Member Comments: 


The project timeline was extended significantly by the discovery of the need for foundation work and the involvement of the City in that process.  Otherwise, all the work of the contractor was excellent, timely and efficient.  Every day the worksite was left clean and the house was livable through entire process.  Workers were very skilled and eager to please and did excellent work. We had purchased new lighting for the house and they arranged for an electrician to do the installation for us.

Omri, the project manager, was excellent at keeping us apprised of scheduled work times and visits, and with suggestions or variations of our ideas to enhance the house further. The business owner, Mark, was on site from time to time, including at the foundation specialist's initial visit. Occasionally additional work was recommended, generally for completion of the remodeling, or as recommended for long term benefit.

Horizon's quality of work is excellent, they are honest, and the price of the work is fair. I can not overstate my satisfaction with my relationship with them."
5,"My husband and I started our remodeling journey in February 2015. At first we wanted to just update our kitchen. But after a while we decided to expand the project and remove the walls between the kitchen, dining room and family room and create one big open space. We worked with a construction company for more than 3 months. We met with them many times and finally we decided they were not up to the task. 
My husband found Horizon from the Angie’s list and he setup an appointment.  When Mark came to our house he explained the process to us. They would do the the plans, get them approved  by the city and then we could use him for construction or go with another companies. He gave us a reasonable price for the drawings. He also showed us many pictures from different projects he had worked on. Projects in which he had moved or removed walls. That was important to me. Horizon move very quickly and we had  approved plans in less than 3 weeks. Our project was not just upgrading rooms. There was serious structural change we needed to do. Removing all 3 load bearing walls and adding 2 huge beams across the house. It still scares me when I think about it. 
The construction project was supposed to take 3 months. The crews were in our house almost every day. And they worked really hard. The job site was kept clean and organized. We had a payment chart so we paid each piece after it was done. Demolition, material, footers, etc. I never forget the day we came home after a 3 day trip and saw the walls completely gone, beams up there and for the first time we could see our new space. It was very exciting. There were no big surprises but a few issues did come up but Mark and his team explained them and we work through them easily. Mark responded to all of our concerns and questions and was  always available.
The project finished just under 3 months and we are extremely happy with the result and experience. Mark and his team are true professionals. I also want to add that Enna was very helpful in the entire process keeping us up-to-date. Horizon made this project look easy. But I know it was not. They basically took our 1970 old, outdated and dark house and brought it to year 2015 making it look bright and open. Thank you Horizon Construction"
5,"We chose Horizon Construction for  a master bathroom remodel. The company was very professional, the project manager was extremely organized. Workers showed up each day when scheduled and left everything clean at the end of the day. The owner always did a final inspection. The final product was beautiful! We will definitely use them again for the next remodel."
5,"The project went smoothly from beginning to end.  Omri, the project manager, was very helpful and patient in helping choose the tile and fixtures for the bathroom.  Tal and his crew were very good at their jobs, whether it be the demo or the plumbing or tiling. Enna in the office kept us informed of the schedule which was very helpful.  The end result is a beautiful bathroom that we love!  Thank you Horizon!"
5,"Not many people would describe a kitchen renovation as a pleasant experience, but my husband and I would. 

Ours is a 50s tract home, and we wanted to update the small kitchen without it looking out of synch with the rest of the house, what we like to call ""mid century modest,"" AND we wanted to incorporate our vintage white Wedgewood range. We're a bit eclectic in our taste and were looking for someone who ""got"" our vision...kind of mid century without the kitsch or the ultra moderne style, with maybe a little Craftsman thrown in for good measure. It was a challenge to find that someone in our area.

We initially got quotes from two other contractors who were willing to do what we thought we wanted. When we met with our third candidate, Mark Besnos of Horizon Construction & Remodeling, and described our desire to, for instance, relocate the sink, Mark said ""You don't want to do that."" At first we were taken aback, then saw the wisdom when he explained why moving the sink would be a big mistake. He was absolutely right, and we hired him on the spot.

From Day 1 we were impressed by the steady communication with the office (run by his lovely wife, Enna) letting us know what to expect from day to day and addressing any questions or concerns we might have. We were equally impressed by the attention to detail and overall craftsmanship performed by each member of Mark's crew: every single detail was honed to perfection...cabinetry, floor tile, backsplash, paint, installations, even cleanup. A few changes were accommodated without undue stress or expense. 

We did have one unfortunate surprise when the load-bearing wall with the pass-through between the dining area and kitchen turned out to need reinforcement due to the work of the ""handyman"" who had owned the house before us. He had actually cut the support beams to create the pass-through, left them dangling, and then just closed up the wall. It's a miracle the house didn't fall down during an earthquake! So even though the fix meant a little more money than we anticipated, it was absolutely necessary and we now have a safer, more stable home. And the pass-through looks stunning! 

I did want to mention that the Caesarstone ""Concrete"" countertop is NOT suitable for a family with kids as it shows every handprint and drip. I failed to read the caveat on the Caesarstone Care & Maintenance page that clearly states: ""Please understand that Honed, Concrete and Motivo™ finishes will require more daily maintenance than our polished finishes. Since there is more exposed surface area with these finishes, metal marks, fingerprints and other signs of daily living will show on these materials."" Bottom line: I've become a bit obsessive with a micro fiber towel always at hand.

Horizon is a small, family-owned business run by and staffed by kind, caring, and competent professionals each of whom goes the extra mile to provide complete customer satisfaction. Even though Mark had to leave the country unexpectedly, the job stayed on track during his absence and was finished within the expected timeframe. 

It's no wonder Horizon has so many positive reviews, and we will definitely be using them again when we're ready to tackle our outdated bathrooms."
5,"We had no intention of redoing our 58-year-old kitchen (we had put up with it for so long) until Anna from Horizon called one day.  I never appreciate sales calls, but Anna was so pleasant that I scheduled a consultation with Mark.  He was very thorough and helpful.  Before we knew it, our kitchen was being completely renovated.  Everyone at Horizon was very patient with us as we chose materials and I invariably worried about everything!  Mark and Enna kept reassuring me that it would all be fine, and they would take care of everything.  And they did!  They redid our kitchen and pantry from top to bottom.  They also replaced the floor in the entry and guest bathroom, and replaced all the door and floor moldings.  Their workers were skilled, very polite and respectful, and cleaned up after themselves every afternoon before they left.  The finished kitchen is gorgeous!  Exactly what I wanted.....simple, clean, and warm!  It is a perfect kitchen for this house.  Any issues, large or small, that arose were taken care of to our satisfaction. Mark, Enna and the rest of their office and construction crew were wonderful.  I'm actually going to miss them!  I would not hesitate to recommend them, and I will not hesitate to call them for future projects."
5,"We are very pleased with our new master bathroom! It is gorgeous! The bathroom was gutted and Horizon replaced the tiled walk-in shower and bathroom floor, installed a custom vanity and two huge framed mirrors, and all new plumbing and electrical fixtures. They also scraped, textured and painted our master bedroom ceiling. Mark was creative in helping us with design ideas and made sure all the details that we envisioned were taken care of to our satisfaction. Enna was in the office and guided us through the process, answering any questions or concerns we had along the way. She was knowledgeable herself, or she referred our questions to Mark or Tal, our foreman. Communication was quick and constant...either by email or phone. All the people who worked on our project were courteous, competent, and kept our home as clean as possible, tidying up each day before leaving. Our project started on time and finished on time, with people working every day. We always felt we were in very good hands. With anyone else we might have had a nice bathroom, but with Horizon we have a BEAUTIFUL bathroom!"
5,"Services provided: Bathroom remodels, bathroom addition, tongue-in-groove ceiling, built-in cabinetry  around fireplace, pergola, fencing. 
My husband and I are extremely happy with the work performed by Horizon Construction. All the built-ins and cabinetry work are beautiful. The bathrooms are the envy of our friends and neighbors. Every team of construction specialists that came into our house took great pride in their work. And outside, the pergola and new fencing are beautiful as well. Indeed, our house could be featured as a 'before and after' transformation in a designer magazine. With a project of this magnitude, there are bound to be surprises behind the walls. What was so great about Horizon was that they stepped up to the plate and went above and beyond to resolve every issue. Customer service is not just lip service with them, they take it to heart. Their reputation as a premier remodeler is very important to them. Our project manager, Omri Nave, was professional and extremely responsive, as was Enna Eskin in the office. 
As a side note I should add that we were originally going with another contractor recommended by friends, but after many weeks and still no firm bid from that contractor, I searched for a contractor on Angie's List.  Omri from Horizon came out immediately and met with my husband at the house we had just purchased (I was in Arizona at the time). Omri worked until very late that night to prepare the detailed bid, and my husband signed on the dotted line without hesitation.
It is never easy to go through a remodel project of this size, especially while you are living in the house. But we are so grateful to the Horizon team for their professionalism and dedication to customer satisfaction. What few issues came up were resolved quickly and without hassle. We would recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling without reservation."
5,"I have never written a review about any company before mainly because I have never worked with a company that delivered what it promised.  That ended when we contracted Horizon Construction and Remodeling. Not only was the work done beautifully but was finished within the timeline we set, and they delivered as promised.
I can't say enough about this company.  Mark Besnos and his crew are without a doubt the best contractor and professionals we have ever worked with.  When we first met with Mark we knew he was the right guy.  He works within your budget and has so many great ideas that help with your design decision making.   Also, behind every successful company there is a very professional office staff.  Enna Eskin makes sure that all the paper work is done and expedited on time.  She's great to work with and is there to answer any questions you might have.  You feel like family with this company because they take such good care of you.  
Mark oversees every aspect of the project himself. He arrived everyday before and after his workers finished their work and walked through the project and inspected it.  If something didn't meet his approval he would tag it and have them redo it.  He is a perfectionist and it shows when the project is done.  His crew cleaned up every night after they finished their work and left us with a clean house to live in and that was not an easy task to do.  We remodeled out Master Bath, put new granite and a backsplash in the kitchen, installed wood floors throughout the house, and a beautiful new staircase.
If you are looking for the Rolls Royce of Contractors, don't look any further.  Horizon Construction and Remodeling is the company for you want.  You won't be disappointed."
4,"When we bought our home, we knew we wanted to take on a massive remodel/upgrade. We interviewed and gathered estimates from four Southern California general contractors, all of them coming in with high ratings and reviews from Houzz, Yelp, Angie’s List and BBB. Horizon did not come in the lowest bidder, however, their professionalism, conduct of business, their interaction with their clients and attention to detail was what made them stand out from the others. 

Undergoing a project as big as ours (a complete remodel of master bath, all new windows and doors, new flooring throughout the house, a complete new stair case, opening up a room, blowing out wall, painting the whole interior, changing out hardware, adding a pergola and incorporating a 15' bi-fold door) there are going to be bumps and unforeseen turns in the road. 

From relocating an outlet for daily convenience to installing a new header beam to comply with city permitting, no task was too small for Horizon the scope of our remodeling project. Their team of designers and contractors walked us through picking out our materials, gave us experienced advice and listened to our dream home vision. What we originally though we wanted or thought about forgoing, Horizon helped us plan and design around our budget and keep the big picture in perspective. At the end of the six-month project we were very impressed with how Horizon handed all the different types of issues and challenges that arouse. 

This house is our ""20 year home"" where will be raising our children, having family gatherings and hosting countless friends. We have now lived the home for three months (construction free) and we are very happy with the quality of service and out come of our remodel done by the team at Horizon Construction and Remodel."
5,"I hired Horizon for an excavation and construction project for a second living unit on my property. They made the whole process so smooth. Omer, the project manager and designer, was extremely helpful. I felt like I was his only priority. He made the hardest stage of my project so easy. I have actually gained a friend from the process that we went through and him making it so enjoyable. There was not a single struggle even in the inevitable unforeseen obstacles. He made them dissolve. In a way, I want to have another project just so I can work with them all over again."
5,"Working with Mark and Enna from Horizon Construction and Remodeling was a great experience.  They were professional, punctual, precise, and communicative.  Each day work was performed, their workers made sure to leave as little impact or disturbance in the area.  The work done is of high quality - they were able to transform our bathroom out of the 1960s into something modern, clean, and functional.  We were in constant communication via text/phone/email.  They were very patient when we were picking out our cabinet colors - leaving us samples to ensure that we got the exact color and style we wanted.  And of the three contractors we bid the job out to, there price was very reasonable.  I appreciated the personal touch they add to their service - always making sure that we were satisfied with each step of the process.  We will definitely be calling Mark and Enna again when it comes time to get our kitchen out of the 60s."
5,"The project included ceiling repair and remodeling in entry hall, dining room and living room.  The process was easy, efficient, and included myself throughout the steps.  Pricing was fair, timing was accommodating, and I am most pleased with the results.  Omer Barel was terrific and made me feel that I was in most capable, confident hands.  Overall, a good experience, and I would recommend them to anyone."
5,"This is the kitchen my wife has been waiting for since we bought our house 16 years ago.  She loves the final product!  To be honest, we were not planning on spending this much on our kitchen remodel; however, we chose Horizon based on over 100 reviews and our experiences with other contractors in the past.  So, based on the reviews, we knew we were going to spend more money than the average kitchen remodel.  Having dealt with several projects over the years, I also was aware we were going to go over budget along with having some challenges along the way.  We did have a couple of issues that looked like they were going to go sideways, but Horizon listened to and took care of those issues to the best of their ability each time--and, to good effect.  I spent the most time communicating with Enna--almost always over the phone or by E-mail--and found her easy to work with.  I had read reviews that said some things about Enna being difficult to get along with, but I did not find that to be the case.  Keep in mind, all of the reviews that had those comments in them did not actually have work done by Horizon.  Enna was there to help solve a couple of problems by making certain one of her crew got to our house, by coming to our house herself, or by, for example, crediting us $741 for the ceiling drywall replacement [because I thought we did not need to replace it].  There were several Horizon employees that helped the remodeling experience [often stressful] more tolerable.  Horizon arranged to have a Porta-Potty outside our house so the workers would not have to use our bathrooms.  They also arranged the appointments with the city for the permit inspections.  There were some communication problems at times; however, I soon learned that going straight to Enna was the best way to solve any problems that cropped up.  If anyone wonders why I rated Horizon a ""B"" for price I have a simple answer:  their are not the low-end bid--they are likely closer to the higher-end bid.  But, you get what you pay for.  So, the ""B"" is to give prospective customers a heads-up that you ought to plan accordingly.  That said, we chose an expensive (beautiful) piece of granite, had special space-saving aspects added to our cabinets, glass-tile backsplash, under-counter lighting, travertine tile floor, and more.  There were no significant surprises except . . . WE REALLY LOVE OUR NEW KITCHEN!  However, I would say that was more of an expectation than a surprise."
5,"Due to a water leak issue, I had to remodel my kitchen and part of the family room.  After many interviews and careful consideration I selected Horizon Construction and Remodeling who, in addition, was highly rated by customers on Angie’s list.  It proved to be a very good decision!  Mr. Ormi Nave was my Project Manager whose expertise guided me through design, style and material selections.  The cabinet maker, electrician, plumber, painter/drywall, tile installer were all excellent at their craft!  Upper management also reviewed on-site work excellence and progression.  The Horizon team maintained a high level of professionalism and integrity throughout the entire project.   I highly recommend Horizon for your next project!"
5,"Our project consisted of a complete kitchen remodel (including soffit removal and fireplace facelift) along with new flooring and cabinets in the bathroom and laundry room.  We also replaced the flooring in the entry way as well as the coat closet and linen cabinet.    Horizon Construction was not the least or most expensive quote we gathered.  One deciding factor for us was that Mark offered ideas and suggestions during the quoting process.  We had a general concept that we were shooting for but this was our first kitchen remodel so we were also looking for expert advice on layout, materials and design.  Response time to questions and change orders was quick.  As with any work in an older home, surprises occurred and adjustments were made throughout the project which affected the timeline and cost.  Mark walked us through these obstacles as he knew we were detail oriented.  We did experience some discrepancies in what was agreed upon with Mark and what was executed by the crew.  These mistakes were all quickly fixed at no additional cost to us (other than time lost).  We had an assigned foreman for some of the trades but ultimately Mark acted as our main point of contact for everything.  The crew was professional, hard-working and respectful.  We were not pleased with the semi-custom cabinet installers.  Horizon’s custom cabinet maker who worked on some of our other pieces was much better with a higher quality product.   Final cabinet details were fixed and completed in a timely manner by him.  Overall, we were very pleased with the final results!"
5,"Kitchen Remodel.
Horizon just completed a gut rehab remodel of our kitchen (which included removing a wall) and we were very pleased with the whole process. This was our first remodeling project and we didn't quite know what to expect going into it. We worked primarily with Omri who did an absolutely wonderful job keeping everything on track and helping us each step of the way. He truly went above and beyond to ensure that our needs were met and that we were happy with the end result. The remodel was completed in a timely manner and each of the work crews that came in were courteous, professional and cleaned everything up at the end of each day. Another plus for us was that Horizon was all inclusive. We didn't have to choose a separate place to buy/install the cabinets from and another for the counters, etc. They handle everything which makes it so much easier!"
5,"Horizon Construction did an incredible job on our kitchen from day one!  Omri and Mark have been there each step of the way with great ideas and suggestions and then they bring fantastic workers in to make them a reality.  From countertops to cabinets to floors and plumbing they have the best of the best working for them.  We had a kitchen wall that needed to be removed and needless to say my wife and I were worried about tearing our house apart!  Horizon managed the process with precision and now the house looks like it was originally built without that wall. I can't say enough good things about this team - they are professional, diligent, responsible, fairly priced and they always do what they say they are going to do.  We have had a couple of issues along the way but Horizon demonstrated their commitment to customer service each time something came up.  They take responsibility and fix issues as they arise without any questions.  I would highly recommend Horizon to friends and family and encourage anyone considering a remodel to use them."
5,"Removed bathtub in master suite and constructed a walk-in shower, added a second water line to accommodate the shower heads, constructed a pocket door to separate the bedroom from the dressing room.  Electrical included led lights in my home office and other electrical work,  installed new faucets in the kitchen and 3 bathrooms and painted...

I chose Horizon Construction and Remodeling (HCR) because of their excellent presentation and fabulous reputation on Angie’s List. This was a wise decision because HCR proved to be an ethical, caring and efficient company. My original remodeling job was to remove the bathtub in the master suite and install a walk-in shower. During the remodeling, I added additional electrical, plumbing changes and repairs to my home. The HCR crew held my hands throughout the whole process. The office staff called me frequently to check how I was doing and to make sure everything was going okay.  The workers, in my home, were hardworking, fast and clean. There were a couple of hiccups with the job but I was very impressed with the prompt, same day, actions taken to correct any problems. In addition, all inspections were passed on first try. The price was reasonable for all of the work done and some things were not even charged. I whole heartedly recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling and I will call them again for my next remodeling project. 
Ella C."
5,"Our contractor was Mark Besnos.  Mark is definitely who you want doing your remodeling.  Mark is fastidious.  His attention to detail was unbelievable.  As picky as he is, I wouldn't want to be his wife.  As with any job, there were things that needed tweaking.  Mark made sure everything was absolutely perfect.  We had an issue with the stainless steel tiles for the backsplash.  After installing it was obvious that some of the tiles had a different finish (brushed finish instead of shiny finish).  Mark had the tile company come to the house.  He made sure the issue was fixed.  His office staff, Enna, and Anna, were terrific.  There was never a time when I called that I didn't get a hold of Mark, Enna, or Anna.  The best part, everyone who has come to see the kitchen, even all the subcontractors, complimented us on the kitchen.  It should be on the cover of Better Homes & Gardens.  Sherry."
5,"There are already the well-acknowledged passages associated with life; birth, marriage, divorce, graduation, the new job. I’d like to add one more—remodeling.

The decision to embark upon the renovation path, in most cases, involves entering into a relationship with a contractor. Selecting one, in many respects, is only slightly less important than say choosing a spouse or deciding to have children. Remodeling your home can be a journey filled with uncertainty, havoc and frustration as you work toward the beautiful surroundings you envisioned those many months earlier. As the old knight who guarded the room of chalices in a scene from the movie, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, mused, “Choose wisely.” 

Fortunately, we did when we contracted with Mark of Horizon Construction. You want your contractor to be competent, trustworthy, and reliable. Mark was all of these and more. 

Mark takes a personal interest in his work. He is on the site much of the time ensuring that his workers are doing their best. When things go wrong, he makes sure they get fixed. Like any relationship, there will be disagreements or misunderstandings, but Mark handled them in a professional and sincere manner. The bottom line here is that Mark wants his customers to be happy.

I could relate several episodes of Mark’s commitment to customer satisfaction, but the one that meant the most to us was when we had a sewer line back up into the house (no fault of Mark’s). Out of panic, I called Mark and he came out immediately and with his foreman worked on clearing the line. He didn’t have to do that. He could have told us to call a plumber and gone back to what he was doing.

I highly recommend Horizon Construction and Mark as your choice for your remodel project. You will have chosen wisely."
4,"My initial experience with Enna when I first called to set up an appointment was very professional and pleasant. We set up an appointment to meet with Mark, the GC, within 2 weeks of the call. Mark was professional, listened well to what we had in mind, augmented these visions with his own excellent design ideas, and made us feel very confident at the first meeting that Horizon was likely the best choice for us. After meeting with several other GCs over the next few weeks, Horizon was in our top 3 finalists, and we made the choice to move forward with them based on our feelings of confidence that they really understood what we wanted to do. Horizon was not the lowest bidder, nor were they the highest.
 After confirming with Mark our choice to move forward with Horizon, we met with him again to go over in more detail the project scope and timeline and to sign paperwork for the plan development. The initial project timeline was identified as 10-12 weeks. Soon after this meeting, he swiftly had plans drawn up for the architectural changes to our kitchen and living room and submitted them for approval. Expecting approval to take several weeks, Mark suggested we start working on the master bathroom remodel so as not to lose momentum. During Master Bath demolition, Mark identified some unanticipated framing work after the walls were stripped. Although I was not expecting this, we compromised on the cost of addressing this work, which set the tone for addressing unexpected work going forward. Work on the Master Bath went longer than expected based on some changes to scope as well as some permit hang-ups, but the finished product was exactly what we wanted.
 Approval of the Kitchen\Living Room plans came back quicker than expected (in a few days as opposed to weeks), and work on the kitchen and living room commenced and ran concurrent with the work on the master bathroom. This work involved removing walls between the galley kitchen, the den/4th bedroom, the living room and the dining area with the ultimate design goal being a great room spanning all of these areas. Due to removing load-bearing walls, support beams had to be installed in the attic and 6 foot deep underpinnings had to be dug and placed in a several areas. Although the inside of our house was unrecognizable, the work proceeded on schedule for the most part. During the project, we did make some adjustments to overall scope (not changing planned work, just adding new work to overall scope, e.g., originally we had no intention of touching the fireplace, or any of the bedrooms; we made some decisions midstream to have Horizon redo the fireplace
 and floor and paint all of the bedrooms based upon design ideas from Mark). Change management on these items (and other items) was handled well by Enna. After the Master Bathroom completed, Horizon started on the guest bathroom remodel, which involved the following:

 > Removal of HVAC unit from closet adjacent to the bathroom.
 > Demolition of walls between HVAC closet, bathroom, and adjacent coat closet.
 > Installation of new HVAC unit in the attic.

 Utilizing the square footage from the HVAC closet and the coat closet effectively doubled the square footage of the guest bathroom allowing us to convert it into a full bath with double vanity (from a ¾ bath). This was the last aspect of the project to complete.Considering that we lived in the house through the project (with the exception of 3 non-continuous weeks for vacation), we were eager to see the project complete, and we are extremely happy with the results. Horizon saw the vision we had for transforming the interior of our 55 year old ranch style house into something more modern and beautiful, and they executed on it.
 The only negative thing I feel compelled to note is that the crew was not considerate about keeping the work site clean: Paint brushes were rinsed out in the plants in the front yard; razors, cuttings from wood, discarded pieces of wire, food wrappings, etc continually littered my front yard and driveway. I asked Mark and Enna to address with their crew at least two times, however it didn't fix the situation and I ultimately ended up cleaning up after the crew. This may seem petty or perhaps I am naïve about a project of this magnitude, but it made me feel disrespected as a customer for my concerns about this to go effectively ignored.
 Lastly I have to say that, Horizon Construction (Mark, Enna and their whole crew) we're extremely friendly and nice throughout the entirety of the project. Never once did I second guess my choice. By the end of the project, I still felt comfortable that we had made the best choice. Since the completion of the project, Horizon has cheerfully addressed any issues that have come up."
5,"We hired Mark and his team to come and install Marble flooring in our formal dining/living room. They were quick, efficient and very clean. He was very thorough about what the layout was going to look like, making sure to ask if I had any changes to the design. It came out looking gorgeous. Enna was also very personable and thorough. Confirmations for everything was emailed and discussed so there were no ""surprises"" or hiccups and misunderstandings. Overall they did a great job."
5,"We have been working with Horizon Construction for many years now. Their projects are beautiful and we are proud to be a part of it. They are detail oriented and give close attention to every aspect of their work. Enna & Mark have been a pleasure to work with, easy going and pleasant .

5,"When we first met Mark Besnos (owner) at our house, he asked a lot of questions, offered suggestions, and was not at all afraid to offer his opinion when he thought we were wrong (this can be off-putting I suppose, except after you work with Mark for a while you will come to appreciate that he really knows what he is doing and you should listen to him!).  Of the five bids we received for this work, Mark's was by far the most detailed and the only one that covered all of the details we discussed.  Not the cheapest bid by far, but when I went back and looked at the holes in the other bids I had no doubt they would have change ordered us to death and I would have ended up spending the same or more likely more.

The work started promptly and once started stayed pretty much on schedule throughout.  Enna always kept us informed when things were going to be done, so there were never any major surprises.  There were problems along the way as there always are in remodeling, and this is where Horizon really shines in my opinion - Mark always said ""Don't worry, we will take care of it"", and they always did.  Every time.  If you have had remodel work done before you know how rare this is.  It's the way a business should be run, unfortunately many contractors don't seem to get it.

We are extremely pleased with the work they did.  In particular, our master bath which has all new cabinetry, onyx counter, travertine floors and shower walls, frameless glass shower and rainfall shower are spectacular.  I remark to my wife when I get out of the shower in the morning that I feel like I'm staying at the Ritz Carlton! 

Thanks Mark and Enna.  You guys are great!"
5,"We have working with Horizon for many years, they give every customer personalized attention and they have an eye for detail work. They are experts in the area of remodeling with an eye for fresh ideas in the design field. Trusted reliable service, It doesn't get any better in customer service!"
5,"The remodeling included the demolition and reconstruction of 2 bathrooms. It included converting the guest bath to a walk-in shower with tile and a frameless glass enclosure. The job included replacing the vanities, countertops, installing porcelain tile throughout, new bathtub installed in the master bath, changes to the plumbing and all new fixtures including sinks, exhaust fans, and lighting. 
We selected Horizon Construction & Remodeling because of the good ratings they received from customers who had work done by them. The cost was higher than some other quotes I received but I was concerned about the quality of the workmanship and considered the customer satisfaction ratings Horizon received from their customers. As it turned out, the work was completed on time, within budget and the quality of the work was excellent. We are very satisfied with how everything turned out. As in any project, issues arise but they were quickly resolved with no excuses. Mark inspected the work as it progressed and Enna communicated with us every step of the way so there were no surprises. They got a building permit from the City of Huntington Beach for the remodeling as we requested and we had no problems passing any phase of the inspection process. We would recommend them to our friends."
5,"Added 215 sq.ft. to Master Bedroom including enlarged and remodeled Master Bathroom, siting area, and walk-in closet.
Member Comments: 
This was the second project we've contracted with Horizon (first was a kitchen remodel in 2009). Work was completed on schedule, within budget, and met all our expectations. Horizon kept us apprised of the progress by email (e.g. ""Tomorrow they will install the counter top""). They stayed on the job until every item on our ""Punch List"" had been addressed to our satisfaction. Mark and Enna are a very nice couple and are a joy to work with. When unforeseen problems arise (and they always do), Enna's voice over the phone is very calming and reassuring and indeed all problems were resolved. Mark walks through the project frequently and will spot items that don't meet his expectations and see that they are corrected without us having to say a word.
We will definitely use them again for our next project."
5,"Horizon had to take down two walls and put In a beam to create our open layout kitchen. It was a huge job and we took three bids. But the other two bids wouldn't take out the walls, and we didn't want to settle. Mark said yes right away and brought an engineer who gave the okay. Every change easy passed by us for approval and the work was done very well. Issues we had after the remodel were handled. Someone visiting said it looked like it was always there, but my husband and I know what a huge transformation this kitchen was to our house and our lives. Enna was a great lifeline through the whole project which was completed before the estimated time."
5,"Complete remodel of kitchen, demo of old exterior concrete stone and fireplace. Replaced with stack stone. Installation of wood flooring. 


We went through several contractors (6 to be exact) before we found the right one. From the moment we called Horizon Construction, Enna made use feel very comfortable. We explained to Enna what we wanted and what we were looking for. She stated that Mark Besnos would be out to see us and see what he can do. Mark who is the owner and designer gave us a very beautiful vision of what our kitchen would look like. We felt at ease with Mark and fell in love with his ideas. We have finally found our contractor. We only had signed a contract with Horizon to remodel our kitchen but asked mark what he could also do with the exterior of the house and gave us another beautiful vision. He recommended to remove the old concrete stone around the house and by the fireplace and replace it with stack stone. The final out come is amazing. We also wanted to remove the old carpet and install wood flooring and gave him the job as well and they did an excellent job of installing our wood flooring. Our overall experience with the Horizon Construction crew was very good. The crew was very polite, on time, and cleaned up after them selves at the end of the work day. Mark and his foreman Elly were there almost everyday to ensure that the projects were getting done as we have specified and would correct any issues we had with some of the installations. Given the amount of time we gave Horizon Construction they finished the job as specified and did a beautiful job. We have gotten many, many compliments on our house and can only thank Mark, Enna, Elly and the Horizon Construction crew for all there hard work and for making our experience and great one."
5,"Just want to say that we are extremely happy with the kitchen remodel that Horizon Construction completed for us. Our home was built in the late 1940s and was really showing its age. We wanted to have an open floor plan that incorporated the kitchen, dining room and living room. We had some ideas and a budget for what we were willing to spend. Mark took our ideas and make them come to life! He has an eye for design and style and a commitment to quality and detail. He and Enna are both committed to making sure their clients are satisfied and happy.
We took out a load bearing wall between the old kitchen and living room and now have a wonderful large room. This was the second kitchen remodel I have lived through and this one was definitely the best. Mark said he would be finished in 9 weeks and he was! Their crew worked Monday through Friday and showed up every day.  Enna called daily to keep us up to date, making sure we had appliances and spec sheets ready for the crew and making sure all our questions were answered. 
Mark was at the house every morning to direct the crew and attend to any details. He made sure that everything that we couldn’t see was done correctly as well as attending to details like overhead lamp and outlet placement and overall design functionality and appearance. Mark had the placement of the lamp over our dining table changed several times (without our knowing) until he was satisfied that it would be in the right place – and it was!
The crew was absolutely great. They arrived at about the same time every morning, went right to work but were always patient and answered any questions we may have had. The absolute best thing is that they cleaned up their work area every day without fail. They put up plastic so construction dust in the rest of the house was kept to a minimum which I really appreciated.
If you are wondering if Horizon is the company for you – our answer is YES! Do it, you will be very happy with the result. We sure are!"
5,"We chose Horizon Construction because of Mark's vision for our bathrooms in our initial consultation. Our bathrooms are rather small, and we had a few ideas of what we wanted before Mark came over, but he quickly suggested what would and wouldn't work based on his extensive experience and design knowledge. Mark is very good at being straightforward with you on what needs to be done for the space you have to renovate. Some might consider his straightforwardness slightly abrupt, but don't let that put you off - he's very good at what he does and has a passion for his work and the details, and he knows the work his crew does is a reflection of himself and his company (as he should).

We mainly interacted with Enna, Horizon's business manager and design consultant, from that point forward, though Mark did visit the project regularly. He also made himself available at any time should you want to go over any details with him. Enna's responsiveness and regular communication is a big reason we are as happy as we are with how the project turned out. Not many contracting companies have someone like Enna to be your customer service rep., design consultant, project coordinator, complaint department, etc. Enna is very responsive, competent, nice, and professional, and made the 2+ months of having workers in our home a tolerable (and almost pleasant :-) ) experience. 

Day one, Enna and Mark met us at the tile store to sign the contracts and help us pick out flooring, countertops, and glass borders, which was incredibly helpful. Work began quickly afterwards, and the crew was at our house just about every week day for around 2 months. Each crew member was very nice, respectful, hard working, and we trusted them implicitly to work and lock up after themselves while we were at work. Coming home from work each day was an exciting event; seeing progress was a treat and they always cleaned up after themselves each day. 

Mark visited the site regularly and corrected any issues and small details he found, and listened to any concerns we had. We never felt we were being given the runaround or that our ideas and concerns were insignificant. For example they installed a 4"" vanity backsplash which didn't connect well to a 6"" wood trim piece. We pointed it out and they tore out the marble backsplash and redid it to 6"". 

Now, I'm not saying there weren't frustrations. Some language barriers and miscommunication between ourselves, management, and the crew reared its head from time to time, but whenever issues arose they were always fixed to our satisfaction and never impacted the end product. I don't believe you can have a multi-month long project without these issues arising, and I chalk them up as normal, and don't mark them down for this. 

One miscommunication example was that we asked them to put insulation in the shower plumbing wall which bordered the bedroom for noise reduction. They forgot to do this during the rough plumbing and said if we still wanted it done, they would open up the drywall in the bedroom side, then patch and paint the bedroom wall, which they did end up doing. This was a minor issue, and we would have been fine if they didn't want to do the work, but they went out of their way to make us happy.

Other minor issues stemmed from the crew not looking at the fixtures we purchased before finishing the rough plumbing in the first bathroom. Their expectation was that we would point out anything other than standard fixtures (we had a bar with handheld shower head; they assumed fixed shower head). Our expectation was that they would check with us before commencing rough plumbing (or at least take a look at the fixtures). The result ended up not being a big issue - a slightly less than ideal placement for the water outlet valve. However, we learned a valuable lesson and made sure to go over rough plumbing for the master bath with them beforehand.

In the end, both baths turned out beautiful, more so than I imagined. Overall, we had a very positive experience and highly recommend Horizon. 

A few tips: 
Get your fixtures early; unless you're ordering from a big box store, some items take a few weeks to get in. 

Make sure your expectations and visions are communicated. Enna writes up a detailed scope of work, make sure this is correct, though some items are difficult to envision when you initially go over the contract. 

Make sure to meet with Mark and show him your fixtures and expected placements before the crew starts rough plumbing. It will be much more difficult to change things once this has started."
5,"We had recently purchased a home and wanted to do some extensive remodeling before we moved in. That job included:
- Installing a new loft in a room that had a vaulted ceiling, and tying that new 2nd floor room into the existing stairs and hallway. This included new recessed lighting for both the new loft, and the now-shorter bottom floor room.
- Remodel the kitchen, including removal of an old fireplace to open up the kitchen and living room, new tile floors, reface and refinish all cabinets, replace all appliances, new backsplash
- Create a new bedroom from an existing open space, and re-frame the closet walls in the new room and in the adjoining master closet
- New wood floors in the 1st floor of the house, and new carpeting in the 2nd floor
- New interior paint throughout
- Refinish the front door
- Miscellaneous (installing new lights/fans/etc)

This project required securing a few city permits, which Horizon did without problem.

All in, I think this was about a 3.5mo project. We did not move in until it was completed.

We now love Angie's List because that's how we found Horizon, Mark, Enna, and Eli !

We've had both good contractor experiences, and otherwise. We had never used Horizon prior to this job. Our experience with Horizon has gone very well over these months. We wished we had a bigger budget to have them do more work for us, because they do great work at good value, but eventually we simply had to stop so we could move in.

Horizon is geared for client satisfaction on reasonably sized general contractor jobs. Here's a few excerpts of our experience:
- As we were settling on early design decisions, Mark was really helpful. Mark has a unique set of skills in design, engineering, contracting, etc. He brought great ideas forward that were good value decisions. For example, we were creating a new bedroom for our son which was on the small side. He recognized that, and came up with the idea to reconfigure the closet and master bdrm closet that was reasonable, got us a bigger room for our son, and made use of wasted space so that the master closet is still the same size or slightly larger.
- We had many conversations, as normal for such a project, about materials, finishes, and etc. Mark was really helpful at guiding those discussions to make good value decisions, based on what he heard from us. We've had contractors in the past who really know only one style or price-point and try to push it constantly, but we felt that Mark did a great job of listening to what we wanted and coming up with good creative ideas and compromises based on our objectives.
- Mark, Enna, and Eli were all consistent and reliable. If they said they would meet us at the house at a certain time, they were there on time and ready. We'd be lying if we said they were perfect, but they really made every effort to do their best.
- Our area has a substantial list of HOA requirements. We never once had a single complaint from a neighbor or HOA the entire time, despite a lot of work being done. They hauled off their own trash so our little trash bin wasn't overwhelmed, and generally kept the place picked up. Thanks, Eli !
- Shortly after we started w/Horizon, my husband noticed that somebody had backed into the mailbox and asked Mark if he thought one of his guys had done it. Mark just looked at it, and said ""Don't worry, I'll fix it."" A couple days later, a new mailbox is there that matched the old one, all fixed up. No debates, just happened.
- Near the end of the project, my husband made a comment about how the drain plumbing was routed. A couple days later, it was fixed. Again, no big debate or issue, just happened.
- After our front door was refinished, the exterior had a green tint to it that we had not expected. It wasn't terrible, and perhaps we were the only ones who would notice. Mark asked how we liked it, and could tell from our first reaction we didn't really like how it looked. But, it was not a terrible issue and we formally told Mark and Enna, in writing, that we'd accept it as-is and not to worry resanding/finishing it only for a modest cosmetic issue. It looked fine, and quality was good, but we just had an expectation of a more brownish deep wood finish. A week or so later, they refinished the door anyway, and now looks perfect.

There are more little stories like that, but you get the point. We thought that Horizon was highly focused on Customer Satisfaction in the way they ran the project from beginning to end. They took care to do good quality work, sought client feedback in a constructive way, and addressed issues quickly and practically. They had to get some city permits in this project which they got without a big problem, and they passed all the city inspections without issue.

One of the things which makes Horizon unique from others we considered was that there was no middle-man handoff from the Sales rep to the person who actually manages the job. We worked with Mark, Enna, and later Eli throughout the entire project. We really enjoyed getting to know them, and we thought the continuity of the relationship definitely contributed to the efficient outcome.

In our experience with Horizon, we found them to be professional, ethical, skilled, and hard-working throughout the process. We would recommend Horizon to our own family members.

Thank You, Horizon. You are a great team !"
5,"Horizon Construction immediately responded to our request for a quote. Mark came out to the house, listened to our ideas, and helped us to plan a remodel that exactly fit what we wanted. He also helped with picking out materials that fit our budget.
Work started on time (once all permits were approved), and moved quickly, without any work breaks.
There were no issues in contacting Horizon, and any issues that came up during the project were quickly addressed. 
We would highly recommend the Horizon team (Mark, Enna, and Sam) to any of our friends.
Looking forward to doing business with them again."
5,"Rescued from a nightmare!!!

We had a horrific experience with another contractor which left us with a bathroom that we couldn't use. The contractor lost their license and we were left with realizing we were going to have to start all over again.

Horizon came in a rescued us from our misery and delivered a beautiful new master bathroom! We were able to even get our guest bathroom a partial facelift too and we paid about the same for all of it! The work was done on time and their experts workers were very courteous and always left our house in great shape after a hard day's work.

We will recommend Horizon to all of our friends and family.

5,"Complete remodel of all the entire downstairs and common area of upstairs of 3,100 square foot home. Work included 1) kitchen (design, demolition of old kitchen, new cabinets, granite countertops, plumbing, electrical, relocation of gas cook top and vents, stone flooring, baseboards, and painting 2) family room (design, removal of wet bar, new cabinets, granite countertops, new fireplace, wood flooring, baseboards, and painting), 3) living room (wood flooring, electrical, baseboards, and painting), 4) powder room (design, new cabinets, granite countertops, plumbing, electrical, baseboards, and stone flooring), 5) laundry room (stone flooring, baseboards, and painting), 6) refinishing of wood staircase and upstairs cabinets, and 7) carpet upstairs.

As you can see, this was a major remodel project. I wanted a contractor to oversee all aspects, work with me on the design, stay on top of the job, do professional grade work, and show up every day, all at a fair price. I got that with Horizon. You can go with a cheaper contractor but I doubt you will get all of these qualities. Mark spent a lot of time with my wife and I selecting cabinets, granite countertops, and flooring making design suggestions. He also made recommendations as the job progressed. Enna was in contact with me daily and was a pleasure to deal with. The job started the day they said it would and ended on time. I checked the work done daily. If there was every an issue or I was not happy for some reason it was corrected without discussion. Horizon even did some upgrades to improve the look of the job and did not charge for it. They did not charge any large up front fees instead I paid as each aspect of the job was started and completed. Mark did a final inspection at the end sending some workers back to do minor touch ups. I would highly recommend Horizon."
5,We recently had new wood floors installed in the entire downstairs of our house.  The job included demolition of existing tile and carpet.  They hauled away the old tile and carpet and did a wonderful job installing my new floors.  Horizon also converted my old patio into a new patio/sunroof.  They added walls around the existing patio and installed windows and a sliding  glass door and doggy door.  I had a wonderful experience working with Horizon Construction and Remodeling.  Mark Besnos and Enna Eskin were very pleasant to talk to and they responded to every call I made to them.  Mark was on the job frequently to be sure things were being done to my satisfaction.  His crew was very hard working and did an excellent job - they were on the job daily and always cleaned up prior to leaving.  I was amazed at the progress that was made each day.  The entire job took approximately 4 weeks and stayed within my budget.  I am very pleased with the final product.  My floors are beautiful and I love my new patio/sunroom.  I would very highly recommend them to anyone that had a  job to be done.  I definitely plan to use them again in the future.
5,"Mark provided the second estimate on my kitchen remodel.  After making some recommendations and suggestions, we settled on a design, and Mark and Enna did their best to work within my budget while still providing quality materials and equipment.  

Enna held my hand through picking out my countertops and cabinets, and even guided me through the purchase of my appliances.   Mark came up with a great design based on my needs and what I had to work with.   Along the way there was some stress and misunderstandings, but both Mark and Enna worked tirelessly to make me happy and come up with great resolutions.    We were in contact every day either by phone or email, and Mark even rushed over on a Saturday when I needed my gas turned back on. 

I can't say enough about the finished product.  It is one of the most beautiful kitchens I've ever seen and it's mine.   Thanks Mark and Enna"
5,"Horizon Construction and Remodeling performed a complete remodel of two bathrooms, including expansion of exterior walls to increase size of bathrooms.
The completed work went beyond expectations. Top quality results. The workers were punctual, courteous and cleaned up after themselves. We enthusiastically recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling for anyone seeking to remodel.
   We also recently added another job for this company, new railing and stairs. An awesome job again ."
5,"Horizon Constructions remodeled our guest bathroom, turning a tub into a walk-in frameless glass door shower, replacing the floor, the vanity and the toilet.  

Having had my kitchen remodeled with a different contractor, I was very impressed by the punctuality of Horizon Construction, Enna always kept me updated and in the loop of what to expect and when!  Also updated us promptly on any issues or problems.

Mark had a very keen eye for design and gave us suggestions on the materials for both the floors and the shower and also few other design elements.

Also, they replaced the glass door when Mark noticed a crack that both me and my husband missed!  We really liked the professionalism and the meticulousness that Mark and Enna showed.

It has been two months since the job was completed, but I encountered a recent problem with the shower door and contacted Enna about it.  She assured us when the job was finished that the bathroom was under warranty as well.  She is working on getting the issue addressed.  I love the follow up and the fact that they stand behind their work.

I would definitely recommend this company."
4,"We had a bathroom from 1964 completly remodeled. The original bathroom was about 10 ft. by 4-1/2 ft. with a tub/ shower and dividing wall. We had the tub removed and one wall torn out and rebuilt to expand the room by 2-1/2 ft. We had the original window removed and replaced it with a custom size window which was built into the shower walll. This required structural wall modifications and outside stucco work. We moved all of the plumbing to allow for a large tile shower to be built. This required cutting the slab foundation and installing new drain plumbing for the shower, toilet and sink. New vent pipes were required and had to be installed in the new wall and thru the roof. The shower required extensive plumbing to allow for a cieling rain can, body sprays and a hand held head. We added a fan/ light which required venting thru the roof. The shower was tiled from floor to cieling and the remainder of the room was also tiled about 40"" up from the floor. A frameless 3/8"" glass door was also installed. Two recessed lights were installed in the shower cieling along with vanity lighting."
5,"Horizon remodeled 3 average-sized bathrooms, and re-tiled a fireplace. The job included: Hot-mopping and floating cement on showers, installing tile on floors, shower, bath surround, and fireplace, installing bathtub, custom shower door and vanities, quartz countertops, sinks, toilets, faucets, fans and lighting, painting, installing baseboards, and bath accessories. 

When I first met with Mark Besnos, it was clear that he had an eye for detail. Mark had some great design ideas, and helped me pick out tile, cabinets. Everything was done very professionally; Mark drew up a detailed contract, and all changes were made with addendums. Mark also provided all of the relevant licenses and insurance documents without having to ask. In the end Mark made sure every last detail was perfect. 

Enna Eskin did an amazing job managing the project. She was always super friendly, knowledgeable, and professional, and was great about using email and text to keep in touch while I was at work. Enna kept me informed of what was happening throughout, and also let me know ahead of time when there were things that I needed to do. 

The work crews were friendly, and considerate. They worked very hard, and performed high-quality work. They did a good job of protecting my floors and furniture, and keeping the mess to a minimum. 

I love my new bathrooms and fireplace. Everything turned out beautifully, and was done on time and within budget."
4,"Early in 2012 we took three contractors' bids for a master bath remodel for our home. In addition to a price we could afford, Horizon Construction gave us some good design ideas and a feeling that they would take good care of us. They weren't the cheapest bid, but we wanted to work with someone who got all the costs out there up front, without adding on later. We felt that's how they made their bid, so we selected them for our job. 

The project would remove the small glass shower enclosure and basically unused bathtub that were there from the original home construction, and also upgrade the vanity with a nicer piece and put a granite top on it. The old toilet would be replaced. The linoleum floor would be replaced with tile which would match nicely the tile of the new shower enclosure. Since we don't use the bathtub, we opted to have more open space beside a larger shower enclosure, and no bathtub. Horizon would also install the toilet, sinks and plumbing fixtures that we furnished for the job; mount new mirrors over the vanity, install new lighting, and paint the walls.

My wife and I didn't have firm ideas on the decor, so the consultation from Horizon was very helpful. We did a session at the building materials showroom together. Once we settled on the color scheme and materials, and the fixtures that we needed to furnish to them for installation, the demolition work began and was finished very quickly and cleanly. Horizon did almost all of the work during the daytime when my wife and I were both at work. They took good care of our house and securely locked it up at the end of their day when they left.

The floor and shower tile work was perfect, and the custom glass (nothing fancy, just clear but it's just what we wanted) was installed on time, and still looks great. Part-way along Horizon suggested we consider a unique tile backsplash around the vanity, using the same accent tiles that are in the floor and the shower. They gave us a special price and although we hadn't wanted to add to our budget, we took their offer. It's a really pretty blue aqua glass tile that is the key element to the whole decoration scheme. The look we got is a bit unique, and breaks from the cookie-cutter conservative approach of the original homebuilder. Very nice and more than worth the money. If we ever sell the home, we'll point out the very custom look of the vanity.

Horizon got the building inspections and everything got approved straight off. Once the painting was done there were just a few finishing touches to get, but Horizon finished ahead of the project schedule, which is nice if your master bathroom opens onto your master bedroom and you're actually trying to live there, as we were! My son was so glad that we didn't have to share his bathroom any longer. But the bottleneck was worth it when work was complete.

Incidentally, for the new toilet, which we picked up at Costco (remember, tight budget), we bought the AMDM IntelliSeat, an electronic toilet seat (if you don't know what it is, just Google it...once you have it, you can't go back) to replace the standard seat. Although Horizon didn't seem to have experience with that product, they installed it perfectly and we love it.

About six months after the project was completed and we'd paid our final check to Horizon, the motion-sensing light switch they'd installed in the bathroom began malfunctioning. It got to be too annoying so I gave Horizon a call to see if they'd fix it for us. They reminded me that they made a full warranty on all their work, and scheduled someone to come out and work on the switch. Their man came to our house and replaced the faulty switch with a new one, which now works perfectly.

We love our bathroom and are so satisfied with Horizon's work. They are friendly professionals who follow up, deal with issues and problems when they occur, finish ahead of schedule, and back up their work."
5,"This project included total demo and reconstruction of 3 bathrooms. It included converting the master bath from a Roman tub to a walk-in shower with travertine to the top of all walls which had cathedral ceilings and a triangular window. and replacing toilets, vanities, sinks, and all fixtures. In the guest bath, the tub was replaced with a new tub and travertine on the walls. The sink, vanity and toilet were also replaced, adding an enclosure using 3/8 inch sliding doors. In the downstairs shower, old ceramic tile was removed and replaced with travertine. The toilet, vanity, and sink were also replaced. The floors in all bathrooms were removed and replaced with travertine.
 
In late September 2012, after getting an estimate from another company for our planned remodel of 2 bathrooms, a large master bath and a smaller downstairs bath, we made an appointment with Horizon Construction and Remodeling for an estimate. We had previously read reviews here on Angie’s List.
Mark arrived at the designated time, discussed with us our plans, then took measurements of the bathrooms. He also made suggestions regarding the project. He suggested that we meet with him at MSI to look at a variety of materials so he could more accurately provide an estimate.
After deciding to have Horizon do the project, we made an appointment with Mark to go over the contract, scope of work, and the payment schedule. It was determined that work could begin on October 3 but since demolition could only begin midday, We decided that early morning the following day would be best.
The demolition crew arrived as scheduled and the project was started. Demolition of the 2 bathrooms was completed in 2 days and work began on the remodel construction. Each segment of the project went smoothly. In the meantime, we went with Mark to select a marble slab for the countertops. We also met with the cabinet maker regarding the custom vanities and color of the stain.
Work progressed smoothly and ahead of schedule. Along the way, we made several changes. Enna was very helpful in accomplishing those changes and doing the paperwork involved. She is an invaluable asset to the company.
When the original project was well on its way to completion, we decided to go ahead and do the third bathroom since we had enough marble left from the slab to do the countertop. Also, the vanity in the upstairs guest bath was the same size as the downstairs bath which made the custom construction easier and more efficient.
Mark was here on a regular basis to check on progress, answer questions, and listen to our concerns. In some cases, he had noticed things that needed correction before we even brought them up.
Any remodel project, and especially one of this magnitude, is stressful. I know of several cases where projects lasted much longer than anticipated but that was not the case here. The projected completion date was January 10, 2013, however, work was completed December 15, 2012, which made our Holiday Season more enjoyable than it might have otherwise been! The master bath, which was converted from a Roman tub to a walk-in shower is amazing and the other two bathrooms are elegant as well.
Horizon Construction and Remodeling is dependable and you can expect them to do what they agreed to do. The quality of their work is good and everyone we encountered was responsible for their part of the job. My only admonition to you is that you make sure the scope of work that you sign off on includes all the things you discussed and thought would be there.
If you have a project in mind, call Horizon Remodeling and Construction and give them an opportunity to discuss it with you before you make a final decision. We are pleased with how our bathrooms came out and would not hesitate to call Horizon for another project"

They are incredible, I would give them the highest rating possible without a shadow of a doubt. They are professional and do great work every time we have had them out. Their communication is great and they are all perfectionists. I would recommend them to anyone in the future. I have never had a better experience. Mark has great vision for remodeling and always holds his work to a higher standard
Horizon Construction was outstanding to work with from beginning to end. Mark Besnos is a visionary who does exceptional work. Mark and Enna (owners) were in constant communication with continual supervision to ensure quality results.They transformed a tired 1970's condo into a beautiful living environment. We will use this professional contractor again in our future remodel."
5,It was a pleasure working with Mark and Enna and all of their crew members. Mark and Enna went out of their way to find just the right fixtures and French doors that  I envisioned for my new master bedroom. I am especially happy with the double doors that were hung on my new closet. I was very pleased with how much attention was given to the finest details and how quickly they were able to complete the construction.
5,"We enjoyed working with Mark and Enna to remodel and update our master bathroom. Mark was especially helpful during the planning phase when he listened patiently to our endless questions and provided useful information and suggestions that helped us reach decisions about project materials and stylistic choices. After work began, Mark and Enna continued to be very responsive to us regarding scheduling aspects of the work and finalizing decisions about the details. Throughout the process, they stressed that the goal was to create a master bathroom that we would really enjoy, even if that meant occasionally changing our minds about details or adding new work at times. This was our first major renovation project, and we feel that Mark, Enna and their team did a great job guiding us through it and creating a great new room to enhance our home."
5,"Our kitchen & Den was recently remodeled and everyone we dealt with @ SOD Home Group was nice, professional, and performed quality work. 
The entire staff was committed to ensuring that the experience met our expectations. Whenever we had a question or concern on anything they addressed it immediately. We would highly recommend SOD Home Group for your renovations."
5,"From start to finish, SOD Home Group was phenomenal to work with, and they went above and beyond in designing and building the addition of our dreams. Everyone we worked with (our designers, our carpenter, production supervisor, office staff) were all so friendly, competent and professional. It was as painless an experience as possible, given that we remodeled our whole house while living in it.
They really pulled that off !"
5,"They did an excellent job! We are very satisfied with the price, quality, and professional installation. They remodeled the kitchen in a timeframe that they promised. I’m looking forward to starting the bathroom remodeling project in a few months. Everything in our kitchen matches the theme we were going for.
I would recommend them to anyone needing to update their kitchen!"
5,"We recently decided to sell our home and needed some work done quickly ( kitchen, bathroom and master bedroom). I contacted SOD Home Group and as expected, they made it happen. We had the teams out within a week. And, most importantly, the work was still at the same high caliber as it always is. They finished everything in 3 weeks. I will certainly use them again as I know they do quality job. We love our home so much that we feel bad to sell it now."
5,"I am thoroughly pleased with SOD HOME GROP From design creation to the project manager I can not praise them enough for their professionalism and attention to detail. Once we agreed on the initial aspects of the job, work began. Our project manager was open to our ideas, provided many thoughts of his own, and made time on multiple occasions to go over selection of materials and to review the design. 
I tell EVERYONE I know how consistently fantastic this company is. Our room addition looks better than we ever imagined it could be!"
5,"We were looking for a  local reputable remodeling company to renovate our entire home. Thankfully, we came across SOD HOME GROUP Company, who proven to be an expert in home remodeling and interior designing. They did a fantastic job and gave our home a stylish and sophisticated look. We had a great experience with this company. Highly recommended! Charles Martin"
5,"They just finished to renovate our guest house and backyard  for us and it turned out great. Extremely professional. From the very beginning, he provided a line by line estimate so that there was never any confusion about what needed to be done. We never had to worry that he was going come back to us and ask for more money. Communication was excellent. I felt confident that I could reach them by phone or text at any time. When unexpected issues arose, they were quick to do everything they could to see that it was taken care of in a timely manner. Would absolutely recommend and will use again in the future."
5,"This company is amazing. Their Crews showed up on time fully equipped and did an amazing job restoring everything. After the demolition and the removal of the our guest house they set the equipment up in a very clean and workable set up. They are very knowledgeable and very educational. They took the time to educate my wife and myself about every step and how every step was going to happen and the goals that had to be met before each step could move on. When they left the house each day it look they had never even been here. They were so meticulous with their clean up, it was amazing. I would recommend them highly to everybody!"
5,"Active participation, attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of both quality and timely project execution are just some of the attributes this team exemplifies! I have had the privilege of being awarded several projects over the years and have thoroughly enjoyed working with SOD Home Group Team! I look forward to even more successful projects with these professionals and your home could be their next masterpiece! Thanks a lot!"
5,"The renovations of our three bathrooms, kitchen and Guest House went great and the transformations were amazing! I HIGHLY recommend Christian ! He is timely, fair priced, easy to work with, meticulous and does great work. Nowadays , it's hard to trust someone in your house. I have to say he earned our trust even enough that we left him with a key to our house while we went on a vacation and came home to our beautiful home! We are very pleased!"
5,"Oren and his team were amazing and I could not give them a higher recommendation!! We had an attic project that involved a bathroom and bedroom, and creating a new room in an old, very tight space. Oren provided us a response via email, saw the space and provided an estimate within 2 days, then started the project and completed it within another 3-4 weeks! His work is beautiful, his estimate was right in the middle and far less than we were expecting (and he stayed right on budget!) and his team was extremely professional, timely and responsive to our questions. Could not say more good things about SOD HOME GROUP. This is exactly what we wanted!!"
5,Oren is very professional and quick to get a hold with when you need things done. I work with him to fix some issue with my condo when i was putting it on the market. And still working with him on the house I am about to buy with the inspection issues. He gives very reasonable prices to fix the problem.
5,"Our Garage conversion designer, was amazing. The only agenda was that we create spaces that fit us and our lifestyle, and that we be thrilled with the outcome. They never pushed us and always listened to us and responded to what we wanted. Honestly, he is the consummate designer and professional. SOD HOME GROUP gets a standing ovation."
5,"Don't look anywhere else. To say that my job didn't go exactly according to plan would be an understatement and Mario and his entire team were pros from start to finish. Our job was a demo of our old guest house and rebuilding, designing and installing a beautiful new guest house under the watchful eye of Mario and the team. The consistent communication from Mario was also a huge plus as the home is a complete remodel and I'm rarely on site. Finally, remember that you get what you pay for; there may be cheaper contractors out there, but there aren't any better - take that to heart."
5,"I can't thank SOD Home group enough. They were organized from the onset. Their presentation was better than anyone else that my family and I looked requested bids from. They were great through every step of the process. From demolition, to installing/building everything, to having it all completed. I enjoyed the process of it all. Awesome."
5,"Oren from SOD Home Group , led our house renovation project over a period of five weeks.  Oren and his team were responsive, professional and accommodating of our requirements - from the initial estimate meeting up to the finish of the project. We even added items to the original scope, along the way, and they were still able to complete on time and on budget.  
As the project came to an end, we had to do a detailed quality check ourselves, but once we pointed out any outstanding finishes, they finished the job to perfection. We would definitely work with Oren and team again for any future renovation needs."
5,"This started out as a project to make my mother in laws home ADA compliant, and we ended up updating the entire home. It seemed logical after discussions with Mario, and so we moved forward. The project was completed very quickly due to our timeline and the results are phenomenal! Working with contractor Mario was a pleasure. He is honest and hard-working and is a complete contrast to my previous experiences. Will use them for all my future projects."
5,"After interviewing several companies for the room addition project, we hired SOD Home Group. We were very impressed with the vision, professionalism, and ideas from our sales representative Mario . We valued all the detailed and self-explanatory estimates and budget, including the schedule that was presented to us before we signed the contract. When the remodeling project started, we were updated daily via e-mails and additional visits by Mario. The people who worked at the house on the project were respectful of our house and they always cleaned at the end of each day. They also guided us with all the interior design with the selection of light fixtures, floor tiles, and paint color/style choices. At the end of the remodeling project, it addressed any detail that we needed additional attention on.
Our room addition turned out to be a success and it’s our favorite room in my home :)"
5,"Oren is fantastic! His team seriously saved my butt. I hired them, to remodel my kitchen and 3 bathrooms, and am so very glad that I did. They worked very hard to deliver on a timeline that was, I'm sure, terrible- but they really came through for me. He's gone out of his way to make a difficult situation less stressful. Oren is extremely professional and I would highly recommend him. He's clearly very knowledgeable, and has been very communicative. Seriously can't thank him enough for bailing me out of this mess"
5,We had needed to replace our bathroom. We set up a meeting with SOD Home Group team. Oren was extremely professional. He explained the process and our choices and was very pleasant and professional. The project was handled very professionally - the workers were punctual and cleaned up after themselves daily. The project was completed on time for exactly what Oren had quoted in the estimate. He was easy to get in touch with if we had questions. The Bathroom looks amazing. This company stands by its warranty and its word. We were thrilled with the service we received them and would highly recommend this company.
5,"Today, I met the designer who’ll be my right hand planning our kitchen and 2 bathrooms renovation. The designer was very informative and guided me in choosing my desired design and suggested us to think about how we’ll be preparing meals, and consider schedule before setting a date for work to begin. I am very excited for the results! Absolutely excellent customer service!"
5,"What a fresh breath of air speaking to Mario. His honesty and non sales approach to helping me understand the process
After thinking about an ADU for such a long time we finally started looking into it the last 5 months. We spoke to a lot of contractors and really felt comfortable with the knowledge and value this company had. We could not be happier with the result highly recommend!!!"
5,We had a major large bath remodel....Every pat of the job from the virtual design to punch out was handled without any issues.  I was most impressed  how they did not nickel and dime me for minor changes. .  Special thanks to Mario who obviously have renovated hundreds of baths
5,"Full bath basement project finished on budget. The crew was Very punctual, good quality work and cleaned up every evening when finished. Project turned out good and I would recommend"
5,"Absolutely the best ADU contractor ( well
At least we think they are ) . They did a spectacular job creating a 900 sqft 2bed, 1.5bath dwelling unit on my house earlier in 2021. From designing the floorplans to handling the paperwork and picking the right materials to the actual construction, I was beyond pleased with their knowledge and expertise at each step. The finished product superseded our expectations. I feel fully confident in giving a high recommendation for this company for your ADU project. You Rock !!"
5,SOD Home Group went above and beyond and delivered better than what I could have imagined. They stand by their work and I will be working with them on my future projects. Thank you for getting our room addition done in time for the holidays.
5,"SOD Home Group  is definitely one of the premier renovation contractors in CA. These guys aren't your typical contractors who show up in an old truck, 2 hours late, and do the job half-ass. They're pros. Seriously. Down to their branding, customer service and quality of work. You get what you pay for and SHG is well worth your money if you want the job done right."
5,"We were quite pleased with SOD Home Group - from the initial consultation, changes made based on budget and preference, help with picking colors, patterns and materials. Everyone involved was pleasant and patient with us. 
The finished work looks great, and the few items that have required 'tweaks' post project have been handled quickly and cheerfully.
Will use them again, I'm sure!"
5,"It was a pleasure working with Oren and his crew, we would definitely call them again. They were in touch with us almost everyday letting us know what was going on and if we had any questions. All of the crews that came were professional, flexible and thorough, any issues were promptly taken care of without fuss. We ended up spending more than we had anticipated mainly because of Oren’s enthusiasm and the designs they prepared for us were outstanding, it was hard to say no. The finished work is beautiful, we are very happy!"
5,"as a woman, I appreciate how respectful Oren was when providing me with an estimate, going over the contract, and discussing the end results. Although I knew nothing about room addition, he did not make me feel dumb regardless of how many questions I had or explanations I required. He was thorough and transparent. He complied with my requests and made sure I was 100% comfortable with moving forward. I was impressed how quick and efficiently the team worked. After 10 bids and lots of reference checking, they were among the best in pricing, customer service, and job completion."
5,"SOD Home Group completed a major remodel and home addition project for us.  We interviewed a few other contractors, but SOD stood out because of their fair pricing, confidence and professionalism.  We interviewed two other home owners who had used SOD in the past and they had great things to say about Oren and his group.  They transformed our ageing 1600 sq.ft. home into an amazing 2900 sq. ft. that is absolutely breathtaking.  Since this was our dream home being built, we were very involved in selecting materials for the project and the SOD team was very accommodating. They also worked well with other contractors like HVAC, fire sprinkler and sidewalk.   They executed the job to perfection while coordinating with the city for inspections. They did a great job with everything from the laying of the new foundation, framing, electrical, plumbing.  The best part was that they did an excellent job of finishing including flooring, painting, etc.  They were very responsive to fixing minor touch-ups even after we had moved in.  I would whole heartedly recommend SOD."
5,SOD Home Group folks worked on our bedroom remodel. The work was done on time and the quality was great.
5,"I wanted to do a tech update and remodel to my home in Saratoga. The home was outdated for my style. The SOD Home Group team could handle everything. I had a designer that I wanted to use, but they didn’t pan out and SOD Home Group hooked me up with another designer who did an amazing job. They worked together well, so my experience was very easy. Oren kept me up to date as far as they progress. His experience as a General Contractor made me feel at ease. He really knows what he’s doing. We opened the space up and did a lot of updates, including the pool, which needed to be updated and repaired. The result is exactly what I wanted, and I didn’t have to stay out of my home longer than estimated which I was nervous about. Everything turned out great! Worth every penny!"
5,"We were considering remodeling our entire house for several years now and we just never had the money to. When we could finally afford it, we were so spooked about hiring a contractor. Every story we heard was so terrifying! Everyone we knew remodeled got ripped off, the contractor did a horrible job and had to redo the project, or simply took their money and never showed up. We went on a couple of different routes to deeply search and find the right contractor for our project. After meeting a couple of them, we signed a contract with SOD Home Group. They had great appearance online and when we asked if they can take us to a few of their completed and ongoing projects, Oren did not hesitate! Oren immediately agreed. We remodeled our kitchen, bathrooms, living room, dining room, backyard, front yard, and added a new laundry room. Oren’s crew was so respectful, clean, and always on time. Living in your home through construction can be a little bothersome and disturbing. Not to mention that you have no privacy but SOD Home Group crew gave us as much privacy as possible and also disturbed me as little as possible since we work from home (since this COVID started). The quality and craftsmanship they provided is just superb! If you are looking for an honest, and trustworthy contractor definitely call SOD home Group! Oren and the team made what we thought would be a horrible experience into a marvelous, easy-going! we’ll certainly be contacting them down the road for all my remodeling projects."
5,"I took 5 estimates for our remodeling project that included the garage, kitchen, 2 bathrooms. SOD Home Group was by far the fairest bid and the most knowledgeable contractor. Oren was my project manager. Unlike one of the other contractors who completely disregarded my ideas, Oren listened to my ideas and helped me realize them. The project ran into some delays as Oren worked to clear through permitting challenges. Thank goodness that Oren was so diligent in resolving those challenges. Oren and I were in constant contact from the beginning of the year until mid-July, when the job was completed (and I mean constant communication, daily). The consistent communication was also very appreciated. At the end of the day, I felt I could trust Oren, and that is a truly rare thing. If you need help with any remodeling project, give these guys a call — they are good."
5,"The best way I can explain my experience with this company is that everything was done marvelously. One thing Oren promised us from day one is that we will get custom work. That’s exactly what we received - custom remodeling in all matters of the project. Oren helped us hire a custom cabinet maker. They did custom kitchen cabinets, linen closets and our bathroom vanities. Next we needed custom doors and windows since our house was so old and we had to fit all sizes, so once again Oren helped us hire a custom door and window maker. Since we have a large space and the flooring runs through pretty much both top and bottom level and we didn’t want to rip out the old woods, we had to hire someone to make us new custom flooring to match the old one that they had put in close to 90 years ago. We also ended up redoing all of our electric lines, plumbing lines, drain lines and gas lines. Oren helped us hire a plaster specialist who could duplicate the plaster texture that they had done many years ago. He also could help us find the company to duplicate the old plaster base and ceiling molding. Because this was such an old house and large house, we had to get the right contractor to do custom remodeling work. Oren could find us all the local specialists who work in older homes and can duplicate the quality and craftsmanship of what they had used earlier on. We had a lot of woodwork which needed to be customized, not just installation, but also custom making the actual moldings from scratch. One of the best things about Oren was that he had the answers to a lot of our questions. But what I like most about him is that he didn’t get scared of a challenge and in fact pursuited head-on. If there was something that he didn’t know, he wouldn’t just say, well that’s not my problem. He would help us find the right person or company to do that. I’m truly grateful that we could find Oren and his company to help us renovate this property. The house looks marvelous but the best thing about it is that you can’t tell that it was done now it still looks like it was built 100 years ago. What Oren could do for us was that he gave us great ideas to keep the old charm of the house but still update the house where we have a smart home and smart thermostat and the ability to control a lot of different aspects from our phones or tablets. I truly believe that we spent a premium on this renovation. But it was definitely worth it because the house looks marvelous and the property values since we have done the renovation have gone through the roof. Oren was definitely the most expensive contractor that we had interviewed but he was also the most understanding and the most caring. Also another great thing about him was that he was always accessible to us. Whether we called him, texted him or emailed him he would always get back to us immediately. I have heard of horror stories from other clients and contractors. I’m glad that this was not our experience."
5,"I’ve been through my share of remodels and almost all the experiences took more time, more money...you know the story. And then my mother’s condo had water damage, which was uninhabitable. Despite solid insurance, the moment the tests came back positive for mold and sewage, we knew this was going to be a complete move out, demo and remodel. I had 5 bids come back and chose Oren with SOD Hoe Group. He and his team are my heroes. Open communication, direct eye contact, honest opinions, quick problem solving, and most of all, they took care of us when COVID hit and the building shut down to all contractors. Even though we had weeks left on our schedule to get the job done, I could have the Board give us 5 days so that my mother could move back in and they made it happen with no changes to the original renderings. Oren’s communication was impeccable, with immediate responses to every question and request. The craftsmanship is PERFECTION! Thank you, Oren!!!"
5,"We started our complete remodeling project by remodeling the kitchen and bathrooms and because it went much better than we expected… we remodeled all the other sections of the house (front and back yard, pool, garage and more…). Oren helped us to select all the finishing materials and fixtures that we needed for the entire remodeling, and his workers worked every day and they completed the project on time. Our huge remodeling project went so well that the house got a fresh look and feel. Oren and the rest of the team did a very professional job and we are very pleased with the results. We recommend them to anyone considering a remodeling project."
5,"Oren and his team at SOD Home Group were beyond excellent regarding my home remodeling project. They were thorough, detailed and kept me informed regarding most of the important parts of the remodeling the entire time. I am mainly pleased with the fresh look and open space of our house which got a fresh look and wide open space. It didn’t matter to us, but there was a bit of a disconnect between the sales pitch timeline and the actual timeline for the demo and installation. I wanted quality, and that’s what I got."
5,"SOD Home Group made our long time vision come true. Overall, we knew what we wanted when we decided to re-landscape our front and back yard, but going from head to paper to reality doesn’t always happen mainly because we wanted too much that at the end would not look good. Lucky for us, Oren, with his exceptional experience and knowledge, could make it happen. Oren’s knowledge as an arborist made it easy for us to communicate our ideas while taking advantage of his design expertise. He was creative in working with our budget, his expert crew was hardworking, conscientious, and respectful of Covid protocol, and Oren continues to follow up to make sure our garden is thriving. We could not be happier with our new front yard, and are looking forward to having SOD Home Group back for future projects."
5,"We have been dreaming for a few years about how we will design the kitchen, what will it have and how it will serve us. We wanted it to be and look no less than perfect. We worked closely with Mr. Oren on the initial design (which after a few corrections and meetings, become the final one) and he gave us many beautiful ideas and solutions to select from and to have as part of the remodeling. At the end, we are happy, very much with his design, work, time frame to finish the remodeling job and his super happy personality. Oren is a pleasure person to work with. He always made sure that our vision of what we want… will matches what he can do and now we are in love with the new kitchen. Very high skilled company and we recommend to anyone that in case they want any beautiful remodeling job with a truly honest company and excellent customer support... they will have to contact this company."
5,"I highly recommend Oren, SOD Home Group! He is very knowledgeable, answered all my questions (and more), very professional, and responsive. He spent over 3 hours showing me all the possibilities that can be done to my kitchen, if you know little about all the little details about remodeling your home (like I do), he will explain it to you in terms that you will completely understand and turns your ideas into this beautiful 3D design. Oren also had great ideas and recommendations on how to attain your dream home. He knows house histories, and why houses were built in a certain way! He is unlike any other contractor that will just throw out random price of how much the renovation could cost you without showing you hard proof. I’m a visual learner, so when Oren made this amazing 3D design using the exact measurement of my kitchen, it blew my mind. It even gave me a chance to actually change few things that did not quite look right with kitchen. Most importantly, he will make sure you will enjoy and have fun designing your home. Oren, you are the best!"
5,"We are really proud and happy to give this rating and review to SOD Home Group based on our excellent experience with Oren, the team of people who worked at our house, and the company. We really value his professionalism. Oren proved us to be very honest, quick understanding person and mainly good listener (based on the fact that he made it happen with our budget). Oren heard our concerns and goals and was very realistic about what to expect for taking on an addition project. Oren also provided us with several additional ideas that we didn’t know we can implement them at all. We decided to hire Oren and his team immediately after we went over his estimate and 3D drawings of the remodeling project. Now that they finished our addition remodeling project (6 months after), we can write clearly that we highly recommend Oren for any major projects for your home."
5,"We hired SOD Home Group to handle a large remodel of my home. Oren and his crew removed a large load-bearing wall and reworked my old living room and kitchen into an open concept floor plan. He also had some great ideas to cleanly route our TV/media equipment into the new coat closet that he built for us. Ultimately, all of our concerns and requests were addressed. My husband and I panicked when our new hardwood floors were incredibly squeaky, and he had his subcontractors come back to fix the problem. When our new kitchen cabinets from Home Depot arrived crooked, his company expertly solved the issue. On top of that, Oren was able to complete our project several weeks earlier than we were hoping. We are expecting to hire Oren again when we will be ready to execute our next home renovation project."
5,"We had creative SOD home Group redo all of our home and due to the COVID-19, it took longer then we thought it would but the final remodeling work is stunning. My husband was very specific about what he wanted and Oren with his professional teams were able to deliver it beyond our expectations. Working with Oren was very easy, straightforward and they were always professional. What made this remodeling safe and well was that Oren made sure that each day the teams will clean as much as they could and that they will wear masks and gloves while working. We don’t think that we will ever going to use any other contractor after having such a significant experience with them. They are definitely our go to."
5,"Oren and his crew just finished the complete remodeling of our new home. The work took several months and during this time they remodeled each space including the kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, entry etc… Oren started with the 3D design and after we agreed on that phase, he came up with execution plan including the prices. The work was managed by him daily and according to the schedule that he planned for us. They informed us on every step of the work while Oren made sure that the price will remain within the agreed budget. We really love the new remodeling and our home got a brand fresh look. We highly recommend Oren and each one of his crew for any remodeling project."
5,"SOD Home Group is the BEST home improvement company by far!! We worked with Oren and his crews of people and right from the beginning of the work, Oren was very professional, honest, hardworking man and good communicator. He always was on time and he made sure that the people will deliver the best results in the work. Our project (which was a complete kitchen remodeling) was completed on time and within the agreed budget. We will use SOD Home Group for all of our future projects."
5,"SOD Home Group did a major renovation in our home, removing two load-bearing walls holding the second floor, remodeling our kitchen, the downstairs bathroom, family room and the roof, a complete remodel. Their price was the second highest out of the five estimates we got, but I was looking for a contractor to provide a high quality and hassle free remodel. I really appreciated the communication via the WhatsApp Oren installed on my phone, which made our communication throughout the design stage and the actual project very easy. There were a few minor hiccups with the color of the grout and some other final finishing, but Oren took care of them to our satisfaction. SOD Home Group is definitely for those who want a thorough professional contractor that provides a high-quality hassle free remodel."
5,"We contracted with SOD Home Group to totally update and remodel a large part of our house that basically included the hallway, complete Kitchen, guest bathroom and 2 additional bathrooms and bedrooms. Oren was honest about the work and gave us a very realistic estimate and a time frame of the completion date for the entire work at our house. This was an excellent plus because all the other contractors that we brought in to our house were just trying to get the remodeling job signed and would probably up charge us later. Oren was very communicative from the first day and a very easy person to reach if we had any question or concern about the work progress or even if we were interesting in a minor change. The teams of workers were respectful and efficient, mainly since we had to complete the job during this COVID-19 timing and to move in with the family during the process. While there were some issues that raised during the work, Oren could get the remodeling job completed and we’re thrilled with our new home. This was really our first and largest remodeling project, so we felt it went as smoothly as possible. Our only issue was the tiles we ended up choosing for the floor and shower were not the best quality. We wish that had been flagged to us sooner since we spent a small fortune on the remodel, but the bathroom looks beautiful and we’d highly recommend shopping around for tile."
5,"We went over many estimates for our complete ADU project we needed to do since we work from home because of COVID. The Addition included: kitchen and a small bathroom. We hesitate on who should we hire for this, as we know stories when the remodeling projects not finished or done correctly. All the contractors we met were too pushy to make us sign, and we didn’t want to move forward with anyone because of that. We met Oren from SOD Home Group. he was very friendly, professional and accessible throughout the entire project. He really did a fabulous work from the design to the demolition and finally the installation. His team came every day; and they completed the work on the promised time. Oren has done the best remodeling in my house, hands-down! And we will definitely contact him soon to also renovate our other house! Trust, friendliness, and professionalism are absolutely what you will get when choosing this company."
5,"SOD Home Group was strongly recommended to me by a co-worker who stated that the company was exceptionally reliable and did a quality job. At first, I thought their price was a bit high but because of the recommendation; I chose to hire them to remodel my entire house. They were great from start to finish. I was worried about bringing a team into the house during COVID, but they were great. They wore masks; they were super respectful and treated my house as a living space and not as a construction zone. The crew was extremely courteous and kind. One of the major reasons I chose to hire SOD Home Group was because I was assured by Oren, the company owner, that he will manage my project directly and that he would be involved in all stages of the project. Oren stood by his word and made sure to always keep me updated throughout all the stages of my project. He made sure I was always aware of the upcoming schedule and verified that I always had all the required materials to keep the project running smoothly and seamlessly. The quality of work came out as expected, stunning! The Kitchen and bathrooms were completely transformed and I feel like I am living in a brand new home. I am so impressed with Oren and SOD Home Group. This project came out better than I could have ever imagined, and I couldn’t be happier."
5,"Oren and the guys at SOD Home Group did a stellar job on our big home remodeling project. We added a second story to our Los Angeles home, nearly doubling it in size. We also moved a kitchen and living room wall and completely gutted our kitchen. We basically rebuilt the entire home, while doing our best to change the character of our home.We had tried to start this process several years back, running into snags and unethical contractors along the way, and are so happy that we landed in the capable hands of this team. At every step along the way, we felt honestly communicated with and cared for on a personal level. Besides this, all the subcontractors they worked with were top-notch and considerate of our neighbors. Not only did they do a remarkable job and make our house the talk of the neighborhood, they went above and beyond to really be sure we were always 100% happy with all the work being done. Even with the pandemic hitting right in the middle of our project, they finished within our original timeline as promised. I would without a doubt recommend them for any project you have, large or small. I’m attaching a few photos to show the scale of our undertaking. Enjoy!"
5,"I hired Oren and SOD to do a major construction and remodel project back in 2015. We received a number of bids and went with SOD b/c they were most competitive, organized, and responsive. Oren took the time to understand our project and vision for the remodel. He said ""once you're a customer, you're always a customer"" and stayed true to that statement. The project progressed according to schedule, which is rare for a project of this size. My 3rd party architect made some mistakes (not SOD's fault) that resulted in change orders, permit delays, and additional expenses -- which Oren ultimately waived in good faith. The project ultimately finished on time and according to budget. We're now 5+ years later and Oren is still committed to ""make it right"" without question as issues arise."
5,"We hired Oren, the contractor for ADU Garage Conversion. We went with him and his team on such a large remodeling project because he is ‘the’ specialist in that area. They also gave me very competitive price. Oren and his team were a real pleasure to work with. Oren and the team that worked at our house were always on time, respectful, disciplined and responsible. The project was finished ahead of the promised schedule and outcome is great. Big thanks to Oren. very honest and helpful person. Highly recommend SOD Home Group!"
5,"SOD Home Group is a company that lets you sleep at night.  They take on your project like they are doing it for themselves.  From the person answering the phone to Oren crunching the numbers to Eden who managed my project and visited our home daily and made sure that the workers are given the right attention to all the details. SOD Home Group become like a family to me who take care of you every step of the way.  I am remodeling my entire home, complete with alternative systems, room additions, and interior/exterior finishes.  Six months of being displaced and watching my home being rebuilt from start to finish.  I made the right decision when selecting SOD Home Group.  They are professional, experienced, and personable.  Half way through the job and I’m still feeling good about my decision."
5,"Oren, Eden and Daniel were wonderful professional people and that we hired for our room addition at our house and to our kitchen project. They were very interested in suggestions we had and very amenable to incorporating them. Nothing of the project was too much for them. They took each and any of our ideas and implemented them into the work while making sure to stay in the range of the budget. The room addition project that we hired them for was to remodel the kitchen and living room space at our house. We will be very happy to hire them again in the future. They are real professional people."
5,"We recently had a room addition built at our house. Our addition project started before the COVID-19 situation and it was managed by Oren, and we couldn’t have asked for more skilled and communicative contractor. From the beginning, he was with us, guiding us on how to plan out our addition that will fit our budget, and explaining us all the stages and processes involved. Oren set the timeline for the start of the construction, and what would be involved, and he also provided us with many ideas on best practices that would result in a highest end quality for our budget. The working teams were professional and always polite, and they were very receptive and responsive to any of our questions and issues we had. From A to Z, the addition project was perfect, and on target. We are very happy with the final results. We will definitely be calling up Oren for any future remodels, and we would not hesitate to recommend him to friends and family."
5,"Oren at SOD Home Group is highly recommended! He seriously was able to fix the problems of another contractor who decided to stop in the middle due to complicity of the project. Most of all he can do many things with a high degree of quality. This is HIGHLY recommended handyman! Thanks, Oren for all the great work you have done in my home and will definitely hire again."
5,"What a complete pleasure to work with! SOD Home Group were reasonable prices, efficient, honest and cared about my home. They did such an outstanding job! They were ON TIME and super knowledgeable.  We really love hosting our friends and family in our home, our kitchen was a separate room facing the backyard, so we had architectural plans made to add a large family room on the expense of our backyard, and open the kitchen to the new family room. It took SOD Home Group about 3 months to finish the job and we couldn’t be happier.  If you are looking for honest and talented contractors at fair prices, then SOD Home Group is exactly what you are looking for."
5,"Oren and his skilled team at SOD Home Group were the most professionals, polite and skilled people while Oren the contractor was such a great supervisor that we worked with during our large remodeling project that included the kitchen, bathrooms, and outdoor landscape project that was ended last week. The high quality and the installation of all the parts of the new kitchen were done as Oren promised to us and were finished exactly on time. Oren ideas and help were very useful from the layout design aspect. They made our dream kitchen a reality."
5,"Oren at SOD Home Group did a STUNNING remodeling job for us. We basically redid our entire first floor that included the kitchen, guest bathroom, living room and dining room area and all of it looks gorgeous. Oren and his team of people were easy, polite, and honest people to work with, super responsive, and very affordable related to everybody else. They also painted the entire spaces, installed washer dryer hookups and installed our new wood flooring. We will hire them for forthcoming projects. Can’t wait!"
5,"I only have the highest praises for Oren, and his work. From the beginning, Oren displayed so much warmth and sincerity towards us. From the first consultation, he gave tremendous time and detail to what we could anticipate if we were to hire him for our project, a full bathroom remodel. He was never in a rush, so open to conversation, and actively listened to what our expectations were for our project. Oren always carried himself with utmost professionalism, while establishing and maintaining a personal relationship, with constant, open and timely communication. The entire process was incredibly smooth. Oren gave us direction each step of the way, allowing us to choose our style and shop within our budget. Everything was done is a timely fashion and the project was finished so quickly! Every person involved in the project was professional, and we did not feel that our privacy was invaded at any point. We could not be happier with the final result of the bathroom. We would recommend Oren to anyone looking to do any remodeling or reconstruction, and would definitely work with him in the future! Thank you Oren!"
5,"I'm writing this review because me and my husband were very happy with the work that they did!. Oren is a great person to work with and we felt that he is a professional person that tries hard to make us happy by doing a lot of things that we never included in the job even. The workers also were happy and they mentioned several times that they want to do this bathroom remodeling project on the best side. the project that they did for us included the new floor and replacing the shower with a large bathtub with stone walls all over the tub. In addition to that, we replaced all the light fixtures and the outlets/switches as well. We love the new bathroom and we do recommend this company."
5,"We hired SOD Home Group to convert our upstairs living room into a fully permitted bedroom, and we cannot be happier with how everything went, including the remodeling process and the outcome results. We truly recommend asking for Oren as the assigned project manager. Oren is smart, very professional and super reliable man when it comes to construction, communication and execution. We had few setbacks during the remodeling work and Oren stood up during all of them placing our priorities and comments on the top. The working crew who was assigned and worked on our remodeling project were very well trained, clean, honest, and they completed the remodeling project on the time frame Oren and his office set that. We honestly know that If we will ever have another remodeling project to do… We will definitely contact and hire SOD Home Group and mainly Oren."
5,"We had an excellent experience with SOD Home Group with this current remodeling project. Oren and his team remodeled and upgraded the kitchen at my house. Oren was the project manager and he was absolutely amazing person, very helpful and pleasant, answered all of our questions and was able to save us some money with his valuable advises. The remodeling project went smoothly, and he finished all of it on the promised time and within agreed price. We love the new kitchen, looks beautiful!"
5,"SOD Home Group transformed our house into a stunning new look and feel. Each and Every part and detail of this complete remodeling project was way far exceeded all of our expectations. The honesty, high quality of work, trustworthiness of all the working team members were beyond superior. Oren’s communications skills were the main plus and that on top of the staff from the main office who gave us the perfect feeling that this project is being done at her house! They all made sure that each and every stage of the work will be done no less than perfect. A full 10 thumbs up we want to give them without thinking twice."
5,"We had a really horrible experience with the previous contractor that started our project… and just left it in the middle due to workers problems… we were so lost that we didn’t know what to do. When we were referred to SOD Home Group, we really hoped for at least a better experience. Now that our project is finished… all we can say is that it was amazing and we are extremely happy!! SOD Home Group really knows what they are doing, they took over the project, listened to our original ideas and vision and stepped in right away to do it the right way! our master bathroom and kitchen start to take shape very fast and they went above and beyond their promises just to please us and to deliver what we wanted. Everything was done in a professional way and in a very timely manner while making sure to keep us in the loop during the remodeling process. We will be calling SOD Home Group for any future remodeling projects we will have. They were amazing!"
5,"We could not be happier with our recently remodeled home and our experience with Oren and his team. Before embarking on our remodel, we talked to many different contractors and while we liked a lot of them, we felt that SOD Home Group was the only one giving us a truly honest assessment of what was possible and the cost of it all. From our first conversation with Oren, we had complete trust— something we didn’t feel with many of the other companies out there. He’s a perfectionist, and anything that was not to our liking in any way he immediately fixed. Any unforeseen problem was handled in a way that actually left us happier than we were before. Their attention to detail and quality is incredible, and it shows in the work they do. Oren and his team transformed our house into an incredible place, and it was a pleasure working with them."
5,"We’ve used SOD Home Group for two projects 1 year apart. The first time we hired them, it was for a full back landscaping project - design, irrigation, plantings. Oren did an amazing work, kept to the promised (upon) budget and finished the entire project as scheduled. We loved the yard and received many complements. This year we decided to build a new pool, which required all new landscaping work. This time around, in addition to having design, irrigation and planting needs, our ideas included fencing, benches, BBQ island as well with slopes and varying elevations. Oren was amazing and he pulled all of our ‘preferred’ and ‘want’ into a stunning design plan that met our budget and Oren and his team executed the design perfectly. Once again, in addition to the enjoyment we receive from our beautiful backyard, our friends and family have nothing but complements as well.  We highly recommend SOD Home Group."
5,We just finished our remodeling project with SOD Home Group who did a stunning remodeling work at our house by completely demolished the existing kitchen and to build the new designed one. Oren was the main person that we dealt with during the entire work and he made sure that everything will go according to the plan. He also managed all the people who worked at the house (close to 15 different people) while the office made sure that all the orders and deliveries will be handled in the most professional way. We wanted to have our new kitchen project finished before the new year and Oren promised that it will and we can write here that he did fulfill his promise. highly recommended company!
5,We hired them during the COVID-19 to remodel our kitchen and living room. Oren managed the remodeling project from start to finish while he MADE sure to follow all the safety measures including the cleaning after each day of work. the project took a little longer than we thought but we totally understand that. the delay caused due to the extra safety measured that they took. Highly recommended company mainly during this hard time.
5,"I can't say enough about how great SOD Home Group was to work with. I priced out kitchens everywhere and decided IKEA was the best product for the price, but was intimidated by the designing, and installing process. Once I discovered SOD Home Group I knew it would be helpful, but after going through the process, I can't imagine doing it without them. Their design was great and the detailed measurements, pictures and parts list were so important. Whenever people see our kitchen, I make sure to tell them about SOD Home Group as I believe they were such an integral part of making our kitchen reno successful. We saved thousands of dollars going with IKEA, so it was well worth the investment in SOD Home Group to make the process so much easier. Thank you SOD Home Group!"
5,"I found SOD Home Group and its team who managed by Oren to be a very experienced, knowledgeable and creative asset to the remodeling project of our kitchen, living room, laundry room and guest bathroom. During the work, Oren was available for all of our questions/concerns and he also helped us with all the issues that were raised up during the work and we are very satisfied with our beautiful new remodeling project."
5,"As a Realtor my responsibility is to my clients. When my sellers wanted to do improvements to their investment property in preparation for Sale we chose SOD Builders for the job they were AMAZING! they took all the headache out of the renovation they acquired the permits, offered insight to the design and materials and even when we hit budget snag they were able to accommodate David and his team were super professional and skilled. The property sold before ever hitting the market while under construction and was over our target price all cash 7 day close. Everybody was happy. Will definitely call on them when I have another project. And so should you."
5,"Oren at SOD Home Group was very professional and helpful from the early stage of the project all the way to end of it. The customer service that was given to me was impeccable. During the work, I had several adjustments and changes and Oren addressed all of them without questioning any of them. I would recommend SOD Home Group and Oren’s staffs in the future."
5,"After purchasing our second investment house, we wanted to update the house since it was still stuck in the in the old remodeling style. We did not know where to start or what to do and after a lot of research we were referred to SOD Home Group by a friend that did their entire house with them. We didn't know what to expect. After 30 mins of our meeting we were in love with David’s ideas and suggestions to improve the layout and finishes of our new kitchen, master bathroom and guest bathroom. He was very professional and spent almost 4 hours with us showing us his beautiful designs and completed projects from his previous clients. We decided to hire him and we are so happy that we did. David came up with an amazing 3D concept design (that looked much real then the actual spaces) for each space that we wanted to remodel. He managed the remodeling project from start to finish and with the final decoration of the home. Our house looks amazing and our kitchen is, now, huge and has an island to die for. Our master bathroom is like a high-end spa at a five-star hotel. We are really thankful to the team from SOD Home Group for making our home an amazing place for our family."
5,"SOD group was great to work with. We did our master bathroom remodel, full house carpet, and some special electrical work with them and it was a great experience from start to finish. They were on time and followed through with every promise. Doing the project during Covid added extra challenges and they were extremely, safe, responsible and respectful of our space. Their contractors were all excellent and also very respectful. We highly recommend them. Ben, Eden, and Micah were a fantastic team."
5,"Thank You Oren and the Team at SOD Home Group! We just completed our bathroom remodeling & we really love it each and every day! After our research that included several other companies, we decided to hire SOD Home Group. Oren told us all about the entire service that they provides, their past expertise in working with home projects, getting all the permits, design, materials and fixtures, electrical, through to the actual work and the final step of clean up. They seriously were able to handled it all! Oren was our main person that we worked with and he gave us a beautiful, modern bathroom design plans which was what we envisioned. Oren was really great person! He was there with us every step of the way. He answered all our questions (we really had many lol) because this was our first remodeling ever. The SOD Home Group team really took care of everything! We have already referred two couples who are looking to do complete remodeling of their houses."
5,"I highly recommend working with SOD Home Group. Our remodeling project included a complete kitchen remodeling, the removal of a wall, the removal and installation of new floors throughout the entire house, the replacement of the electrical rewiring, and several other upgrades to our old flip house. Oren and his team transformed the house into a stunning modern lovely place. Our old and ancient kitchen is now so beautiful, and we love using it and spend a lot of time cooking in it! we were continually impressed by the high quality of the work they did. The remodeling project was finished on time even though we had few numbers of difficulties along the work. All the workers came to work on time and were also very polite. Each time we asked any changes, touch-ups, or adjustments Oren returned to us right away to make sure we were pleased with the work. We also appreciate all the help they offered in making design options during the remodeling project. Overall, we had a wonderful experience working with Oren, and we will definitely hire SOD Home Group again for future projects!"
5,"We really IN LOVE with our kitchen. Oren and his team and office staff were artistic, clean, resourceful and respectful, and more than that – really true professionals. Oren met with us at our house and listened to what we wanted (and mainly needed) and offered many ideas/suggestions that we really appropriated. We now have a newly kitchen, very functional, warm, inviting and absolutely gorgeous kitchen that we wanted for a long time now! We had such a positive experience; I have recommended Oren and SOD Home Group to our friends."
5,"We interviewed and spoke to a lot of construction companies for our master bathroom and kitchen remodeling project and we ended up by hiring SOD Home Group.What a great and professional people of no less than sensational skilled people! We couldn’t be happier from the whole work that they did for us at our house. They were absolutely honest, fast phase, and very experience while they always kept guidance and advise us during the work which was fantastic, and huge plus. Oren, our project manager was wonderful! We are so happy with the final results of the work which was leading me to also have them redo my flooring.
Thanks a lot!"
5,"Oren and his crew from SOD renovated my house and they just complete the entire remodeling last week. The complete home remodeling that they did came out stunning and we are stunned by the way our house turned out. Oren managed and handled the whole remodeling project on a daily basis but…
a.He made sure that the project will be finished on time and within the budget
b.He made sure that each day the workers will have all they need in order to finish the daily and weekly tasks (and not before he personally inspected it)
c.He made sure that all the materials will be at the house at least 1 day before the workers will need them for the upcoming task.
We are so appreciative of the work that was done by the SOD teams and we are very comfortable to hire them again in the future for any additional remodeling that we may have."
5,"SOD Home Group is an excellent company, and we are confident that no other company in our country could have done a better remodeling job with our kitchen and first floor. Our remodeling project was supposed to be the kitchen space only, with a hardwood floor refinish and painting the walls. Working with Ezra, our project manager, and Oren, the designer, was very easy and productive. Ezra was extremely knowledgeable about the overall project and we are confident he did the best he could to provide us with accurate, and honest advices about the some issues when they came up. He earned our trust by consistently advocating on my behalf. He was very helpful and took pride in their work. Oren has a great eye for detail, a really heartening can-do attitude, and a hilarious amount of enthusiasm. She really knows design, and our house is significantly much more beautiful because we listened to him. SOD Home Group was great at communicating and has a good system for invoicing and change orders. They’re a steady, logic, and generally good construction company. We are confident any issues we had with them would have been issues with most other construction companies. Oren and Ezra definitely made an impression on my wife and I, and we would be happy to work with them in the future."
5,"We had a great experience working with SOD Home Group, our project manager Oren. The renovation was literally problem free (this is actually our second remodeling project so we knew that we will have some issues along the way but with this remodeling… all the problems were resolved fast and painlessly... we are very happy with how our remodeling project came out and we love using the beautiful and well-designed kitchen. We definitely recommend using SOD Home Group’s team and office staff because everything was made to fit our needs; it also went much faster than we thought it will be. We also loved that they were able to handle everything from A-Z including the cabinets, flooring, appliances and countertops and the price was reasonable for the quality of the products."
5,"For a while, we searched for a company that can remodel our kitchen and master bathroom. Our past experience with construction companies was ‘OK’ and we learned from our mistakes. SOD Home Group was recommended to us by some people who we know and they were very happy with Oren, his work and his team. From the idea to completion Oren was creative, skilled and professional person to have. Our challenge was that we were at home during the remodeling and we were very impressed by the preparation work that they did before the demolition started! The communication, care and dedication from the team was amazing. We were not used to this style of support from them! The result of the remodeling is what we really dreamed about, plus!"
5,"Oren, from SOD Home Group, remodeled our kitchen and all the upstairs bathrooms. He did an amazing job which included all the design elements that we really wanted, and he also came up with many great solutions to our initial wishes, all with wonderful style. The new kitchen is stunning and very practical. Now that we finish the work with them, we can say that Oren and his team are very trustful people and they can make anyone remodeling dreams come to life. Thanks, Oren for your amazing remodeling job!"
5,"From the planning stage, to the completion of all the permits from The building & safety department the remodeling project of our house… the work that was made by our contractor Oren (from SOD Home Group) was much more than just ‘excellent’. The results of all the spaces at our house (Kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms etc..) ended with a classy, very efficient, super comfortable 3 bedrooms 2.5 baths house with stunning rooms and beautiful features. Oren is a truly master contractor and his way of work made us fall in love with him."
5,"SOD Builders Group finished the conversion of our garage into a guest room that included a small kitchen, bathroom and living space. The remodeling project took 2.5 months and it was based on a daily basis work under the supervision of Oren and Odelia (from the office). Each stage started only after Oren personally visited our house and confirmed that the previous stage was complete. This way of work made our remodeling so easy, stress-less and easy. Shril on the other hands.... made sure that all the orders, delivers and invoicing will be no less than perfect and she made sure that everything will be ready for the teams at least 1 day before they will move to the next stage. 
Each week we had several conversations with Oren regarding the progress and we were in the loop at any time during the work.
we are very happy with SOD Builders Group and we will hire them again in the future."
5,"We want to thank SOD Home Group for all the hard work that they did at our house AND while we were out of the house while the work took place. Issac met with us several times before the work started and he handled the project like it was his house... he made sure that the teams will arrive to work each day and that the daily and weekly tasks will be completed while he inspects them personally. More than that he always informed us with all the details, pictures and videos about the work progress. We highly recommend SOD Home Group for any home remodeling project!!!!"
5,"We used SOD builders to completely remodel an old house. It ended up being a big project, and SOD/Oren was great to work with. They are very dedicated to making the customer happy. And while there was some delays and heartaches along the way (understandably for such a big project ), we are very happy with end result. What is more, they even came back a year later to fix some minor issues that had cropped up. That is amazing customer care. Thanks to Oren and Team."
5,"It's always a pleasure to work with SOD Builders. Oren's knowledge in the field is very impressive and he brings such an added value to each project. The SOD Builders team is a group of professionals, easy to communicate with and their attention to detail is impeccable. Oren's work ethics are rare to find nowadays; honesty, integrity, and quality. If he promises something, he will deliver on it. To say that I have been impressed with the level of service they provide their clients with will be an understatement. Our projects together always turned out to be a huge success with referrals from those clients. Therefore, I highly recommend SOD builders to homeowners who are looking to remodel their homes with peace of mind."
5,"We really love the new bathroom that was remodeled by Oren and his workers. We worked with Oren from start to finish and by doing that, we had no hassle or many people to talk to about anything related to the project at our house. The old bathroom was too old and we wanted to have a new look by replacing and installing everything including the new shower and floor. From the moment we signed and paid the initial payment, Oren made sure to take care of everything and only informed us with the relevant information including, the arrival of any delivery or to go and select the materials. The new bathroom was completed after 3 weeks of work and the last week of the work was to fix and correct the minor issues that we had."
5,"Our recent experience with SOD Builders was a long distance remodeling project relationship thing. We hired them for our project before we moved into the home (because we are out of state). As part of their work, they installed new floor around the entire house, totally remodeled the guest bathroom including some major upgrades to the master bathroom. Due to our situation, many of the design details were discussed and agreed over the phone and by emails while most of the remodeling work was even done without us visiting the house and seeing the progress. Oren definitely made this ‘almost’ stress and super difficult work entirely easy and nice. We had our total trust and confidence in them and the team that worked made us feel that we are in awesome hands during the process. The high quality work and the time frame that took them to finish the work…made us so pleased with the decision to hire them and we felt it right after we finally moved in. We recommend SOD Builders for their excellent services, high quality and also because they are truly a pleasure people and company to work with."
5,"SOD Builders was hired to remodel our house that we just purchased los Angeles area. We are very confident to recommend them because many different reasons but for the sake of this review… we’ll just mention some of them. 
- They were very dedicated to provide us with the required results of the work.
-They were multipurpose and flexible during the work even if it was a small modification that we wanted to do.
- They were open and honest with us about how long specific stages of the project will take.
- They were professional when it came to the designs and layout of the remodeling. Our project manager (Oren), the designer and the office were very involved in our project making for a unified project.
With the points above… our project turned out to be a stress free construction project. The remodeling was the main thing that turned our house into a new property. We are so happy with the new our and we can’t wait to hire them again in the future for a pool remodeling project. We are fully satisfied with  the beautiful work executed by SOD Builders!"
5,"We had a townhouse remodeled and it included all the upper and lower cabinets in the kitchen, master bathroom redesign and remodeled & guest bathroom downstairs with new marble counter tops,  faucets, double sinks, wall mirrors & recessed lights on top of new layer of paint and electrical work.  The whole remodeling project final costs was much less than we originally budgeted and it was finished much faster than we planned. Our biggest concern was that we couldn’t be there physically to oversee the daily work because we live in another city and we relied on the experience, honesty and professionalism of Oren, his team of people.  They both kept us up to date on the progress of the work & each day they sent us pictures of the work that was performed each day. We are happy with the ideas that they came up with during the work and we would highly recommend them.  Many thanks to the whole SOD Builders crew for an excellent remodeling job."
5,"SOD Builders gets my high score for being so skilled, honest and professional during the entire pool construction that we recently had at our house. We always talked about getting a nice pool, but we needed to have specific requirements before starting the work. The SOD Builders team made sure to stand behind certain standards prior taking on this pool project and this made us feel so comfortable and secure that we decided to hire them and moving forward. Within few months, Oren and the team had the pool construction complete and now it is really a proud project to see and use. We couldn’t asked for a better construction company than SOD Builders to design and build our dream pool. We highly recommend SOD Builders for anyone who is looking to bring a remodeling project to life."
5,"When I decided to go with SOD Builders, Oren and his team including the office staff did a great work by remodeling our kitchen (I must mention that this was not an easy remodeling project because of space issues). The kitchen space turned out to something that is gorgeous and super functional. On top of that, Oren helped me with the selection of all the materials.  me and my family really love the overall service at SOD Builders. they always were there for me, always answered to all my questions even when I had a problem during the work, Oren sent someone at night to fix the problem. I must mention that all of my questions/concerns were always answered in a timely and professional manner. I highly recommend SOD Builders for any kitchen remodeling project."
5,"We convert the garage into a guestroom that is 550 sq/ft in size. We hired Oren and his company at SOD Builders to do that after he was able to give us a great price on the materials and the labor. Oren was able to include all the items that we wanted to have in the space and this included a small closet, kitchen and bathroom. What we loved was the fact that Oren designed, estimated and executed everything including the paint colors and textures of the floor and he was able to bring us several samples with combinations of what we should do. The bedroom was remodeling was completed after 3 months and the end results are awesome."
5,"Oren at SOD Builders did a perfect work with the 4 bathrooms project at our house. Oren was professional and very polite to us and he had a lot of patience towards his workers and the vendors that worked as well. The bathrooms that we remodeled (Master bathroom, 1 guest bathroom and 1 jack and jill) included a long vanity with 2 sinks and faucets, New stone floor with nice design, Paint and all the hardware that installed on the doors, walls etc... The bathrooms that we have included a shower and bath tub. All of them have been included in the remodeling and we love the new look."
5,"We had such a wonderful experience with SOD Builders all the way from the design during the actual work  installation and final check list of our remodeling project with the team. Oren on the supervision side of the work were wonderful people when it came to ideas, planning and execution. The workers were superb and perfect problem-solvers. After the work was completed, Oren stayed in touch with us in order to be sure that we were very satisfied and happy with the complete work (kitchen, 2 bathrooms and the entry of the house). Highly recommend!"
5,"Oren at SOD builders came over to our house (we got his contact information from a coworker who just hired them for a large-scale remodeling project). he measured the kitchen and bathroom and took some pictures in order to generate a great design for the spaces. His design looks very nice and we hired him for this work. He brought also one of his workers to take a look and see if he would like to change or modify anything. 
the work was divided to sections:
1. demolition of the existing one
2. move some lights and outlets
3. patch and fix the walls
4. paint the kitchen 
5. install the cabinets
6. install all the lighting fixtures
7.install the counter tops, sink and faucet
8. install the appliances 
9. do some touch ups of the paint.
during the work, we had no issue with any of the employees. 
they did their work and made sure to move everything before work."
5,"We used SOD Builders for a remodeling project recently and I cannot recommend them highly enough. They did awesome work at all stages of the remodeling project, from drafting to design to the actual work. On top of that, they were very friendly and nice people to work with. My remodeling project included: New kitchen, new hardwood flooring and paint of the entire house, in addition to some minor bathroom updates. From the beginning, the design team made me feel at ease with their wonderful suggestions and attention to all the detail. Working with them really felt as a collaborative effort. They very open to my ideas, implementing the good ones and explaining the differences. In addition to designing the cabinetד, they helped me select all the appliances, flooring, paint. The team was top-notch. They were friendly, skilled, hardworking and excellent craftspeople. The whole remodeling project was completed within our budget and just a little bit over time… but that’s because we added more things during the work. Were thrilled with how things turned out!"
5,"We had the pleasure working with SOD Builders and the team. Our remodeling ended up much better than what we wanted. The remodeling involved tear down a wall, brand new kitchen, 2 bedrooms, the back entry of the house and also the front entrance. The office staff, the designer and the working people were very personable and easy people. We had the vision for the front entry and Oren with his team were able to build a mock up so we could feel how the final look will turn out. They always arrived to work on time, worked with the budget and provided wonderful recommendations when issues and problems came up. We will hire them again for all of our future remodeling projects."
5,"It was a pleasure to hire SOD Builders our big remodeling project at our main living house! We had no problems, issues, delays, of missing days during the work with any of the workers, supervisor (Oren) that worked at our house NOR with any of the office staff. The remodeling project that included the kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms and garage AND the outdoor kitchen came out nice and perfect and within 4 months from the day we hired them and the day the work got started! We are very happy, lucky and fortunate to have SOD builders at our house."
5,"We were happy with the estimate that we got from Oren about our guest bathroom, Kitchen, Garage and few other items at our house. Oren was nice to us during the remodeling and he communicated with us on each step of the remodeling. His workers and his supervisor came every day to work and they were nice people as well. Over all, The new bathroom looks good and nice and we are pleased with the quality of the work that SOD Builders did."
5,"I have hired SOD Builders on major repair and renovation project for my damaged house that got damaged after a fire damage. The customer service and attention that I got from this company and mainly from the actual people that worked at my house was outstanding and I would highly recommend them with my eyes closed to anyone that need to any remodel any house that have this type of damage. Here is with my own words of why and what they did at my house that caused me to write this review and recommendation about them: 
a.Honest & ethical: From the first time I called them till the moment the final payment was done, I noticed that all they care was to make sure to do the work on the best side and not to try and find reasons to earn more and more money. During the work itself, there were additional problems that were found and most of them were taken care of without even letting me know or to try and charge me for additional money.
b.Budget – The work was divided to 2 sections... section 1 was for the first time they arrived to my house and tried to save as much as possible things. And the second time was for the complete work that needed to be done in order to make the house as a living house. In both things, the amount that was set, was fixed and didn’t changed and more than that. On the second stage, the budget that was set didn’t raised or included any hidden charges.
c.On-time: They give realistic timeframes and realistic quotes. They may not the cheapest or fastest, but you can be sure and confident that they're costs will be reasonable and that they will complete the job without any hesitation or concern when they promise and within budget.
d.Great working skills and extremely ethical working people: The people at SOD Builders were able to provide me with excellent ideas about the new repairs. Because of the damages, I have the opportunity to redesign the kitchen mainly and the first floor of the house.
e.Great people! The company assigned to my house several people that did the actual work and they were managed and supervised by Oren. Oren was the most serious person that we dealt from the company and all he cared was to make sure that the work is being done on the most perfect side and without any problem. The rest of the people were excellent people."
5,"We were satisfied with our previous contractor who remodeled our master bathroom but this time he wasn’t available to do it due to some family reasons and we wanted to remodel the rest of the bathrooms including the kitchen so we started to make our research and to find a good contractor. Our neighbor hired SOD Builders recently and he showed us his remodeled bathroom and it was amazing so we asked for the phone number of SOD Builders. We called them and spoke to Christin who was very nice to us, she was able to schedule the meeting with Oren and to start the work within a week and a half after. The price was fair and we hired them. The remodeling project took 8 weeks, which was within a promised time frame. They did a very good job, and the quality of all the finished products were at highest level and it looks beautiful. We truly can’t ask for more. Very Professional contractor, We will recommend and hire their service again – for sure!"
5,"In one word,  WOW!
Oren Dagan and SOD Builders has far exceeded our expectations with their outstanding customer service, design team, and quality of work. They have been so wonderful to work within our home remodeling in Westlake Village. Their team has been prompt, patient, and professional in dealing with my wife and me in our crazy time. They have team, great eye for the most up to date trends and trades yet have been very practical in dealing with our budget and the fact we have four young children under the age of ten. The whole staff from top to field to the office has been great, and I would recommend them to anyone looking for the (one word) WOW experience."

They carefully worked alongside our family in the decision-making process resulting in an experience that exceeded our high expectations in the quality of craft and overall design, but they also came on a budget! 
 
They worked tirelessly to place neat and clean, hang pictures, accessorize beyond belief.
Their concierge team kept surprised us, make us feel special and unique, and at the same time, they made sure we are safe and on our side. The experience was beyond belief and could not have been more seamless as every consideration of detail was checked and rechecked.

Our family is forever grateful for all their help and will not hesitate to use them again in the future. Thank you, family!"

We really appreciate all the attention that was invested in all the details, the professionalism and the passion to accommodate our needs. We were treated with lots of respect and compassion as they always answered to each and every question we had AND they made lots of efforts to pleased us.

2,"The company cancelled a scheduled appointment the day of without a call or email explanation, simply a calendar cancellation.  I was working from home in order to make the appointment. It wasn’t until I called that I was told their schedule was booked and that I’d need to reschedule. In the future a more considerate approach would be to call and explain the last minute cancellation then request for a reschedule."
5,"Luxcess Home by SOD Builders is such a great construction company with outstanding customer service and very high-end standards. All of their workers are very professional, skilled and well-mannered while Oren always was there for us to answer all of our questions, comments, concerns and ideas. After we finished our remodeling, we can say clearly that we definitely won’t hire anyone else ever for any remodeling that we may do in the future while we will keep recommend them to our friends, family and who ever we know. Bottom line is that they were the greatest team that we can ever imagine to work or be involved with."

Oren took care of everything that related to the remodeling, from the planning stages all the way to the execution of it. He placed a lot of attention to each and every step while focusing on the budget and schedule. We were amazed when we arrived home each night to see the progress and how they left the remodeling space clean. His team of people cleaned every day before they left the house.

Before we started the conversion of our 2 car garage, we researched and shopped around for few months until we went ahead with Luxcess Home by SOD Builders. Because we are a picky people, we went physically to see several remodeling jobs that they did recently. We were impressed but also worried at the same time. Based on what we saw, we felt that our estimate will not fit our budget and that we will not be able to afford it. The sales rep delivered us the quote and spent 5 hours with us. He didn’t push us to sign the contract and more than that, he didn’t try to persuade us. We took all the information he gave us and few days after, we called him and agreed to talk over the weekend. Shortly after that day, we called him and scheduled the meeting at our house. The price for the work was fair and we felt that we are in good hands. We signed the agreement and a week after, the project started. We converted the garage (about 500 sq/ft) to an amazing single room including a bathroom & steam shower, small laundry area and a kitchen. Everything came out perfect. The additional unit blend well with the rest of the house and all of our friends including our family members that visited us after the work was completed, could not believe how nice the new space… They were able to deal with all the challenges that the project included and how the new hardwood floor installation was blended to the house as a one long hardwood floor Hallway .We are very happy with the results"

The kitchen that we did included almost everything from New floor to paint and a nice island too. The workers worked on a daily basis and each day there was something that we could see as progress.  The materials were selected from a collection of samples that Adam brought to us when he designed the kitchen on his computer. The new design that he did was very professional and included all the items that we wanted to have in the new kitchen. We had no problems with the workers as well.

From day 1, Oren listening to our ideas, vision and his expert assistance to the overall remodeling. We highly recommend Luxcess Home by SOD Builders and we plan on hire them again for our house."
5,"The people at Luxcess Home by SOD Builders can do every type of remodeling project you’d expect from a construction company -- they are very skilled, professional and with many years of experience. They offer many quality trades of projects and they are extremely responsive. To our opinion, what separate them from all the other ones out there is their creativity and vision. Our house project required many structural repairs, but mainly the kitchen which is absolutely the center of the house, we wanted not only to be functional, but also to be no less than a beautiful space. Luxcess Home by SOD Builders did it! Gal was our designer and she walked us through all the possibilities based on our ideas and brought them to life. We love the new kitchen! It’s definitely gorgeous and functional. We know that anyone could live in this new kitchen! Gal walked us through all of the important details that come up during our home improvement project. We are looking forward to hire them again soon for our bathroom remodeling!"
5,"Luxcess Home by SOD Builders and mainly Gal, did a wonderful remodeling job to our kitchen and bathrooms. We did our big search in order to find the right home remodeling company for us & we know that we found the perfect one. Luxcess Home by SOD Builders were not the cheapest one from all the estimates we got… but we know from the past that cheapest doesn’t mean the greatest. Gal & his crew at Luxcess Home by SOD Builders were professionals, honest, hardworking people and mainly detailed. They know very good their stuff & each one of them was really expert in his field. We had no clue how to the remodeling should go but Gal’s experience & skills proved to us to be highly effective. They were always on time, arrived to work each day & made sure to clean up at the end of each day. We noticed clearly their strength in being very detailed in any step of the work because we are a perfectionists people ourselves & absolutely not easy people to please. We are happy and pleased with this company’s performance. We are looking forward to hiring them again in the future. Thanks Gal!"
5,"I contacted Luxcess Home by SOD Builders for a master bathroom renovation with a tight budget. Starting at the day when I called them, I told them what I wanted to do and if they can come over to check the bathroom and to give me an estimate. Yossi was the person that came over to my house and he checked and asked me some questions in which showed me how skilled he is and when he presented me the quote… I was surprised that it fit by budget without even asking for discounts. Yossi was very understanding and he was able to send his crew to start working 2 days after due to the fact that they had another job completed just few blocks away from my house! The crew worked very carefully and Yossi made sure that the budget will stay as is and without any changes. I was amazed to see how the progress get along each and every day. More than all the above, I was very amazed that they finished the entire project earlier than Yossi initially quoted me. I am so thankful that I hired them for my bathroom remodeling project!"
5,"Ehud, was a real pleasure person to work with. We hired Ehud at Luxcess Home by SOD Builders to design and create an entire new outdoor living space including a pool. Ehud did a work that completely surpassed all of our dreams! He was very creative, wonderful vision, hardworking person and with great attention to details, which was very important (specifically for this size of a project)!! Ehud was at the house each and every step of the way, from the design stage all the way to the end of the project. He was well planned, expert, easygoing and very accommodating to all of our needs. If there was any issue or if we changed our mind on anything, he was right on it. We were very fascinated with his team as well. They were very respectful, careful and reliable and went out of their way to make us happy and satisfied. We highly recommend Ehud and Luxcess Home by SOD Builders. We very much in love with our new outdoor space flows. Thank you Ehud, we miss seeing you!"
5,"From our initial meeting with Oren & Adam from Luxcess Home by SOD Builders… we knew that we were dealing with a experienced, qualified and skilled team of people who could bring our dream pool into a reality. Everyone who was involved at our project really listened to our ideas and vision while their new design of how the new pool will look like was much more improved compare to our original concept. Oren is a wonderful project manager who managed an expert team and kept us completely informed in regards to the progress of the work and made all the adjustments hassle-free. Our new pool was completed within our budget and a little bit before the promised time and we truly enjoyed contributing in the makeover of our back yard. It was a real pleasure to have Oren, Adam and the team provide us with excellent service and a wonderful pool!"
5,"Overall the project went very well. We chose SOD Builders because their price was competitive, but more importantly their timeframe was quick. Our priority was the completion date because my wife is pregnant, and we needed the house to be move in ready before the baby arrived. The beginning design phase took longer than expected and made us nervous if the estimated completion date would be met. However once the project started and we were assigned our Project Manager Udi, everything moved quickly. Udi kicked ass. He was on top of scheduling crews at the house every day, inspections, and correcting minor changes my wife and I wanted. All said and done our house was completed on time. The project included full kitchen remodel, bath remodel, electrical, plumbing, hardwood/tile flooring, fireplace refacing, and paint throughout. From the beginning of demo to completion was 2 months which is an impressive turn around time for a full interior remodel. We pretty much have a new house to start a new family and we are very happy"
5,"The entire project that included so many item at my house was designed and managed by Gal of SOD builders, with a design that was created by input from me and installed by his several professional teams. The project contained the full remodeling of the kitchen, dining room and living room. All new cabinets (from diamond cabinets) were installed, red hardwood floors, custom cut marble counter tops, back splash, new appliances, under counter sink and all the rest of the items that required for this remodeling project. The entire remodeling work took about 7 weeks from beginning to end and I was able to live in the house during the whole work. The construction teams were so professional and reliable and made sure to do everything according to the plan while Gal managing and monitoring the daily and weekly tasks and making sure that they are coming out in perfect condition. They also made always sure to clean at the end of each day. At the end of the project, I must say that the project had a fabulous outcome and is certainly a top quality. I don't feel I could have had a better outcome from any other contractor. It was just great!!!!!"
5,They were on time and set us up exactly as we requested. We have been planning to expand our back yard and living space and now our new fire pit area makes everything flow completely into each other. We just love our new back yard!
5,"SOD builders is an excellence home remodeling company that for sure will works very hard for their clients! We have met with Adam on our large scale remodeling project at our new house that we recently purchased. In the past, we hired him on some remodeling projects and we were very happy with his work while this time is no difference and he was able to bring to life our vision and design. He was very committed to our project and we noticed how much he cares for everything. His work with his crew was very tight and it worked like a charm. No problem or issue was left alone during the work and each part of the work was ended only after he physically checked it and approved it. Our large scale remodeling was to remodel the kitchen, bedrooms and bathrooms. The kitchen needed to be redesigned and Adam came up with some great ideas that left the house in an open space design that each section of it was separate from the other one while in the meantime, there was no large walls that showed the separation. The work was completed after 2 months of a day by day work and each day, we had at least 6 people working together at the house, each one on a different section. We are very happy with the complete results of the work and we want to thank them all here in this review. Thank you Adam and everyone who was involved in our house remodeling."
5,"Allen at SOD builders done wonders at my home. I needed several projects to be done and I just could not decide where to start. I wanted to upgrade the kitchen and bathrooms and to upgrade the living room area. So I asked around all my friends & family for any referral and one of my friends, referred Allen to me. Because it was a big remodeling that involved a lot of money, I searched and checked about him and his company before hiring him and paid my hard-earned money. On my first meeting with Allen, I was the one that did most of the talking and he just listened and took his notes about my taste, goals and more... Allen helped me to prioritize what to start first which was a huge help to organize my thoughts and to understand that it is better to start with something but to do it on the best side. So after that meeting, I decided to remodel the living room, bathroom and kitchen area. Allen planned and helped me with all the stages of this work and he even went with me personally to select materials. The only minus thing that happened was that the finishing date did not end on the scheduled date (which is ok and normal for this size of remodeling). The quality of work, craftsmanship and perfection in the design & completion, on top of the service that I got was remarkable. I always got answers to my questions and comments. All the involved workers and sub-contractors came on time each day and never caused any problem. Allen had always found the time to pass by and check their work and progress. There were some problems during the work, but Allen and all the workers were there to address it right away and solve it. I know I could not achieve that results of my work with any other Company. So thank you Allen for the wonderful job & until the next remodeling."
5,"Oren and his skilled team of professionals made our dream remodeling of kitchen, living room and laundry room. From our first appointment with Oren, continued to the demolition stage all the way to the completion of the work, the whole team and involved people of SOD builders were expert, honest, highly motivated people and well organized. Any issue that was raised along the way… was addressed correctly and handled in a professional manner and we were always informed of the progress, deliveries and installations of our project. We must state that our remodeling project was also priced right and our price didn’t change during the remodeling. This was something very important for us and we are happy that it stayed that way. We felt like we were in great hands and we will definitely call on them again for any future projects."
5,"I have not had the pleasure of hiring Ehud at SOD builders for upgrading my landscape plantings, build a new fire pit with seating area, replace all the existing backyard floor with new stamp concrete one, Adding an awning system that will be useful during summer time and mainly to add a nice BBQ spot. I was very happy with SOD builders and I was a somehow concerned how this whole work will come out. After the first few days of the actual work, I knew that the work will be done on the best side and Ehud will deliver exactly what I wanted. My backyard is now done and it has never looked so beautiful than it is right now. Ehud did a wonderful job and his planning and understanding what I want was fully worth it! More than that, Ehud spent almost a week with us to find the right materials for this work and this part was the worst part BUT at the end… I appreciated all the time and affords that he put into this part of the work. Ehud was really on top of everything and he did so much just to see how I’m pleased and happy with the work and progress. All the people that did the actual work were easygoing, resourceful, and skilled and were willing to spend the extra time by making sure that perfection will be the right definition for the work they do and they always found the time to talk with me about issues or problems that happened. The cost for this awesome project was very reasonable. I do recommend anyone to hire and use SOD builders."
5,"During the years and each time we moved to a new house, we have hired many contractors and we did had satisfied results with most of them, so we knew what to look for when we need to hire a good contractor when we need one. SOD builders was one of the contractors that we hired in the past and we were very happy with them and they were top notch with excellent results. As soon as we hired them this time, the remodeling project passed all of our expectations. We hired them to remodel our backyard and kitchen including the replacement and installation of 5 windows that 1 of them required them to expand the wall in order to create a new balcony sliding door. Before the work started, Allen and the office staff ordered all the materials and they started the work like a week before they all arrived to the house. The first thing that started the work was the demolition of the existing spaces, framing, plumbing, electrical, new cabinets (upper and lower), lighting fixtures, stamp concrete on the back yard part, tile, drywall, new paint and the installation of all the appliances. They worked fast, professionally, and flawlessly. Every day we noticed a change in the progress and the workers came on time and they stayed until they finished the daily tasks. We never had any complaint or problem with anyone that was involved at the remodeling project. The new kitchen was completed on time, within the budget and in a professional manner. We love the new kitchen and the stamp concrete in the back yard!"
5,"When we hired SOD builders to remodel the kitchen at our house, we were told by the people who referred us to them that they would stay on schedule and for sure on budget. Since we had 1 bad experience with our previous contractor, we were hesitating to believe it. Adam and his sub-contractors were without any doubt the most skilled, honest, trusty and reliable people we have ever met. They were polite and respectful to the fact that we were living in the house during the work and they made sure we were ok with everything. The remodeling spaces were neatly cleaned at the end of every day and left as little dust as possible in the rest of the house. Everything they did, was approved by us prior (on a daily basis) to be sure we were all on the same page. All and any issue that came up during the work, were addressed right away in a professional way. Adam and his contractors are truly the best in terms of workmanship, reliability and honesty."
5,"We had our bathrooms remodeled by SOD builders just recently! Our master bathroom was the most major turnaround from all the other bathrooms that we did. Our supervisor Adam among his team of people with his sub-contractors, were professional and productive. Adam worked hand by hand with us to reach an amazing results. His ideas and participation along with our spoken requirements ended in a really overwhelming results. Adam was able to generate for us a before & after designs so we can fell the transformation of how it will be after the work is complete. The work was performed while we were living at the house and their work was not interfering our day to day things. They worked clean and they made sure to protect all the spaces to prevent any type of damages. The work was done in a continuous manner with Adam regularly checking all phases of the job as it advanced! Punctuality was a main feature with him! We would have no doubts in referring him to anyone looking for an honest and reliable contractor!"
5,"From the first consultation meeting that we had with Adam all the way to the final walk thru of the remodeling project that was done by him and his crew, Adam was a great person to work with. The work that he did for us (A complete kitchen remodeling, bathrooms remodeling, laundry room upgrade and the 2 car garage) was done in fairly time and with high standards of quality. Every one of the crew members made sure that their part in the work was done to the high standards of the rest of craftsmanship that was defined and managed by Adam. During the remodeling project, we were provided with all the relevant information including solutions to raised problems that came up and all of our questions were answered in a professionally manner. Now that our project is complete and after working with Adam at SOD builders, we are sure that our house will serve our needs for many more years to come."
5,"SOD builders just finished a major kitchen remodeling project for us. Adam removed all the old floor and replaced it with new ¾ hardwood floor. On top of that, he refaced all the kitchen cabinets, took down a wall including some cabinets that were between the kitchen and living room and added a new overhead beam. The old countertop was also removed and a new marble countertop have been installed and polished. The dishwasher was relocated and replaced with a new stainless steel one. In the electric part of the remodeling we relocate several electrical switches and outlets and installed an overhead exhaust fan. We are very pleased and satisfied with all the work that Adam and his people did for us. Adam is careful, easy person to talk to and he did his best to keep the functionality of the kitchen for us as much as he could during the remodel. Everyone appeared at the house on time and mainly were focused only on the project. The kitchen was completed on time, but only due to the fact that they also worked extra time on Sundays too just to stay on time! More than that, during the remodeling, we came across few problems with the plumbing and electricity, but Adam was on top of it with the electrician and plumber so those issues were solved at no time. Adam’s schedule is pretty full but now we know how worth is the wait. We will not think twice to hire them again. We are very proud to write this review!"
5,"We are very proud and happy to write this great review for Oren and the whole team at SOD builders! We decided to select SOD builders out of 6 other home improvement companies that we met and talked to in regards to our home remodeling project. We much mention here that the other 2 companies were too rough and pushy people that all they wanted is to just make the sale and to have us signed on the contact which was the reason why we ended up not hiring them. This type of work was a big no for us and never want to deal with this type of people or companies. Oren was the exact opposite from that and his approach was first to understand what we want and what is our vision in regards to the kitchen and bathrooms that we wanted to have. After he understood that, he provided us with his ideas that were in fact nothing less than improvements on that and this was enough for him to come up with a 3D design that reflected the entire concept. Our kitchen and bathrooms came out much better than the definition of ‘Stunning’ and this is exactly what we wanted to get from anyone that we hired for our house. All the workers came to our house each day and on time while focusing on perfection and daily tasks, stayed on the agreed budget and schedule! We WILL hire them again for sure in the future for any home improvement project that we may have. High recommendations and perfect references! Great office staff and supervision!"
5,"Based on my recent experience with Adam with my kitchen remodeling, I can only write that I will recommend SOD builders to everyone I know. Prior for me hiring them, I got 3 other estimates and Adam was definitely my guy from the moment we ended our second meeting about the project. Adam was quick, qualified and easygoing. Before I wanted to go ahead with my remodeling, I knew more or less what I want to do and how I would like it to be done. Adam was very communicative and patient during the meetings and he heard everything I wanted to do and need even though it wasn’t an easy task. My kitchen space is medium size and had a lot of potential. Adam was able to implement most of my things and mostly to fit it within my budget. During my remodeling, I wanted to do some things that were out of his comfort zone. Adam connected me with his vendor who was able to do them as well and I was very happy for that as well. If I could write any word for my experience with SOD builders and mainly Adam, it would be ""WONDERFUL""!"
5,"I hired SOD builders for designing and do all the construction work for the front and backyard of my new house. Avi and his team were professional, more than responsible and they put a lot of attention to details and perfection during the whole work. Avi was extremely communicative and reactive, he always answered all the questions I had and he worked with me hand by hand to design, plan and deliver all of the things that I wanted to have for my landscaping project. His team was regularly at the home from start to finish. And the entire team at SOD builders made no hesitation to make sure that I was happy and pleased with the work they did. The company kept stuck to my budget and any change that could increase that number, was conditioned to my approval. Avi showed me all the available options that I can have prior of me making any choices from hardscape to plant selection and placement of features. This is a really devotion and this company have honesty and they do look and care to make sure that customers comes first and primary before making the money.  The whole team were creative in a way that they passionately shaped the backyard from an empty lot and converted it into a gorgeous outdoor living space that perfectly work for my family and friends. I would recommend them for sure over and over again and I will hire them again when we need any additional work done!"
5,"We are very happy with our kitchen remodel that was remodeled by SOD builders and supervised by Allen! During the remodeling, we honestly enjoyed working hand by hand with Allen. Part of our meetings prior to hire them, Allen came over with a stunning design designed of the new kitchen and the design was very impressive and exactly as the real kitchen which we are so proud of. The entire crew of workers were involved in the remodeling of the kitchen and the breakfast area and they were great people to work with during the whole time. Allen guided us each step of the way with his knowledge and ability. We can't write here all the compliments we get about the kitchen from all the people that come over and how their face look when they open the doors and see it for the first time! We truly enjoy spending time in the kitchen and the breakfast area now. Thank You, Allen and crew!!!"
5,"We recently hired (Adam) SOD builders to do a complete kitchen renovation at our house which includes painting, replacing the existing floor with new marble floors (24”x24”) and to upgrade the electrical wires and adding outlets and switches. Adam was the project supervisor and he did an excellent job with his professional crew, supervision the project, managing the work schedule and handling the sub-contractors. As part of his work, he sent us a daily report/update. We both work full days during the week and we were thankful that we could lean on Adam for this remodeling project. He also quickly understood our vision and the style we wanted while he did the hard work by searching and finding all the accessories for this job (lighting, marble tiles, faucets, cabinet pulls, and more...) so they all will match and fit. During the work, he was cautious to our budget and helped us solving several scenarios of problems in order to make them fit into the budget. We know that the highlight of our work with Adam was when he found and designed the tile backsplash which came out stunning, and he found a way to make this tile work within our budget. We hope to do work with him in the future on our patio project!"
5,"We worked with Gal from SOD builders to remodeling our master bathroom. We were looking for someone that can guide and help us with good ideas and options and mainly to listen to what we want or need. Gal was able to deliver all of that and even more! At first, He met with us and listened to what we wanted to do and he gave us some great suggestions that at the end he was able to implement them throughout the entire remodeling. Gal communicated with us in an excellent way and he was easygoing even though we made some changes or we couldn’t make a decision. We are very happy with our new master bathroom and Dan was the one that helped and guidance us. During the remodeling, Gal with his team came to work every day and on time, kept us informed and were patient with us. They worked on the master bathroom as if they were working on their own houses. It was a great practice and we will work with Gal again including recommend them to anyone we know. We are very happy with the end result and the process of getting there."
5,"We hired Allen from SOD builders to remodel our master bedroom and bathroom in addition to a small remodeling of a Jack and Jill bathroom. All people in the working crew were enjoyable people to work with. They were professional, skilled and came over to the house each day and on time. We am very precise about how things need to be accurate and neat OR in other words, it is hard to meet our expectations especially in the remodeling aspect. At the end of the work, our expectations were met. Our special requirements do cost and it’s hard to find someone that can actually do it right, but overall Allen was able to achieve it in a realistic price considering the value of actual work and materials. Our 2 bathrooms and the master bedroom are gorgeous and we enjoy showing them to our family and friends. We would not hesitate to use Allen or any of his workers in the future. Great work and thank you."
5,"We found SOD builders while they were working on a remodeling project in another house on the neighborhood. During that work, I approached the supervisor Allen and we asked him to see the work. After we saw what did do and how beautiful it is, we asked him to pass by our house and to see what we want to do and to give us a quote for the work. We wanted to remodel the kitchen and bathroom and also to paint the entire house. Allen came over and saw our house. He then went back to his office and did his homework including a 3D design. Dew days after, he called us and set an additional meeting with us to show us his ideas and prices. The remodeling project started a week after we agreed and signed all the documents and it took them less than a month to complete it. Allen did a wonderful work and he was able to implement most of the things we wanted. The kitchen came out beautiful and very functional while the bathroom got his new look and design. The final touch was the paint of the house which gave us a brand new look of the entire house. The whole remodeling was done in a very professionally manner. Allen put a lot of attention to all the details of the work. Thanks to Allen and entire crew that worked including the office staff for making our house look great!"
5,"We couldn’t be happier with the remodeling job that was made for us by SOD builders, under the supervision of Ehud. Ehud met with us several times before we hired him and he talked with us till he understood completely our goals and what we were trying to achieve with our remodeling. Ehud really listened and helped us finalize our project so it will fit with our opportunities and budget. This approach of Ehud gave us more trust in him and it was different from other contractors that we met because their approach was too rough for us and we didn’t like it at all. Ehud was also very familiar with the city codes and regulations, which saved a lot of time in drawing up the designs and money as well. Based on our meetings with Ehud, the office staff was able to come up with a wonderful 3D design which included most of our things and all we needed to do was to give it few touches till it was exactly what we wanted. The remodeling team and the sub-contractors were also professionals and polite while they gave a lot of attention to our schedule and preferences. In general, the whole team deserves this great review for the quality of the work they did for us. Our remodeling project was now a large one, but the time and affords SOD builders put into it, made us feel as very special clients."
5,"We recently hired Gal at SOD builders for a complete renovation of our kitchen, 2 bathrooms and master bedroom. Besides the fact that Gal not only finished the entire renovation on time and on budget, but the quality of it was more than wonderful and beat by far our hopes. Gal and the whole team including the sub-contractors were so skilled and available during the work and made it easy for us to stay living at the house while they were working. They were mainly careful with everything and they cleaned the working space daily and made sure it will be as safe as possible, not just at the end of the work. The most and important thing was that Gal answered each and every question or concern we had during the work and he always made sure that we were happy with each and any task of the work as they were installed. More than that, Gal and his crew were able to deal very professionally with any of the several surprises that came up during the work and they solved them always with minimizing our stress. We truly in love with all the remodeling that they did and with the fact that it was such an easy and stressful process that we are already considering how and what we will remodel in our next project."
5,"Oren from SOD builders was hired to create our dream house. We renovated two bathrooms, added an additional bathroom & laundry room and installed hardwood floors in all the bedrooms. We worked mainly with Oren. Oren was always reachable and reactive. He was creative and unbelievable from the design stage all the way to the actual construction. All of their workers and sub-contractors were generous, respectful, hardworking people with high reliability. Their cabinet maker person did beautiful work and was a pleasure to work with. During the work, there was a mold behind the old cabinets and our concern was that it will cause a major delay with the work. Oren made sure to take care of it with one of his vendors and they were tremendously helpful by solving that problem and keeping the project on track. The mold problem was an addition in price but Oren was able to get us the best deal with the mold remediation. Now that the remodeling is over, we can say that a lots of extra things were done for us and without any additional charge. A lot of them were just being done without even asking us. Oren was able to finalize the remodeling under budget and a little bit early than expected. Our house was treated as if it was their own. We are very pleased with the remodeling they did in the interior aspect of our house that we are currently in advance stage to work with them on the backyard and pool. We highly recommend selecting SOD builders for any project."
5,"We hired SOD builders to create an outdoor patio living space on our home. Oren and his workers were professional, organized, and very polite, offered a project plan, had an on-site project manager (Oren), and a team of well-seasoned, personable and talented sub-contractors who had worked together for years. They were trustworthy and communicated well throughout the entire project. There were never any surprises to the budget process and all was well-documented and shared throughout the progress of our project. We were able to work together as a team, sharing ideas, making any adjustments, and the results are a gorgeous outdoor space for my family to enjoy. We have great respect for Oren and Jacob. And, here is another example of how they stand behind their work -they just contacted us for a follow up even though the work has been completed few months ago. They wanted to have a walk through the addition to review any issues that may have arisen over the year since construction was completed so they could be fixed. I don’t know any contractor that offer such things to his clients. We will use SOD builders for all the other renovations we plan to do in our home. We know they will exceed our expectations on those too!"
5,"The house that we purchased is very nice and was not maintained for a while before we purchased it. The kitchen and the two bathrooms were too old and needed to have a complete renovation. Although we knew that beforehand (since the property was below value), we didn’t fully grasp the extent. Our main concern was that we had a limited budget for any of the repairs that we wanted to do. We were afraid that the repairs that we want to do will be too expensive and much more above the amount that we could afford. However, after investing a great amount of time in research, we realized the budget can be stretched right if we will find the right contractor. We have called a several contractors to come by and to give us a proposal for the remodeling of the kitchen and the 2 bathrooms. SOD builders was by far the best estimate for the remodeling.  It was a little over our budget, but we were happy to put up the extra money because we really liked the designs they gave us. Signing with Oren was very easy and after that was done, Oren was able to start the work immediately within few days. Oren, was on site nearly every day making sure everything is going well and according to the plan. The work crew came in each day and even when the weather turned bad and was extremely hot. We were surprised to find how neatly they made the remodeling site. Each day when they finish the work for the day they would clean up and prepare the space for the next working day. This made it really easy to walk around my house without bumping into things! They installed brand new marble counter tops in the kitchen, new cabinets and floor tiles. The bathrooms got a new coat of paint, double sided vanity and counter top. All of it fit comfortably with our budget. Everything looks new and even better than the rest of the house. Hopefully that will be remodeled soon too, and when it does I will definitely hire SOD builders again!"
5,"We hired SOD builders to perform a big remodeling of our home. The team and the sub-contractors that did the actual work, were professional, dependable and knew exactly what to do under the supervision of Oren and his foreman. The work went smoothly (at least as we know) and they were able to complete the work on time and without increasing the original budget (which to us it means a lot because it shows how professional this company is). Every job in that scale, has problems and issues that coming up during the work and as soon as walls are being taken down and to our opinion, the main key is to have a good company that can deals with them as they were minor issues or problems (and this can be achieved only by really professional ones). SOD builder’s staff and mainly Oren, were always there to respond and/or to provide a solution for anything that came across during the work. We are extremely happy with the final results of this project and we will recommend them to anyone who would like to do a new construction project or just to remodel any part of their house."
5,"After meeting in person and interviewing 4 construction companies and general contractors, we went ahead and hired SOD builders to do a major remodeling project at our house. We selected Oren because he had a great vision for design while implementing our ideas and wish list into the actual remodeling. Oren was also gave us a fair price for that work and we felt that we are in a good hands. Oren was able to provide us a detailed budget and mainly to give us a good schedule time for our remodeling work based on what we wanted to have. During our meetings with Oren, he was able to help us decide about some difficult design issues. Our project foreman, Michael was very pleasant person to deal with. Michael and Oren were very communicative with us and were able to answer all the questions we had during the work and even before we start and while they were working at the house, we got from them a weekly updates on the progress of the project and of each stage of it. All the concerns or problems that came up during the work, were quickly solved. During the work, Oren brought to the house several subcontractors (like electrician, plumber etc…). All of them were nice people and all they wanted was to do their part on the best side and under the quality rules of Oren. The work was finished a little bit over the schedule time that was assigned by Oren but most important, it was under the budget! The house turned out to be so beautiful and much more pleasant to be in! We will hire Oren and his crew again and we will definitely refer them to anyone planning a remodel."
5,"After questioning several construction companies to repair and renew our kitchen we were very impressed with SOD builders and are glad we hired them. Before retaining SOD builders, we questioned and appraised estimates that we received from other possible contractors. Most of them weren’t able to work around our ideas and visions for the kitchen design. There was something lacking in His presentation or they didn’t represent His companies or themselves as professionals who were willing to hear us. Most of the plans were designed on kitchen remodeling prototypes containing cabinets mounted in a straight line. They didn't grasp the concept of our kitchen and the end result we were trying to achieve. Oren Harel changed all that. He presented himself as professional, honest, dedicated to provide us with an excellence product. His work just proved to be very reliable by doing so. Oren was always willing to listen, take his time to really understand our ideas and to help us come up with the right plan for our dream kitchen. It was obvious that his professional history and experience gave him the ability to imagine our own ‘vision’. He had the ability to start with the end product in mind. The original contract was well prepared, well offered, fully clarified and easy to understand. His demonstrations were professional and each stage of the remodeling project was exactly as described. His performance to meet that end was evident in the working relationship that he had with his subcontractors. All the subcontractors that were working with SOD builders Construction in our remodeling, were outstanding, professional and open-minded for every step of the way. We easily came to trust on the SOD builders’ capabilities. Any question or concern that surfaced, Oren was able to take care of it immediately. If a change was required, we reviewed the amendment before signing the updated proposal. All these acts took place prior to starting any part of work. Oren was a huge asset to us. He was compassionate about our condition. He was always on time, showed up when he said he would. He called when he said he would. Oren was working hand by hand with all the subcontractors. And seriously involved with each day’s work and he always was on top of the daily construction needs or necessities. Oren was the kind of person who was welcomed into our home. He was forward-looking at all times. He was creative, trustworthy, very qualified and true to his word. Once we started working with him, we knew that we had hired the right company/person. He did everything he said he was going to do. He didn’t cut any corner. We would trust SOD builders with any project and without reservation, recommend the company to anyone."
5,"I was very pleased with the work and service that was provided by Oren. Oren and his team of workers remodeled my master bedroom by replacing the carper, installing a custom fireplace, paint the room, and remodel the master bathroom by replacing all the tiles, vanity, fixtures and plumbing. Oren is very attentive to details and perfection. He did a great job by supervising his people on a daily basis. His total price was very competitive compared to other contractors and mainly there was no hidden charges at the end of the remodeling and his quality of work was exactly what I expected to get for my money! I will recommend him to family and friends as I have been getting a lot of compliments for the work he did. Before Oren start to work at my house, he brought many samples of materials such as tiles and paint and lots of pictures which made the process flow and very easily. Also, his staff were very consistent by making sure that all my needs have been met. He will be my first choice when I will decide to remodel my kitchen as my next project. Thank you Oren and SOD builders!!"
5,"Our kitchen was a bit too small and uncomfortable because of a separating wall that was between the kitchen to the dining area, so we wanted to make it bigger and lighter and mostly to have the feeling of open space that will enlarge the space since we have the long windows and sliding doors by the dining area.  This remodeling was set in my mind for a while so I needed to put it in action.  I was just afraid it wouldn't be what I have in mind but SOD builders remodeled it the way I really wanted and expected to have. The moment Oren took down the separation wall at the kitchen, the space become so much bigger with so much light. I also wanted to replace the tile with wood floor and on the walls to have a nice tiles as back splash. Oren was able to get a great deal for all the materials and the big light creamy color ceramic tile on the floor with a really nice design with some stainless steel appliances and light grey pieces on the walls. Everything was going to look way too nice comparing to the cabinets so new dark brown wood cabinets were done too. I love my kitchen now and will use them in near future for sure."
5,"When we hired Oren from SOD builders, we liked that we dealt directly with the owners and no unprofessional salesman who work for commission and keep trying to push in order to sign the contract now and add as many items as he could knowing that we don’t know much about construction. After we met with Oren and his supervisor at our house, their attitude and their interest to know what we would like to have and how we imagine our new kitchen to look like etc.… we felt very comfortable and we scheduled the second meeting so we can see the design of the new kitchen and what Oren included in the new kitchen in regards to storage space and appliances. I must admit that this guys (Oren and his supervisor David) are definitely professional people and they have a great level of understanding and listening!!! The new design included all the features that we wanted to have and the total price was near the budget that we set at the first meeting. They total price for kitchen remodeling was about 10%- 18% less than all other 3 contractors that came to our house in order to do the same kitchen that we did with SOD builders. The job was done in a record time, so clean, so smooth exactly as promised."
5,"I fully recommend SOD builders! Oren and his team completed two remodels for our home in Tehachapi. The first remodel included two custom bathrooms in 2014. The bathrooms were designed by Michelle (The designer in SOD builders); Michelle works on many projects with Oren. Michelle highly recommended Oren for top-notch quality. We found Oren's team to be extremely knowledgeable, professional, and trust-worthy. Although the project took a bit longer than anticipated, it was well worth the wait, as the results are impeccable! We worked with Michelle and Oren again in for this remodeling on a much larger remodeling which included gutting and totally renovating the kitchen, living room, and dining room, as well as new flooring and interior doors throughout the remainder of the house. Shawn, Oren's cabinet maker, custom-designed the quarter-sawn Oak cabinets - amazing attention to detail! Shawn, as well as all of Oren's team, are excellent craftsmen. Oren, the supervisor of our remodel, suggested we vault the living room ceilings --this was not in the original plans, however, these ceilings transformed the room without adding square footage. 
Oren's work is top-notch; you get what you pay for. Do it right the first time. We really love our new home, and we would highly recommend SOD builders and his team!"
5,"I wanted to take the time and to express my experience and appreciation of the work that was done with SOD builders. Few months ago, we decided that it was finally the time to remodel all the bathrooms at the house (3 in total). We search and looked either online or by asking our friends and family in case they know a company that is worth to hire. After several recommendations and good search results, we came across SOD builders and we were impressed by their online site and past projects. From what we saw and heard, we decided to call them and to get more information about what we want to do and to hopefully schedule a face to face meeting and to take it from there. To our house arrived Oren and he checked and saw what we would like to achieve and to get from the bathrooms and what is the budget that we can afford. The first meeting was very good and few days later, we got the estimate for the work and Oren asked to meet with us again in order to go over it and see what can be changed. Oren understood exactly what we wanted and he made us feel like I was in very good hands. He was firm, capable and skilled. We really love my new bathrooms and we hope to work with SOD builders in the future."
1,"They took our $1,000 deposit and never worked on our deck or kitchen.  They were going to build our deck then remodel our kitchen for $80k.  It didn't happen.  They were to work on our deck prior to out kitchen.      It took over 1 month for them to respond to us at all after giving them our deposit check for $1k.    We kept waiting and waiting for a response, but we never received anything from Adam (our project manager).
Adam came to our house, he was a great sales person.  He convinced us that a SOD Builder is a fantastic company.  My wife had a great rapport with Adam during the initial interview/quote.  She mentioned I would travel to his home country (Hungry) for work.   He was excited and asked me questions where I went and how I liked it.  He seemed very personal and trust worthy, and I was sold.
I cut them a check for $1k on April 1,2016 for a deposit.  It was cashed on April 15th, 2016.  
Adam promised they would start immediately and he would personally be in charge of the project and be able to start the week of April 11th.  We were so exited getting a new deck and remolded kitchen.   They signed us up for Buildetrend.com.  This was a way for us to see the progress of our remodel.  I thought we were in the right hands.
We sent all the prints for the deck and permits to Adam.  The prints for the kitchen and permit were in progress.
We scheduled a time Monday April 11th, for the foeman to come get an assessment on the Demo of our deck., since Adam was the project manager, we thought Adam was going to be there too.  But to our surprise, only Damien (subcontractor) and another 2 workers were there. 
Damien asked for the drawings that we gave to Adam.  I was shocked, why didn’t Adam (Project Manager) give Damien (Sub Contractor) plans for our deck?  Our architect gave the official prints to Adam?  I don’t have a copy.  I ran scrambling thru emails looking for some type of schematic.  I finally found it after 20 mins of looking.  our Architect came by 10 mins after.  Our Architect was also expecting the Sub-Contractor to have the blue prints.  This was totally unprofessional.  There was no communication between Adam and the Sub-Contractor. 
After Damien left, we were told by SOD via Karla,  that Adam would “oversee” the project from the office.  He will never be on Site, only for emergencies.  The interview was the last time I talked to Adam or receive and email from our “Project Manager”.  This was not conveyed to us as the owners.  I wish he would have mentioned it during the quoting process.  We didn’t even get Damien’s email address.
Back to the story.  Now Damien has the plans, no work for the rest of the week. We try to contact Adam, to get pricing on the wood.  No contact from Adam from Tuesday Apriil 12- Friday April 15.  
Monday April 18th rolls around, no work has been done on the Deck, no contact from Adam for pricing.    We try to contact Adam or anyone from SOD, but nothing.  No Contact from Adam from Monday April 18th – Friday April 22. 

Monday  April 25 rolls around this is the 3rd week, NOTHING  has been done to the Deck.  NO contact at again from Adam or SOD.  Monday April 25 – Tuesday April 26th.

Tuesday night, April 26th I’m so frustrated, I email again,  thru builder trend and finally Angie’s list.  Pleading to get some answers from Adam.  All I want is our deck to be started.  
On Wednesday morning of April 27, 2016, I finally get a response from SOD, but they say   “I know that Karla and Adam are working on getting the pricing for you. They are just trying to collect all the information they need in order to give you an accurate price.”  Why didn’t they call us at all for those 3 weeks?  NO contact, ignoring our emails.
Later in the day, Oren Dagan contacts us via Buildertrend.com.  He says he wants to start the project next week, but he wanted to know:
•Do you want us to start working on the kitchen at the same time.
•Do you have the permit ready for the kitchen?Is your architect going to do that?
•Do you have the engineering (if needed) drawing for the wall removal?
•Are you ok with us starting the deck already, before the kitchen or do you want it all in once?
•Can you provide me with few days that i can send the carpenter over?
•Have you chosen your appliances, fixtures, hardware and etc for the kitchen? do you need any help or list of items needed?

WTF!! We talked to Adam about this way in the beginning during the quote.  He took lots of notes. He even itemized all these items on the agreement that we signed.   It’s like we are starting all over again! All they wanted was their deposit from us. 

We were totally frustrated."
5,"Oren from SOD builders was our lead contractor for our complete home renovation. After the initial design that we got from the architect and speedy construction, Oren did a great job by helped us with design of floorings, bathrooms, light fixtures, countertops, marble and tile work. We know that it’s hard and rare to find a contractor that have the qualities and abilities that required to create the perfect project but also patient, supportive and highly determined to get the remodeling project done. Oren, the on-site contractor and supervisor, did an outstanding work. The rooms came out beautiful with open space, light and clearly creative while at the same token, fits to our style which is warm and personal. Because this was the first time we did a home remodeling, it was a big deal to us that Oren will be able to absorb our vision for our house in terms of its style, realism, beauty and potential. SOD builders was equal to the task! We basically love the new kitchen that Oren designed and implemented at the house, the high ceiling in the media room, the marble master suite, the light engineered wood flooring, the amazing molding and the guest bathroom. We know that many contractors or construction companies could built our house, but what SOD builders can offer is a passion for your home and a promise that they are equal to the task of fulfilling its promise in the absolute standard of honesty and integrity to which they clearly hold themselves."
5,"I hired SOD builders to bring the backyard finally to life. My house is a new construction house and the lot was mainly dirt. This project was a challenging one because of the uneven space and I wanted to extend it by removing part of the hill side of the back yard.
 After spoking with an office personal from SOD builders, for the initial meeting that I had with them, I met with Oren. Oren was able to provide me with 2 designs including an estimate for each one of them in order to help me get few ideas of what I can do and mainly the cost of the extended lot. 
My main goal was to had an outdoor kitchen that will include:
-BBQ area with nice seating table and chairs.
-Rounded fire pit that will be surrounded by a stone bench with pillows.
-Grass area.
-Outdoor patio that will be inside/outside seating. This was my main goal in this remodeling and the most important task.
My main concern was that during the past, I did some remodeling work and my experience with them was not good at all. In one of the cases, the contractor just left the site in the middle and never came back to finish the work. Luckily enough, this was not the case with SOD builders. Oren was particularly educated about this type of projects and he provided great recommendations. Sure enough, there were some problems and issues, but Oren solved them when they arrived and without involving us too much with the solutions. This could only happened when you have all this extensive experience with what you do and love to do. I was mainly fascinated with the hard working and ethic of the actual workers. I can state that they always came to work at the house on time, they were polite and made sure not to leave a mess after each working day. SOD builders did such an excellent job and each time I hear a good word from someone that visit my house, I feel much happier about SOD builders and MAINLY Oren."
5,"We used SOD builders, Inc. for our kitchen remodeling project. This remodeling included all the new and custom (upper and lower) cabinets with an island in the center of the kitchen that added so much beauty and functionality to the super strange kitchen layout. The quality of the wood cabinets is really great and high. Great thick wood, anti-slam doors, changeable shelves, modified doors, and even custom handles. Oren from SOD builders, Inc. installed all the counter tops that matched perfectly with the wood. The island that we did, was furnished with the under sink and wine cooler. The efficient recessed lights and the low voltage lights in the upper cabinets added so much functionality features to the kitchen which was excellent. The engineered wood flooring was installed by Oren’s workers in the kitchen after Oren helped me personally to get a great discount on from his vendor. And Last thing was the back-splash who also was installed beautifully. Oren is a remarkable contractor in the Los Angeles area. He provide outstanding customer service and deliver a great construction. He also have a very professional and great staff.  When I contacted Oren for the first time, I felt I was in good hands. He had an incredible attitude, and he arrived ready to the appointment. The remodeling project was managed in a fast pace and everything was remodeled with real knowledgeable specialists. Looking how the working crew was working on the kitchen was pretty substantial. They were very accurate, detailed and cared about quality. I was surprised to see the crew cleaning the site after finishing their daily work. At the end, we had a very good experience with Oren from SOD builders, Inc. and we are very pleased with the great work and final price. I highly recommend SOD builders, Inc. construction."
5,"Oren and his team from SOD builders were fantastic people to work and deal with for the remodeling project that they did at my house. They remodeled my kitchen, 2 bathrooms and the 2 bedrooms. In the kitchen we remodeled the whole kitchen by replacing the cabinets, counter top, back splash, lightings, sinks, appliances and all the hardware. Oren and the designer were able to design the kitchen completely on a set of 3D designs and they were able to do it as close as possible to the real thing. This design was a great feature that allow us to see how it will look in reality. The bathrooms were also designed and planned by Oren and his office. The bathrooms were demolished completely and Oren redesigned it completely by replacing the shower (in one of them) and the bath tub and shower in the other one. On top of that, He installed all the vanities, faucets, lights, outlets and floor. The bedrooms were the easy ones because all we did was the new paint, crown molding, closet and carpet. Oren made sure that the rooms will be ready first so we can live in the house while the other spaces are being remodeled. We noticed that Oren has a great attention for aesthetics, functionality and beauty, He always keeps the resale value of the house in mind just and he kept mentioning that to us in case we will thing to sell the house in the future. His communications skills added a great amount of trust and happiness and even the suggestions that he gave us in regards to the whole remodeling were a good plus. They were very patient with us during the selection process of all the materials, and even coming back multiple times when our little ones prevented us from being as efficient as we hoped. We've heard so many bad stories of contractors that either left in the middle or did a bad job that caused to redo all the work again. This was certainly not the case with SOD builders and the people there, they were efficient and even surprises happened, they did the work without any additional fees. The only increase that we had was when we decided to increase the work around the fireplace in the living room. We will recommend SOD builders to our friends and family, and we will show their work s referrals. We usually don’t give reviews, but they were worthy."
5,"I recently had the powder room at my house completed remodeled by Oren and his workers from SOD builders. The old powder room had so many issues and it was not functional enough to our needs. It was originally done by the original builder so Oren and his team had a few challenges on their hands due to the bad existing layout. Oren was able to address all the issues with the powder room by maximize the space and installing as many cabinets as he could and I am extremely pleased with the end results. His team of workers installed new drywall, fully sanded and painted the walls and ceiling with color combination that was recommended to me by Oren at one of our meetings before I hired them, they also fixed the plumbing and replaced some of the pipes, did a complete electrical work by adding several outlets and switches and installed the vanity, toilet, and tile flooring. Oren made sure to provide me each daily with any update on the project and he made sure I was happy with every detail and stage of the powder room. He was extremely patient and understood exactly what I wanted.  I am very particular about my home and I stressed to Oren how important it was for me to have every perfect. Oren understood and reassured me that he would make sure I was happy with the results. Oren and his team exceeded my expectations which is pretty hard to do. I recommend SOD builders for anyone looking for a quality contractor to remodel their home.  I will definitely be using SOD builders for future projects in my home."
5,"Hiring SOD builders and working with Oren was a great and smart decision to do. 
We recently did our huge kitchen transformation. The job included the removal of few walls, ceilings popcorn being removed, new plumbing, new lighting and outlets with some smart home features etc...The interview process was very intense and massive. We feel we interviewed a fairly amount of contractors (7)! We talked and met a variety of people/companies, from small to large. We called to each one and spoke to them over the phone and did a research about them making sure that they have valid license, insurance and bond. We talked to few secretaries that couldn’t say our names correctly even and made mistakes with the appointment schedules.  When we called Oren from SOD builders he (the owner) answered...huge and big advantage on the rest. Some of the contractors that visited our house for an estimate would either agree to all of our requests by saying, ""absolutely or of course"" yes we can knock down this wall and not worry about support.  And some of them kept telling me how they wanted to model our kitchen, not listening to our requests or ideas... Oren was a very straight to the point kind of guy and without any selling stories.  He told us we could knock down walls but be sure about any support beams that would have to stay or replaced.  The first day we talked through the design and all the financing options.  Since it was our first big project, we honestly didn’t have any idea about how much it could cost. The demolition was quick and clean. It took them only 2 days to complete this task. The working team were very nice to us and we got to know a lot about them. They made sure to use plastic covers every day and sweep up at the end of every day and made sure our house was livable. We ran into some of the beam support issues we mentioned above.  Oren came up with a great solution that caused us to redesign the kitchen look. Oren came up with a suitable layout that worked for us.  This actually changed the focal point of the kitchen and we loved the new look with this change. The project took a bit longer than we thought it would but was within the time frame that Oren promised us.  We could've had it done in less time but we wanted to take our time and to make sure that we are comfortable.  The final kitchen is really stunning. We can see that there was a lot love, care, special touch and craftsmanship into the smallest finishing details. Oren was on site almost every day.  If it wasn't him, then his foreman was.  He was equally as professional and committed as Oren was.  Oren saw every step all the way through and ensured no detail was over looked.  There was even a few details we asked for at the beginning of the project that we failed to remind him of that made its way into the final product.  We were really happy to see this. There were several of small problems and things that needed to be addressed after the project ended, but Oren was there.  He popped in to make sure all was still good.  He does this because the house needs a chance to settle in a bit.  He addressed them no problem. OVERALL EXCEPTIONAL JOB by Oren and his team at SOD builders.  We will definitely be working with him again!!!"
5,"We recently hired SOD builders for a few projects at the house. The remodeling project was including: 
-Adding a balcony Door and window from the bedroom to the patio/backyard, 
-Full complete bathroom remodeling. 
-New fireplace and mantel installation. 
-Re-tiling the entryway and the kitchen with dining area.  
 Oren and the workers definitely won our business after meeting us at the house and worked around our budget and they delivered exactly the results that we were hoping to get from them. Oren was very professional and knowledgably throughout the whole time of the remodeling and any issue that we had with anything, Oren was able correct it. He was also extremely helpful by explaining us how things would look after we had trouble visualizing few things, like the pattern of the tile. What really put them over the top in our book was that 3 weeks after… the remodeling was done. Oren called up to follow up (after the work was completed) and ask if everything was still to our satisfaction. I have noticed a few small gaps in the grout on the flashing around the shower but it never really bothered me too much.  But since he called, I mentioned this to him, and he sent one of his guys over to take care of it. Oren's worker also installed a new water regulator in the shower after the water pressure was too high after using it for a month. We are pleased with everything and would recommend to friends and would use them on future projects.

I have attached before and after photos of the fireplace and bathroom jobs, the work speaks for itself."
5,"We found SOD builders, after being frustrated in the past from other contractors. From the initial meeting that we had with Oren, we were impressed. Their values of customer satisfaction and their deliver everything they said. Oren was the manager of the work and he was on time for all the meetings that we had with him. He was very straight, kindly and motivated to be invited into our house. He came back and took all the measurements that he needed for the kitchen, asked us many questions about what we would like to include in the new kitchen and 3 days after, he brought us a 3D design for us to look at and see how it will most likely look like. It was exciting to see how fast they could generate a nice design. Oren knew what he’s doing and we were sure he has done this type of jobs many times before. Their prices are reasonable. We wanted our kitchen finished as soon as possible, so we agreed with Oren to start the following week. That gave us little time to buy all the appliances, hardware, countertops, tiles Etc… Oren personally went with us to 2 showrooms where we picked out our tiles and countertops. He also helped us to search and buy all the options for the (sink, faucet, hardware and more…). To be honest, I was probably a nightmare type of work. We moved out of our place during the month of the remodeling and we were a little worried that something would go wrong and we would end up on a terrifying remodeling show. Now after this remodeling is over, we can say clearly that is nothing to worry about when SOD builders are working at your house. Their workers was clean, friendly, willing to answer questions. I discovered that Oren visits the job site every few days, but he too sincerely cares about your home. He always called regarding the schedule, timeline or if there was a problem that need to be solved. We asked for changes to the electric wiring after the tiles have been installed. Would I recommend them to others? Absolutely yes. We will refer this company to all our friends."
5,"We would like to express our excellent experience with the remodeling of our house that was done by SOD builders and managed by Oren. Our recently completed full home remodeling that included:
-Master bedroom
-Master bathroom
-Hallway 
-Guest room remodeling
-Laundry room
The remodeling came out great and we are honestly enjoying each part of it due to the success of it. When we initially met with Oren in the beginning of this year, we discussed the first project which was to remodel the kitchen, laundry room and entry of the house. Prior to meeting with Oren, we met with several other contractors. Some were big companies that sent to us a salesman that tried to keep adding things and things that we didn’t need in order to make the estimate much bigger and with tons of promises that most likely can’t be fulfilled. What we knew from the past was, that in order to have the closest estimate as possible, we will need to have our own architect that will provide us with a fully detailed design of the work that we want to do and by that, we will know exactly what we need. Oren with his own expertise was able to see it and understand the design very easily and this was a real bonus and we could tell from our first meeting that he definitely brought much more to the table than the other contractors. What we didn’t know before Oren completed the remodeling, was how great his work will be and how efficient as well. We feel pretty much fortunate, as most of the time you hear horrible stories from people about construction. Oren and his team always kept us up to date and there was hardly a day when someone wasn’t at the house working. The team was trustworthy and competent, and we could always reach Oren and his staff at the office when we needed. For these reasons, we were very comfortable putting our second project in his hands. We would not hesitate to recommend Oren for any remodel or construction project. We thank him for making our home beautiful."
5,"From the first day I called SOD builders and met with Oren, I was impressed with their customer service very much and how they know to follow up everything. After talking to Oren over the phone and explaining to him my goals and what I would like to do, I knew instantly that this would be the company that I will hire to remodel my kitchen. Oren and Jacob, the owners are extremely knowledgeable And he know how to manage and handle every aspect of the remodeling, visit the house on a daily basis and perform regular checks about the progress of the remodeling and clearly not only takes pride in each and every work, but is knowledgeable and definitely involved in each step of the process. He, and his office manager Yael, and his interior designer, Rachael, guided me in all my decisions and made sure I stayed on budget and still get the most out of the needs in this remodeling without compromising any of the design elements I wanted and needed. The crew that were working under the supervision of Oren were hard workers and knew exactly what they need to do and they did it on the best side making sure that everything is in perfect finish. They were professionals and very polite. I have never dealt with workers like this before and I was extremely suppressed with them. In the bottom line, the new kitchen is beyond my expectations. We finished the remodeling of the new kitchen ahead of schedule and a little bit above budget (for some additions that we wanted to have and were not included in the initial estimate."
5,"At first, we wanted to remodel the kitchen at our house by our self, but we figured out that it will be so hard and complicated for us to even manage this type of a project so the best option was to hire a contractor instead and let him do it. This idea a great idea but the only challenge we had was that we wanted the kitchen to be done as soon as possible. We did our research through several online sites in order to find the “right contractor”. We were honestly impressed by the all the photos that we saw about SOD builders past projects and we decided to give them a call and to meet with them in order to determine if they are the right for us. In total, we interviewed 6 contractors (so frustrating and time consuming) and we looked over all the estimates that we got in order to compare them apple to apple and to scope the project. SOD builders estimate stood out because they were the one that reached out to us when we had all the hard and easy questions about the estimate. The kitchen space was the biggest issue because it supposed to be the main focal point in the house and the main space in our requirement in the remodeling. Oren had so many great ideas! He suggested us to tear down the wall that separating the living room from the kitchen. We loved this idea because it will give our home a big open space feeling AND connecting all rooms. At the end of the work, we were blown away by the new transformation. Oren listened to our ideas and he was able to incorporate all of them into the new design of the kitchen. All the work was done and completed on the time that we agreed before we signed the agreement with Oren. We couldn’t be happier with the way everything turned out. There is more work to be done in our home but we are holding off until things get more settled. SOD builder’s construction will be the first place we contact once we decide to move forward."
5,"I hired SOD builders for a 650 sq/ft. of living room addition. Before we hired them, we already had all the necessary plans on hand including all the secured building permits with the city. When it comes to workmanship and speed, I must admit that landmark construction was very fast while investing extra attention to perfection. All the teams of workers worked fast even when it came to fixes and adjustments. They replaced the wood floor with new engineered wood flooring, repainted the entire ceiling and one living room wall and blended new stucco on the exterior wall. The new addition required new foundation, framing, and window installation. We are thoroughly content with all the work that was completed by SOD builders. 
1)they made sure to cover everything all around the working area in order to prevent damages and extra work due to paint spots and dust from all the sanding. 
2)They came to work on a daily basis and few times they skipped work BUT they made sure to confirm that 2 days ahead. This was very responsible from them to do.
3)Oren the Project Manager was available and reached all the time. When he couldn’t talk or answered, he called within the hour.
In regards to pricing… the price that we got from SOD builders was in the middle range. Oren came over to the house several times to discuss about the details and the process of the project, and after that he start working on the estimate."
5,"I found this fantastic construction company almost by an accident, literary driving close by, and never regretted it. Few months ago I needed to renovate my kitchen and to make a very quick decisions on whom to hire to help with the design and with the actual construction. The personal at the company were very friendly and I was very lucky to find that my advisor, Oren, was available to take my kitchen remodeling project right away. We met a few times at my house, Oren explained me all details of all variations of the cabinets the company is working with, and I made my choice very quickly. The counter top was installed by another company that specialized in counter tops and Oren arranged a few meetings with the company without any delays and to my full satisfaction. The design part took very swift period and after few changes was approved and sent to production. The cabinets came directly from the factory on time and in good order and condition. Oren worked with workers, explaining them the details of the design and how it will need to look. We have chosen a contemporary cabinets for the new kitchen with several twists and new materials. By the end of the remodeling, the installation was very easy and painless, and I am very happy with the result.  I love the new kitchen and I would highly recommend Oren and SOD builders to anyone who needs high quality kitchen."
5,"I contacted SOD builders and spoke to Oren about what I would like to do at my house and what is my style and goals. Oren came over to my house on the day and time that we scheduled over the phone and he inspect the 2 bathrooms and kitchen. For a while we had major mold problems in the bathrooms and we start to have our concerns about it which caused us to do this remodeling ASAP. For this remodeling project, we spoke to few other contactors and we received few bids as well, but we still decided to go with SOD builders even though there was not big of a difference in the price, I was impressed with the way SOD builders and mainly with Oren. What caused that was the great communication that we had with him and his way of thinking and ideas. A week after the meeting and after we saw in details the design and estimate that Oren did for us, we signed the initial contract and we gave our approval to complete remodel the bathrooms and kitchen with Oren and his team and we set a date to start the work. The problem with mold that we had in the bathrooms, Oren brought his people to do the demolishing first and after that, they moved forward and start the construction. We were more than happy with the final results of the remodeling and we would recommend SOD builders to anybody we know. For us the total cost was the main issue that we have and after that was the communication. SOD builders was the only company that was able to work with us about the price and during the work, He made sure to stay in touch each few days with us throughout the remodel. Once again, Oren, Leslie and the actual people that did the remodeling were all outstanding. Everybody that worked on our home was friendly, very knowledgeable, and took great care in the work they did."
5,"I was referred to SOD builders by a neighbor who had a driveway installed. I had an old concrete backyard and old bricks on the front of my house. I met with Oren after I spoke and got the basic information from the office staff about how they work. 
Oren was able to present me so many available options for my backyard, front walkway, drains and chimney. His estimate included various options I could choose from and he was very fair. Oren was able to meet with me at one of his suppliers in Ventura and he helped me to select the pavers for the house. He was able to share his experience with the different types of products. 
Oren made sure to keep in touch by either calling or texting every day during the project and introduced me to Jacob who was the foreman. Both of them were extremely valuable as anytime there was a decision in cutting a paver, or locating a drain they provided their experience to make the best decision for my specific job. The crew worked hard all day, and cleaned up the debris on a regular basis. 
I am very happy with the job they did at the back of my house and in the front. The new look of the house is completely different now. I am considering another project on the side of my house, and there is no hesitation at all about who will I hire for that job. I will definitely hire SOD builders. I highly recommend them."
5,"We recently hired SOD builders and their crew of workers to design and remodel my new master bedroom that included the master bathroom as well for our house. Prior to the remodeling, I researched and met with three other contractors and designers and asked them for an estimate and referrals for that job and after meeting with all of them, I knew that Oren from SOD builders was the right contractor for me. Oren was extremely creative, honest and open minded person that cares a lot about the project from the begging of the work till the end. Before the work started and during the process of finding the right one, I was concerning is I do the right decision and what will happened if… to start this work, but after the work started and Oren start to appear at my house and supervised the actual work, all my fears and concerns vanish and it was a really smooth process. Oren and his team communicated with me before, during and after each stage of the work to make sure everything went smoothly and without any mistakes and more than that, he went above and beyond a lot of things that weren’t included to make sure that I get exactly what I wanted. Oren even went with me to select, buy and pick up all of the items that I needed for the project including the floors, paint, crown moldings, fixtures, stones for the vanities, doors etc.  He even helped me to make the final look as I always wanted. Things happened when he said they would happen and there weren't any big surprises or hiccups along the way. They completed the project on time AND MAINLY on the budget which was the biggest factor and fear in this whole work."
5,"I am so happy I choose SOD builders for my bathroom remodeling project at my house. During the years, I heard so many people's nightmare with contractors that caused me to do a triple search for a good company that can come and do the work without any hidden charges, and mainly to be able to complete the work. I was pretty nervous about the remodeling. After 5 estimates and meetings with contractors, I decided to go with SOD builders after my research about them showed me that they are a good company and that they are in business for a long time already. Oren was the project manager, He was very helpful, super nice and professional. I am kind of a picky person, and he was very patient with me. He came to my house or call me every day and check to make sure I am happy with every step on the way. Oren and his team worked six days a week, came on time, clean up every day. When they left, they made sure to keep the rest of the house as clean as possible. Now after my bathroom remodeling is completed, I have a beautiful new bathroom to enjoy. I am very happy with it! I absolutely recommend SOD builders. Remember to ask for Oren, you will not be disappointed."
5,"I just completed my full home remodeling that included the kitchen 3 bathrooms, Dining room and 2 bedrooms. SOD builders was the best construction company that I've worked with. Oren and his team of professionals were good with communication (they returned all my phone calls and emails within the same day of the following day) and were responsive to all our request, questions, ideas, thoughts and changes mainly when they start to open walls. They are fully licensed, bonded and insured contractors and came up with the proper paperwork to prove it. The initial pricing was competitive and logic while the add-ons we had during the work were very well priced. The kitchen remodeling included basically everything from new floor and new cabinets to new paint and island in the middle. The bathrooms were also remodeled and they needed to have new shower, vanities, plumbing and paint as well, and the bedrooms needed new paint and carpet with cabinets for the closets. 
The working crew and some in home vendors were on-time and at full size throughout the remodel. Jacob, the foreman, was great person to work and deal with. He came up with some great suggestions and ideas for changes that really improved the final work and few of them even made the work a bit cheaper and saved us money. The quality of the whole remodeling was more than excellent. It was completed on-time (2 months from start to finish) and on-budget – which was the main important thing in this whole work. The final items were addressed in a timely manner to our complete satisfaction. We've already recommended him to a friend and would highly recommend this company to anyone doing home remodeling. It was a pleasure working with them and when we finally decide how we want the living room lighting I'll have them back to do the work!"

5,"When I and my partner moved into the same house, we instantly realized that we will have to make several improvements in order to fit the house for both of us. The first thing that we had was the tiny sink in the master bathroom and the shower. This master bathroom was the first thing that we needed to do.  In addition to that there was not enough space for the both of us. We also had some plans in mind for this bathroom bedroom closet in order to make it as a walk-in closets. Once we agreed to a master bathroom and closet remodeling, we met with Oren from SOD builders and when he came over, he looked and took it from there. As part of our meeting with Oren. We brought up the idea about remodeling the kitchen, bedroom and to do the hardscape in the back and front of the house. By adding all of this as a one big deal, Oren and his workers were able to do much better work than what we thought to get. The bedroom is the master bedroom at the house and Oren redesigned it and gave it a completely new look and feel.  In the hardscape part of the house, Michelle (the designer of the company) came up with a brilliant concept of how it can be and the sketch of her design caught our attention immediately. Her design included all the new plants, trees, Stamp concrete and outdoor small kitchen with BBQ that included a bar, seating area and a fire pit. 
In the front of the house, she was able to design new entry to the house and several steps with nice rocks and tropical trees. The deal that we got from Oren, was very good and we took it. We were able to live at the house while they worked there and it was not as bad as we thought it will be. Oren made sure to concentrate at the house first and to do all the dirty work in all the spaces and then to do all the outdoor items. The work was completed after 3 months of work and without any major problem. The office communicated with us during the whole project and it made it easy and comfortable. If you're nervous about hiring a contractor, don't be! You just need to follow our advice and feel free to contact SOD builders."
5,"The work that we needed to do was kind of big. We had to interview several companies prior to execute the work. When we met Avi from SOD builders, we were kind of worried about what will he say or recommend us to do. Our thoughts were not good! Avi was pretty experienced with this type of projects. He was able to show us several projects that he did in the past and we were able to confirm them. The work that took more than 3 months, was pretty intense.  There were people each day working on the house. The roof people, the kitchen workers, and the windows. During all the time of the work, we met with Avi several times when we had to see and check all the plans prior to have them done. Avi was able to explain to us everything about the work. There was not a day that the workers missed to come over. The whole project went without any problem. All permits were taken care of by Avi and all we took care of were the payments. The price that we got from them was a little bit less than all the other estimates that we got."
5,"We remodeled our medium size kitchen (approximately 15 ft by 20 ft) that included new paint, new floor, lighting fixtures, Counter top and sink. The work was performed by Avi and his 4 workers. Avi worked hand by hand with them and made sure that our kitchen will be completed as we wanted. The work was divided by several sections. The first section was the demolition in which the workers removed the old kitchen including the drywalls and after that, was the installation of all the new lightings and cabinets. We were happy with the fact that Avi ordered all the materials for the kitchen and we only had to select the colors and types from the big selection of samples that Avi present us. The new kitchen was completed after 4 weeks when originally Avi promised us that it will be longer than that. His workers came to work each day and worked till late hours. We will recommend Avi to our friends and we are very happy with the new kitchen that he built for us."
5,"Avi from SOD builders was fantastic from start to finish of my remodeling project. He met me at the property several times to get a more detailed proposal together. He was informative, good communicator and honest. You know those types of contractors that just end up doing the bare minimum and still end up taking twice the amount of time they ""estimated?"" Avi doesn't that way. I unfortunately didn't choose him for our investment property but wish I had. The contractor I ended up choosing came from a personal reference and we had a good rapport but ended up doing exactly what I said above. Taking twice as long (a little bit of extra, unexpected work, and bad time management and perhaps scattered with a little lazy), and going over budget. Avi on the other hand I believe, from his detailed analysis of every little thing gave me the confidence that he would've finished near to the estimated completion time and would have done so responsibly and with enough detail that I wouldn't feel compelled to go back and go through every little thing to ensure I got my money's worth. During the whole remodeling at the house that included new floor, paint, lighting fixtures, closets and carpet Avi was there to make sure that everything is good and going according to the plan. Avi made sure also that the workers will cover all the things that they won’t replace so they will be protected while they were working."
5,"This is the second time that we use this company for a project at our house. A while back we used them in our previous house and we liked the way they worked, their price and the end results of the work that they did. This time was not difference. Out initial meeting was with Oren. He came to our house on the day and time that we scheduled ahead of time. When he came over, he looked at the bathroom and came up with some nice recommendations and ideas that can still fit in our budget and be nice. The bathroom includes: paint, vanity, Floor and shower. The massive work took over 2 weeks. Each day, Oren made sure to come over with his team of workers (3-4 each day) and to guide them on how things need to be done and what has been done since the last time he visited our house. The total amount was very fair and we didn't have any changes or hidden charges at all."
5,"SOD builders did a room addition to our house, it was clear that additions are their specialty. This is our first time remodeling so we were new to the process, Daniel, our project manager took a special care of everything that was involved in this addition from revising the plans, helping in choosing the final materials, purchasing them and making sure that they will arrive to the house on time so all the workers will keep working without stopping due to missing materials. The whole work went smoothly and without any problem. We are honestly and fully satisfied with the end results and we are so happy that we hired them. The workers arrived to the house always on time and didn’t miss any day during the work, they were honest and open to any idea that we had and answered to all of our questions when we had them. We knew we wanted to add another bedroom to our house but were not really sure about the specifics. Daniel shared his ideas while working with ours, Daniel and the workers truly know how to work with their customers which made this whole experience so much easier. In the past, we heard horrible stories in the past about companies surprising customers with hidden fees which results in paying more for the project than originally planned. The price we agreed on was the same from beginning to end. If you are looking for a trustworthy and dedicated company then we recommend SOD builders 100%"
5,"We highly recommend SOD Builders!  Extremely professional, competent and hard working.  Oren was extremely patient with us as we tried to work out how to get the kitchen of our dreams within our budget.  He genuinely wanted us to be 100% happy with the design before we committed.  The price Oren gave us was very competitive and included an interior designer, Carmit Oron, who pulled a beautiful, functional design together that is perfect for our busy family.  Oren made everything so stress free for us, he took care of all the details of the building permit and project management.
The workers turned up at our house on the set date and from then on we had workers in the house most days.  If they couldn’t make a day in the week they asked if it would be okay to come at the weekend.  They were reliable, polite, friendly and very tidy, putting up plastic screens to protect the house from dust and sweeping at the end of the day. We were connected to the whole team with the BuilderTrend App, this was invaluable as my husband and I both work and it allowed them to communicate with us and send photos of the progress.  Oren checked in with us regularly and and answered emails 24/7, always with his goal of us being happy, nothing was ever too big a problem.
We are so happy with our kitchen and I will be calling SOD to do our next projects.  Truly a first class construction company with exceptional customer service!  Calling SOD was the best decision I made!  I love my kitchen!"
5,"I contacted SOD builders to see what it will require to remodel my kitchen. At first I spoke to Michelle who was very nice and polite to me over the phone and she asked me some basic question in order to understand what my goals are. After that phone conversation, she asked me if I would like to schedule a meeting with Oren. The meeting was scheduled for the following week and Oren arrived to my house on the time frame that Michelle gave me (she was kind enough to even call me an hour before to make sure that I’m home and to inform me that Oren was on the way). The meeting with Oren was very good. Oren was able to provide me with good samples of cabinets, Floor and paint colors combinations. His main goal on that meeting was to see the existing kitchen and to get some measurements of the space in order to maximize the space. At the end of the meeting, Oren and I scheduled another meeting in order to present to me a 3D design of how the new kitchen will look like and how much will it cost me (even though I mentioned my max budget at the first meeting). The second meeting was very good as well. Oren presented to me the kitchen design that showed me how the new kitchen will look like and I was very impressed. After finalizing all the estimate, materials, colors and the price, Oren went back to his office in order to generate a schedule work plan so I will know what and when my new kitchen will be ready. The work went pretty smooth and it went according to the schedule plan that Oren did. The workers were nice and polite as well and Oren visited the house almost every day to make sure that the work is going according to plan. A month and a half after, my kitchen was completed and it came out even better than the one that I saw in the design."
5,"Very good company and people to work with! Originally we were interesting in removing a wall in the dining room area that will show a bigger open space. We spoke to several companies and we came across SOD builders. We loved the fact that they are having multiple offices with lots of years of experience and that in our initial meeting, we were able to get all the answers for our questions and the ideas that could improve our house. Oren, is a great communicator person and he has a good amount of knowledge when it comes to remodeling and design. He met with us several times and he also was able to give us a price that was very comparable to the other ones we got. The work started with the removal of the wall and it continued from there to the kitchen and bathrooms. We rebuild the space for the bath tub prior to the new installation of it and floor. We couldn't have been more pleased! Oren did expert work, very cleaned and detailed. They worked up daily and they were so nice and pleasant people.  We are so thrilled with this bathroom.  We had no idea it would look so nice... I can't recommend this company enough. SOD builders is the one stop shop place... they provide everything that you will need for the job.  If you are looking to upgrade or remodel your bath or kitchen, go with them!"
5,"We hired SOD BUILDERS, as the first project we decided to NOT complete ourselves due to some difficulties that came up and it was too much for us. We’re typically DIY-er’s and we are pretty good at it (if we do say so). Our kitchen project was much larger in scope than we could tackle and a friend recently had SOD BUILDERS complete their kitchen. We didn’t shop around and we trusted on our friend recommendation and we also saw the finished kitchen that they did. Our initial meeting with Oren, just gave us all the information we needed in order to give the approval for this project. We were paired up with Oren, who visited our home, listened to our ideas and took them to the next level. His details and space planning expertise was good & complemented by Juan to help select finishes. This was also the first time I put my trust in others to select or at least to help us with finding finishes and materials. Their pricing for this project was reasonable and worthy, the project management and coordination was painless and the overall results are stunning."
5,"My husband and I purchased our home in last year that needed of lot of remodeling.  The house was in a very bad condition and it needed to be fully renovated. From our past experience, we knew how the process was going but we were fully committed to finding the right contractor for this and to get this renovation project going and complete. It pretty sad to see that no one in my family, friends or neighbors were able to refer someone they had used in the past because they had such a bad experience during or after the remodeling. We interviewed pretty much a lot of contractors but we must say that Eran from SOD builders was the most honest and pleasant contractor we've met from all the other ones. From the very beginning he told us what to expect and what we need to do before hiring ‘A’ contractor. He initially told us we need an architect to change the structure and layout of the house. We tried to differ from his advice but we realized he was right about hiring the architect. We needed an architect to legally change the structure and layout of our house. Eran invested time to gain our trust by presenting to us some of his previous jobs for reference. His estimate (SOD builders) was not extremely low which means his work was not low quality but it was not extremely high either. it was in the middle!  We believe his price was very fair and reasonable for all the amount of work we required. Now after the work is completes, I can write that I am very happy we decided to hire him for this project. 
From the moment Eran took over this project, his team has made this process a lot easier for us. they completed the demolition of our home in 4 days which was impressive! They began by leveling out the floors and created the new layout of our home right after. They were knowledgeable, well experienced and they followed all the steps and stages in the plans. Everything that was on paper was coming to life right before our eyes and it was an unforgettable experience. The footing & foundation are very solid, the framing, exterior finishing and the interior finishing were remarkable and used great materials. Overall, his team are highly skilled contractors and I will forever be grateful for their talent and exceptional customer service. His team was extremely professional, respectful, hardworking and reliable individuals. They were always united, always on time and always available to answer our questions. It was such a beautiful, pleasant experience that I will always speak very highly of SOD builders and I will never trust anyone else other than this team to do work in my house or any other project I may face in the near future."
5,"We had a great experience with Oren from SOD builders. Oren was able to do a good job at our house remodeling the master bathroom and bedroom of our kids with his bathroom too.
The bathroom in our kid’s room is jack and Jill that has a shower/tub with large vanity. The decision to work with Oren and his workers was taken after several meetings with him and his designer Michelle. Michelle was very creative with her ideas about what to do and Oren explained to us each step and stage of the remodeling. The materials were selected by Oren and he gave us several options after he learned what we would like to do and what type of styles we love. The work in the bathroom included the removal all the old tiles, bath tub and shower and install new ones with the design that we selected. The work came out very good and it brought a new life to the bathroom including the new shower handles, Paint, vanity with sink and faucet.
The master bedroom required more work due to the age of it. We wanted to have marble floor, and special tiles all over the walls, paint and some extra storage cabinets that will allow us to have extra space. Oren worked with his workers on this project on a daily basis and the remodeling came out very good. Oren was able to assign 2 teams of workers to our house and to make sure that the work will end according to schedule."
5,"Oren, from SOD builders, is great general contractor I have ever hired. A close friend recommended him and I couldn't be happier. Oren first did some smaller jobs, like replacing all our toilets with water-saving models. He also fixed a serious leakage problem that we didn't know about because it was caused by the flooring people not putting in the correct toilet seal. The musty smell that we couldn't find is now gone. He finished a bathroom remodel, tearing out the vinyl shower/tub and replacing it with a Jacuzzi whirlpool tub. The bathroom was quite large and now looks even larger, not to mention beautiful. He and his workers on the tub and tile installation that was complex and time-consuming. I was especially happy that he was able to adjust what I wanted to do to keep me within my budget by suggesting different tiling pattern choices. We went with his suggestions and it is so much better than what we were going to do. We would highly recommend Oren for repair work and remodels, though we hope he doesn't get too busy. We have started a new to-do list for him."
5,"This company (SOD Builders) proved to me how great they are! It’s hard to remodel a house especially when you don t know where to start from or what to begin with. I found SOD Builders on several places including a magazine and I called to their office and spoke to Sofia. Sofia scheduled an appointment with Oren and she also called me an hour before to confirm the appointment. Oren came over and after a 2 hours meeting, he was able to give me an estimate for the kitchen. He was so good of explaining the all the building and safety codes so I was pretty amazed with his knowledge .He didn't push me to sign anything like other companies did and he wanted to have another meeting with me in order to show me a design of the new kitchen. I liked that so, after the second appointment and looking at his new design of the kitchen, I decided to hire him. His team of demolition people, carpenters, framers etc... Was so knowledgeable and clean .This guys do know how to take care of customers and how to work clean and good. Oren was coming almost every day to check the work and go over the details with me again in order to make sure we don’t miss anything and that I’m happy with the current progress. The job turn out great .Oren made sure that I will not have to pay any other fee more over the contract. I would recommend him to all my friend. I am very HAPPY"
5,"Oren with SOD builders was the Manager that managed our remodeling project and his end results work and schedule was just perfect.  I know when usually you start a remodeling project of any kind, you figure the schedule to be very flexible and the remodeling project to always take weeks or months to finish beyond what the contractor says, but in my review here I would like to tell you that Oren and his crew of people finished on time.  All the workers worked every day and did not miss one day or late, and the work was without any doubt top notch.  I had, really, nothing to complain about.  Therefore Oren and SOD builders deserve this positive.  What I liked most in this remodeling was that Oren made sure that the workers will know exactly what do each day and that all the materials will be at the house waiting for them and not the other way around."
5,"I had two bathrooms completely remodeled with SOD builders (Oren). Oren did a great & quality work and delivered 100% on budget. I was concerned about any hidden problems or charges at first, since I had some concern there were few leaking pipes behind the wall that might have caused an issue. Oren and his guys did a thorough probe testing before starting and making their estimates. Everything ended up very well and I got two beautiful new bathrooms, even though it was one week behind schedule but completely on budget which was great thing after all! Our experiences with Oren (The supervisor) and the Designer on top of the tradesmen were 100% positive. They took our need to leave in the house a fully functioning bathroom at all time and made it happen (I must mentioned that several other companies told us clearly that it will be 'impossible' to have it when I got an estimate from them - that was also more reasons to what SOD builders gave us and lived up to). I am very pleased with our choice and the results."
5,"I have no complains about this company and the people that worked at my house. At my house, Oren sent 4 workers that came over and did all the paint work. They covered everything and made sure to move all the bulky items so they won’t get damaged. After they finished the work, they returned and arranged the items and then moved to the next area. Oren assigned to my house his supervisor Charlie and he visited the house several times during the work time and made sure that we are happy and that there are no problems. Most of the paint work was a sponge paint with 2 colors but the common areas were with a special paint which took longer to do. I'm very happy with this company and I highly recommend them for any paint work."
5,"SOD builders just finished a full remodeling of our house. It all started with our meeting with Oren and Michele by measuring and understanding what we want to do. Michele came over several times and presented to us her designs and Oren was the person that tried each time to improve the space and to maximize the quality of the materials. The remodeling started with the Kitchen and bathroom at the same stage of work, while the work in the kitchen in process, Oren and his workers started to work on the dining room & laundry room. The plumbing and main rain replacement repairs work was done by several of his people and they did a great job in that part too. The kitchen that we remodeled was with oak wood and included an island, counter tops, new outlets and appliances.
The hallways contained several closets and storage spaces that were designed and installed by Oren and his people. All exterior windows and texture coated the exterior of our house. We had never before taken on anything like this and Oren walked us through every step of the way from permitting to code to design explaining what needed to be done in realistic steps. The crew of workers showed up to the house on time every day and did a very professional job in all respects. Any difficulties were taken care of immediately by either Oren or Avi. Many great ideas came from these 2 and also from Michel. The proof that SOD builders are great company is at the end results, as now we have a beautiful home with all the modern touches and for much less than other bids that had much less work involved. Everything that Oren said he would do, he did. I would recommend SOD builders for any size job you have in mind, they stand by their word."
5,"SOD builders provided us with an amazing customer service throughout the process of the remodeling from start to end. Their prices were very competitive. It doesn't get much better than this. We were having foundation work done on my elderly mother's home in LA. We arranged this remotely via a friend that recommended us to Avi and Oren. Avi took time, care, and patience to make sure that the remodeling will be comfortable with the process and to answer each and every one of our questions. This alone makes us recommend them as highly as possible. Customer service of this level is very very rare today. The work that they did was managed by Oren. Oren brought his 3 men team and made sure they will do an amazing work and as fast as they could.  I would use this company again without any hesitation. I'd give 6 stars if I could."
5,"we LOVE LOVE LOVE SOD builders. this is the THIRD time we are using them over the last ten years, each for progressively bigger and bigger jobs. they are so kind and on top of stuff and just get it done. they have a manager assigned to the task so you have someone you can always call and they have someone for everything. just whatever you need. and they do it right. 
whether it was little finishing touches or knowing just how to redo our old hardwood floors, what sink to put in, how to fix our cabinets, fixing the deck outside, making our outdoor area a beautiful patio space we now love, making beautiful built ins for us, interior and exterior painting, fencing, electrical, refreshing our kitchen so that now it is just gorgeous, all of it, just done perfectly. 
literally, i cannot say enough good things. i would never ever use another contractor. working with SOD feel like you have an uncle in the business that you can just call when you need help. and you know will be taken care of like family. 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
5,"Great company and people to deal and work with! The main thing that I liked in this remodeling was the communication and the care that Oren showed me. He gave me the feeling that his is remodeling his own bathroom and he cared for every detail in the remodeling. The bathroom remodeling that I did, started with the selection of all the materials, color combinations and all the hardware that Oren will install in the bathroom. Oren planned everything pretty good and he made sure not to have any extra materials so the total amount will remain the same. At the end of the remodeling, the total price was the same as the original estimate and this meant a lot to me because I heard so many stories where the final price become higher due to extra items that the contractor add during the remodeling."
5,"We had the need to enlarge the bathroom and to add a bath tub. We spoke to several contractors and companies about this project and we met with few of them. When we spoke to SOD builders. The person that we spoke with was very nice and polite. She scheduled a meeting with Adam. Adam came over at the time frame that was scheduled ahead by the office and he was the person that was able to give us a good quote for that and we were able to speak to some of his past. After we approved the quote and gave our OK to start, Adam sent his workers to start work. The work started with the demolition of the existing bathroom and adding the new frames. Then, all the plumbing and drainage was completed with the lighting. When all of that was completed, they did all the drywall and paint including all the electricity. The floor was one of the last items that they did and it came out great. I want to mention that we enjoyed working with Adam and his team of workers. They are nice and professional people."
5,"We recently had a master bath and a guest bath remodel with SOD BUILDERS.
Their project manager Lance was very helpful in choosing the right materials and answered all our questions in every step!
The team was very friendly, respectful and cleaned every day the work was done...
Although some issues/extra fixes came up, they could finish project on time.
Best customer service from the office too.
Love our new baths!"
5,"This was my first remodel, and it was a large project for a small space. SOD was very professional from the beginning. I never felt nickel and dimed which is typical for construction companies in this market. The workers, project managers and management were very responsive and focused on making sure I was happy with the work. The quality of the remodel was excellent. I've gotten so many compliments from guests who have seen my gorgeous, new bathrooms."
5,"Look no further! The construction team from ""SOD Builders"" saved my life after a stupid contractor disappeared leaving my house roof bathroom and kitchen un-finished ,he left trash all over and my roof was open,uncovered and literally exposed to the rain,wind and weather...
I found SOD Builders on HOUZZ and made a decision to hire them after interviewing Oren and Michelle ,
They were able to address the issues we had and found ways to help us to complete the work in minimum time and cost (!!!).
Me and my wife can't explain how we thank this company since they are our new angels!!!
Thank you ! thank you ! Thank you!
We are going to recommend SOD to anyone who need construction and home improvement work!"
5,"We've remodeled several homes, and SOD Builders was by far the best experience we've ever had working with contractors. 
We remodeled our entire home and added 800SF to the back of the house.
The build pool house (we can't wait to use it this coming summer). Either Oren or Adam was on the Job Site almost every day, the workman were courteous and cleaned up after themselves, and the job was finished ahead of scheduled and turned out beautiful. We could not give a higher recommendation. Excellent company to work with."
2,"I've been waiting for awhile to write this review. I was genuinely hoping things would have worked out between us and SOD but that was not the case. To be completely upfront we never got to the actual building/construction part of our relationship with SOD. We worked with them for over a year and ultimately left with a sour taste in our mouth over the whole experience. I'm giving two stars because even though we didn't end up working with them their designer (Michele (sp?)) and some of their staff were great to work with. 

We wanted to do the following to our home:
Remodel master bathroom
Master bedroom - Install new flooring, paint, and sliding glass door/one window replaced (They quoted $10,000 for *just* this - FYI)
Stairs - refinished
Living - build a custom bar, resurface fireplace

We reached out to SOD through Houzz and they were prompt to reply. They sent someone out to give us a quote. Everything went fine, and we called a few times after that but never received the quote. After a few months (we were slow to follow-up too) they sent someone else out to give us another quote as it had been awhile since the first guy had come out to our house. That's when we started working with Michael and things went terribly from that point on. I mean very very terribly. 

Michael came out and did a walk through of the house with us. He was having a hard time grasping what we wanted and wasn't understanding our vision. On top of that we were having a hard time understanding him and what was included in their services. At this point we were becoming frustrated but Michael assured us everything would be fine. After a month we received the quote from him. It was extremely poorly written and we couldn't tell what was included and what wasn't. We had three separate phone calls with Michael and still couldn't tell what we were getting. We said we wanted to think it over for a few weeks. After a month we again contacted Michael and asked about the price difference between adding a bathtub to the master or not. He then told us we would need to pay him $5,000 for an architectural designer before he would do anymore with us. This set off major red flags for us. We were told before that design was included with SOD. Michael then said he was going to be out of town but he wanted to send his colleague, Ram, to our home to see it and take some measurements that he missed. We thought that was weird but agreed to call and set-up a time with Ram. After speaking with Ram it became VERY clear to Ram and to us that Michael hadn't work for SOD in over a month and Ram was very panicky because he thought Michael had told us when he clearly hadn't. The most alarming part was NO ONE FROM SOD EVER CALLED US TO TELL US. So, we almost signed a contract with some other company and didn't even know it....

At that point we called SOD and I feel like we were super reasonable since they never bothered to tell Michael's clients he had left the company. We just asked to meet with someone else. They sent their designer out to our home. She was great and really restored our faith in SOD. When the owner returned he came out and sent us a new quote. We were discouraged to see the same quote style from Michael and ended up having to have ANOTHER call with the owner to figure out what was included and what wasn't. We solved it by making a spreadsheet since about 10 items we asked for didn't show up in the quote AT ALL. After that we took their final numbers and compared them to what Michael provided us in his first quote when he actually worked for SOD and they were much higher. We approached the owned about the difference and he said - doesn't matter. I won't go down to that price. So, he wouldn't honor a price his former employee made and we spoke to SOD again. 

They never called us after that. They never made any attempt to do right by us even though they basically set us up with someone who tried to defraud us. I am honestly just 100% disappointed in the whole experience. 

I think they do great remodel/construction work if you can get past the poorly explained process, bad company organization, and lack of customer service. We didn't and we lost a year of our lives to it. I would not recommend SOD to anyone, and I don't think they care about what they did to us or how our project was handled."
5,"I met with Eran from SOD last Spring and he had a lot of great ideas for my kitchen and bath remodel. Their bid was very competitive and I selected SOD to do the project. One of the key differentiation was that Eran did 3D renderings of the space and we went through several rounds before finalizing the scope of work. This was a great way to finalize all of the details in a visual way, which saved me on hiring a designer and undoubtedly saved a lot of rounds of changes once construction began. Throughout the project, everyone from SOD was incredibly responsive and Eran was my point of contact throughout the entire project. He's easy to work with, highly service-oriented, and always available by phone/text or email.

SOD has a large team with plumbers, electricians and provides full services - from counters to flooring and shower doors. The quality of the work was very high and they were also receptive to getting the smallest details just right. I was most impressed after the job finished when Eran and team went above and beyond to make sure that every last detail was taken care of.

SOD is an entrepreneurial, modern construction company and I would use them again."
5,"I would definitely use SOD again for any future remodeling projects. During the initial process of getting bids from various vendors, they were not the cheapest or the most expensive, but they had the best customer service and that is what won me over. This being the first time I've ever done a remodel, I went over every detail of the bid and checked their referrals, licenses, insurance coverage, etc. Even before I committed, Daniel was super great at responding and answering all of my questions and putting me at ease. The process was painless and ""pressure free"" and I very much appreciate their approach.

Daniel was an absolute pleasure to work with and his team did a wonderful job. They were polite, courteous, considerate (they made sure to cover areas that they would be walking through, cleaned up the area daily, etc), and very accommodating during the entire process, especially with changes along the way. They remodeled both bathrooms at the same time from demolition to finish. It was hard living with both bathrooms being done simultaneously and seeing as how these were my only bathrooms in my home, my ""must-have"" was to have a working toilet during the remodel (showering could be done elsewhere, but a working toilet was deal breaker for me!). They not only finished ahead of schedule (total time: about 5 weeks), but they also did a few extra's for me i.e. installing a ceiling fan, replacing hallway ceiling lights. The results were remarkable and I couldn't be more pleased with the results. I've received many compliments on the work and have referred them to several friends and co-workers and will continue to do so.

I would not hesitate to use them again. When I remodel my kitchen, I plan on using them again."
5,"I chose SOD for a complete kitchen remodel and plumbing upgrade. Working with the designer Michelle was a pleasure.  She had a clear sense of what we were looking for and knew just when to offer her opinion as we were sorting through the dizzying array of options.  When the building actually began, everyone at SOD was easy to contact, the crew always professional.  There were a few glitches, but they were minor, nothing out of the ordinary for such an extensive job. 

Early in the process, Oren, the owner of the company, told me that he would do whatever it took to make sure I was happy at the end of the job--and he completely delivered.  There was no request that wasn't honored, no small issue that was ever contested. They never made me feel picky, even though there were times I felt that way.  Oren called me a few months after the job was done to make sure I was happy.  When I mentioned a few minor issues that had come up (a cabinet door was sticking and the faucet had worked a little loose) he had someone come out within a day to take care of them. SOD didn't give me the cheapest bid (they weren't the most expensive either, for the record) but it's worth a little extra money to find a builder that does beautiful work and is willing to work with you to make sure you're satisfied."
5,"Oren, the general contractor, gave us a bid that was reasonable and when he came to our house he brought his designer Michelle, who showed us pictures and gave us ideas about what could be done to our house.  Michelle was with us to help pick out tile, granite slabs, paint colors, and cabinet styles.  The job itself had one hic-up but was remidied by Oren.  The foreman/woman that was assigned to our job told us that if we had any questions we could call her day or night and she would be available.  This turned out not to be the case and Oren eventually let her go and we were given a new foreman, Robert, who was available whenever we needed help.
   Overall everything went well.  Oren had workers at our house just about every day and the workers were very professional in doing their jobs.  They even swept up at the end of the day so we wouldn't track dust into the rest of the house.  Our remodel started on January 6th and was completely finished by March 14th.  I have waited until now (6 months after completion) to see if anything went wrong before giving my review and I can honestly say that everything has held up well.  No cracks in the drywall, and no leaks anywhere.  Given all that was accomplished in just over 2 months I would say that Oren and his crew did a wonderful job."
5,"I am extremely pleased with the job that SOD Builders did for me: a full kitchen remodel, including a complete gut and redesign of the room.   The quality of their work was top-notch, the workers were always professional, respectful, and friendly.   In particular, SOD's designer was very helpful in bringing my vision to life.

No project of this magnitude is completely glitch free, but SOD was very responsive to my every request.  This is not a contractor you have to worry about deserting you mid-job.  

The answer to the ultimate question ""Would I hire them again for other work?"" is ""Absolutely"".  Though it took a bit longer than I would have liked to complete the job, in the end I couldn't be happier with the results.  I will enjoy this space for decades to come."
5,"We absolutely love Oren and SOD Builders, Inc.  After meeting with multiple contractors to remodel our entire home and we added 1500SF to it, Oren was a breath of fresh air.  He wasn’t pushy like most other contractors.  Instead, he was polite, knowledgeable, trustworthy and professional.  This project was our first re-model (pretty massive for first remodel) and we didn’t know anything about the process.  Oren guided us through everything from start to finish. He listened carefully to what we wanted, gave us suggestions, and showed us lots of examples on his computer of other homes he had remodeled and build.  Lance and Michelle went with us to stores to help us pick out everything in our home--appliances, tile, and counters. They built us all custom cabinets  He was patient and supportive, always offering his perspective and advice and helping us make color and style decisions.  He, Michelle (our head designer), and the rest of their team were all a pleasure to work with.  They were hardworking, polite, knowledgeable, paid attention to every detail, and showed true pride in their work.  Lesmi checked in with us every day, either by phone call or by email.  The crew cleaned up at the end of each day.  The team was so efficient that, despite us adding a few additional projects along the way, they finished the project ahead of schedule.  And, we are extremely happy with our new home.  It is more beautiful than we could have imagined and we are so thankful to Oren and his team.  We have already recommended SOD Builders to family and friends and are looking forward to having him redo our rental home in the near future."
5,"We called SOD to start a kitchen remodel.  During the time they quoting us on the kitchen our hall bathroom's pipes exploded and we decided this project was more pressing.  We were glad that we got to work with this company on a smaller project before tackling the huge project of our kitchen remodel.  SOD did an awesome job with the bathroom.  We are extremely happy with our new modern bathroom. It is beautiful.  We always felt comfortable with all the specialists that came to work on the house. The work they did was top notch.  Any questions or concerns we had during the project were addressed quickly.  They also helped us to figure out design details, and since this is not my forte we really appreciated the guidance.  

We were so happy with the bathroom remodel that they are working on our kitchen now.  It is coming together beautifully.  I would absolutely recommend them for any project that you have."
5,"We love our kitchen and what's even more amazing, we still love everyone at SOD.  Through every step of the way, we felt like Oren, Michelle and team did everything in their power to give us exactly what we wanted, or, as was often the case, something better than we could have imagined.   We are a bit clueless on the design front.  We knew we wanted a Dwell worthy high end kitchen that had warmth and natural stone elements while still being sleek and modern. We had no idea how to do this.  Michelle helped us design the kitchen, change the layout, reposition things, and redesign the kitchen again.  She helped us select materials, match stain samples, hardware, everything. And this ""call me anytime and I will pick up or call you immediately"" service is just part of the deal. It's how SOD operates. 

If there was ever anything that we were unhappy about, it was addressed immediately. I believe someone came out three times to make sure the wall of cabinetry fit into the soffit line perfectly. We chose an incredibly difficult tile to install for our backsplash. Each tile is individually cut and affixed to paper.  The tiler pulled out individual tiles that we felt were too dark or light or misshapen... dozens of them, until it looked perfect. They were very accommodating when working with the Miele specs for the custom panel refrigerator and even redid a panel when we saw a blemish. The cabinetry makers SOD uses are craftsmen and you can tell when you look at the end result and feel the substantial drawers and cabinets in your hand. The cabinetry and drawer hardware used is on par with what Poggenpohl and Boffi.  After months and months of hard use, I still get a little thrill every time the drawers soft close smoothly. 

When we were conducting our search we were looking for quality, excellent customer service and affordability. SOD provides all of these. NOT ONCE did we feel taken advantage of or overcharged in any way. Our quote did not change.  There weren't any hidden costs or fees.  In fact, we found that we were so on budget that we were able to splurge on our cabinet hardware and backsplash.

It has been nine months and we have not had a single issue with anything in our kitchen.  It is still beautiful, it still looks new and it is very, very user friendly.  This is a kitchen used and abused by children but appreciated by adults. 

We couldn't be happier and will use SOD again in the near future."
5,"Professional, clean, knowledgable and punctual. They finished building our new roof before a week was over and did not leave a mess! 

I'd definitely hire them again."
4,"I sent an urgent request to SOD builder to get a bid for my bathrooms and garage remodeling project due to the water damage at home. SOD customer service was really nice. After I canceled my first appointment, they were able to schedule a project manager to visit my place according to my time. The project Manager was helpful and professional. We got the estimates within 3 days."
5,"I had a guest bathroom remodel job and met with approximately four contractors. SOD Builders came in with a cost that was within our budget. We broke the job up into two stages, the first was a demo of a 3x3 shower and build a walk in tile shower that can accommodate ageing parents with a grab bar, shower bar, soap shelf and seat. New tile was laid and our new shower was a nice combo of large tile, glass tile mosaic and stainless steel appointments and a seat. Oren and his crew took about two weeks for the complete job which also included installing a shower light fan combo, paint and trim. The second portion of the rebuild was the installation of a new vanity and placing tile where the old vanity once stood. This vanity was not made for a corner and SOD builders took the marble splash guard and matched it to another piece to create a corner vanity unit. We are very pleased with the work performed and the crew that worked on this job. We would highly recommend SOD builders for your construction / remodel jobs."

Completely remodeled the kitchen, updated 2 bathrooms, completely remodeled the master bathroom, relocated the laundry room, installed attic insulation, replaced all windows and interior/exterior doors, and installed wood flooring.

Details:
Oren and Michal, his designer, were fantastic to work with.  Oren and Michal both met with us to walk through our home and understand the project we wanted to do.  Oren's bid was competitive, but the biggest reason we decided to hire him is because we could see how passionate he is about his work and we felt that Michal's vision was a perfect match for the look and feel we were going for.

Michal was very helpful in the planning phase and helped design our kitchen layout and cabinets, as well as our master bathroom.  She was also extremely helpful when it came time to start picking finishes.  She totally understood our style and helped us narrow down design options.  In addition, she was not afraid to let us know when she felt that we may be making choices that we could regret.  We greatly valued her opinions and support!

We had bought an older home that needed a lot of updating and improvement, so the job was quite big.  Luckily, we were not living in the home during the remodel.  However, we stopped by to check the progress at least a couple of times per week and were always impressed that the workers cleaned up after themselves each day and stored their tools even though they knew we weren't living there.  Whenever we did see the workers, they were always pleasant and courteous.  

About mid-way through the project, Oren's foreman leading up our project left the company.  This caused some delays, but the new foreman, Hector, was even better than the first and did everything he could to help make up for lost time.  We had told Oren from the beginning that he could take his time because we weren't in any hurry to move in (we were living at my father's house so that I could take care of him until he passed away from cancer).  The project was completed about 2 months behind schedule, but we had added some work to the original scope and wanted Oren to take his time to make sure everything was done exactly how we wanted it.  

We have now lived in our home for about 3 months.  After we moved in we began to notice certain issues and defects and kept a running list of items to be fixed.  Oren sent his crew back out about a month ago and fixed everything on our list with great attention to detail.  We could not be any happier with our ""new"" (old) home!

We have worked with other contractors on smaller projects at our previous homes before and they always quoted us much lower, but the final bill was much higher and the quality of the work was lacking.  We paid Oren exactly what he originally quoted us and are very happy with the results.  We would highly recommend Oren for his professionalism, attention to detail, and passion for his work.  He is an honest person and demands the same level of honesty and quality from his crew."
5,"I was impressed by SOD Builders commitment to satisfaction. We had lots of small details that we wanted to do right and Oren was absolutely willing to get all the little things done properly, and without a charge. The most impressive thing was that we agreed on a price at the start and Oren stuck to it even when it would cost him extra money to get right.

They did also a very good job of keeping my place clean, keeping things running while doing construction, and overall being very responsible and with a great regard to quality!"
5,"SOD Builders is a one-stop shop to my dream house.  With a complete team of project manager, designer, architect, licensed plumber/electrician, tile/floor specialists, painters, carpenters... they can put together pretty much any requests that you may dream up for your projects.  They did a gut renovation for me on an entire floor including demolishing and rebuilding a kitchen and 2 bathrooms, removing popcorn ceiling and smoothing out textured walls, updating all plumbing and electrical and putting in new hardwood floor.  SOD Builders provided high-quality work, expert advice and top-notch customer services.  The one thing the owner, Oren, said to me most often during the project was “whatever makes you happy, we’ll do it!” and they do!  They are very flexible to unexpected changes and always accommodating to the needs of the customers.  I picked out all the floors and tiles I wanted, and the project manager, Adi, helped me looked all over California to find the best prices for the materials.  When a part of the fireplace didn’t turn out looking like the design I had in mind, they immediately sent a team to rebuild the area to change it to look exactly like what I wanted.  For the bathrooms, we decided to put up tiles on all walls, we originally thought since all the walls were also newly built, installing the cement boards under the tiles would be sufficient enough, but Oren insisted on using the floating cement because he believes the method makes the bathrooms much more durable and provides better quality even though it was more costly to him and took longer to build.  There were many examples like these throughout the project.  I would highly recommend SOD Builders to anyone."
5,"Services Provided: 
Combined a kitchen area with a breakfast area, pushed out an exterior wall, enlarged the opening between the kitchen and dinning room, gutted the entire area, redesigned the ceiling in a pyramid fashion to solve the problem that the breakfast area had a vaulted ceiling, installed two new large windows then built an unbelievably beautiful, entirely functional high end kitchen.  We were so pleased with the work we had SOD remodel two bathrooms, a laundry room and install new linen cabinets in a hallway.  They also installed a beautiful large garden window in the dinning room.
Comments: 
If you are looking for an honest contractor who can make your most ambitious dreams come true, look no further than SOD Builders.  I alrey had my own idea (I even had my own drawings) of how my new kitchen should look.  I interviewed several highly rated contractors but I selected SOD for several reasons.  I met with the Project Manager, the Head Carpenter and Oren Dragan, the owner, all of whom seemed completely confident that they could meet my every expectation.  SOD did not give me the lowest bid I received, nor was it the highest but I was impressed by the fact that all of the major trades people were employed directly by Oren.  That meant that they were hand selected by and responsible directly to him.  It also meant that scheduling the various trades would be easier.  It turned out that all of the tradesmen (Carpenters, Plumbers, Electricians, Cabinet Makers, Tile Installers, Painters, etc.) were highly skilled, professional and hard working individuals who worked together like a well-honed team.  While the basic plan was mine, the end result was more than I could have imagined due to the experienced and creative input of Oren's team.  Joe, the Head Carpenter, came up with the idea of the tiered ceiling to beautifully unite the kitchen ceiling with the breakfast area ceiling which was vaulted.  He even took the time to build a model of his idea out of a cardboard box to give us a visual of his concept.  I could not ever improve on Golan's, the Cabinet Maker's designs for the cabinets.  Every drawer and cabinet were perfectly placed and completely functional. All the drawer open to the full extent.  All of the drawers and cabinet door have soft-close hinges.  The corner cabinet has a lazy susan.  There are slide-outs under the sinks and in the pantries.  Best of all, all of the pots and pans fit in drawers.  The large flat screen TV in the kitchen looks like it is part of the cabinetry.  The quality of the wood and the workmanship could not have been better.  The same quality and devotion to perfection was true of carpenters, plumbers, electricians, tile installers, painters and countertop fabricators.  All of the workers arrived on time every day, worked hard all day long (no goofing off) and cleaned up the area every day before they left.  This project passed all inspections with flying colors.  Oren Dragan made sure that every detail was completed to perfection.  I definitely would use SOD Builders again and I will highly recommend the Company to my friends and neighbors.  It was a no-hassle pleasure to work with Oren and his team."
5,"We first heard of SOD through another review company.  They had the highest review rate and highest score.  So, we gave them a call.  

My wife and I had a very good idea of what we wanted and how much we were willing to spend.  I had originally built this bathroom (and addition) so I had a base knowledge in construction.  When SOD arrived they were very professional and respectful and came with a slew of referrals..  They listened to our ideas and then offered modifications to enhance our vision.  We were very happy with all their changes to our initial design and even more delighted in that most of these opinions actually lowered our costs.  Their offer was many thousands below the nearest competitor and their ideas were superior to any views we had previously heard.  Their time frame was 3 weeks from start of demo to final inspection.

It was several weeks before they began but once they started, they moved quickly and efficiently.  They took great care to cover and isolate the house from their work area.  Demo occurred with the workers transiting the house in a plastic ""tunnel"" so as not to scatter dust and debris.  All materials were quickly hauled off site.  Each phase progressed similarly with the workers taking great care of the non-involved portion of the house before they began work on the bathroom.  I must give credit to Hector (the foreman) for providing a seamless transition from one phase to the next and being on site to take care of each question or request we had.  He was very quick to rectify or resolve any ""problem"" we had.  Another lido needs to go to SOD's tile man.  His work is superb.  When my wife was unable to visualize the new ceramic floor, he painstakingly arranged the floor in each of 3 patterns so she could choose which one best fit her initial vision.  Once decided, he applied the tiles (floor, shower walls and shower floors) to perfection.  The SOD plumber did a very good job of removing an existing water heater (left in place during the demo) and installing the new tankless one without leaving us hot waterless for more than an hour.  A very good feat!   SOD would have finished under 3 weeks but we opted to use a granite provider from whom we were able to procure a pice of fusion granite.  That change forced SOD to hold off on 4 days of work but they neither complained or asked for a change order.  

I am able to give SOD Builders the highest rating due to their work ethics, abilities and final product.  I have all ready referred them to 2 of my friends who are having work done to their homes.  You wont go wrong using this company. 

(this review has also been posted on another referral site by me, the homeowner)

5,"It was a pleasure working with SOD Builders from start to finish! Oren and Michelle came to our house and the end result is way beyond our expectations, WE LOVE OUR NEW HOME!
Oren & Michelle, were the third estimate that we received, they were not the lowest bid but they were very competitive they offered a new design and layout that no other company had thought of, I guess that’s a big difference when you have an in house designer (and no it does not effect on pricing, we had other companies that came and gave higher bid with no designer included). The new layout is great they were able to open up the space in our living room to the kitchen, my house looks like a picture in a fancy magazine, and it is very efficient when it comes to the use of the space.
The kitchen is just stunning and I’m so happy I can show off when I have friends over. When we bought the house the space was divided and it had a feeling of old and small and not so friendly.
The working process was very easy, I was always informed; the crew was always friendly and professional. When question and issues arise Oren and Michelle were available through there system very promptly, and I always had the feeling that there will be no compromising on the quality of work nor my satisfaction.
At the end, we are very happy with SOD builders, now I’m trying to convince my husband on remodeling our master bathroom; it has to match my new modern living space J will keep you posted.
SOD Builders it was great, thank you!"
5,"I had a great experience with SOD Builders. They ended up doing several projects for me, remodeling my master bath and my kitchen as well as retiling my front entry way and adding lighting to my living room. They seemed to work efficiently and completed the projects in a timely manner. 
  I am quite happy with the quality of their work as well as they way they seem to stand by it. Working with SOD was a really positive experience for me. And even though my house is almost 40 years old I’ve been told by more then one person the kitchen looks like a model home and the changes I’ve made have let the house come alive again. I would absolutely work with SOD builders again."
5,"SOD Builders has done a great job with our massive construction project.  The built us a new structure (garage/guesthouse) and now we are in the process of renovating our yard.  They have built a fence, laid flagstone, and are currently building a veranda.  They do great work for a fair price!"
5,"We had to replace a a bathroom ceiling light/heat/fan in our condo with no attic and had ""hole"" left in the ceiling after the electrician completed their job.  Had three companies quote on this job to drywall and repaint our entire bathroom a long with repairing the ""peeling"" areas around the tile and re-grouting our entire tub area.
SOD Builders was the highest cost, but carried all the insurance, including workman's comp and was very professional...and  at the end of the day---you get what you pay for!  The work that they did was outstanding - the drywall work that they did on our ceiling is like ""art""...you would never even know that it had been cut open.  They took care of all the details and made sure that we were VERY happy and they did what they said they would do - they got the entire job done within two days where everyone one else was quoting at least five days and with multiple vendor partners...?  Would recommend this company and will use them again!  Thank you SOD Builders for taking on this small project"
5,"SOD Builders painted the outside of our house and replaced damaged  patio deck around our pool. 

We were very pleased with the end results of both jobs and would recommend SOD Builders."
5,"SOD Builders re-did our Master Bathroom recently. They had a window of about 6 weeks to tear out the old bathroom and replace it with everything new, including new plumbing, electrical, carpentry, tiles, shower, basin, granite counter top, toilet, heated floor, etc. We had some idea as to what we wanted for our bathroom, but, didn't really didn't know how to put them all together. SOD Builders accommodated us, on occassion having to redo work because we thought it would look better some other way. Their Foreman Joe's favorite response to all of our requests was, ""not a problem, just let us know what you want"". Oren, the owner, believes that the Customer's satisfaction is so important that he is willing to have his workers do whatever is necessary to satisfy his customers. They did all the work, passed all the inspections, completed the work in 6 weeks, to our satisfaction. One thing, to us, ""after sales service"" is very important. How responsive is SOD Builders to a ""call back"" to refinish grouting because of shifting cracks, etc. Oren told us to not hesitate to call them back. I'm sure this will not be an issue for us."
5,"Love Oren's work. He was very professional throught the entire work. I had a wall removed that divided kitchen from living room. he came rightaway and gave me a quote, he explained the details of the work and possible complications. he also gave me an estimated time to finish, which he kept. Love his work, right away he sent, engineers, got city permits and started demolition. his workers were friendly and were ontime eveday, clean after their work each and everyday, protected my furniture from dust. at the end there was several complication that occur. most of which he had worn me about, and he went ahead and took care of them at no extra charge. will definetelly use their service again. top rated on angies list too."
5,"I hired SOD Builders to remodel our bathroom. The entire crew was extremely courteous, professional and thoughtful. 
Since we had to move out of our house during this time, they accommodated our needs and were flexible and understanding. The workmenship was first class and the service they provided was above and beyond. What I appreciated the most was that I was communicated on a daily basis what was going to happen and where we were with the progress.
I will utiilze them for kitchen project in the future. Thank you SOD team."
5,"We hired SOD to remodel our bathroom.  We interviewed three different contractors, and we went with Oren.   He and his workers did a great job--a very reasonable cost, and they were all very respectful and professional.  More than anything, I found that Oren was a trustworthy person, as he never tried to pull anything or do anything that I had questions about.   The project came off better than I had envisioned, and for the total cost that he had first estimated.  When we are ready to do another remodeling job, we will be sure to use Oren and SOD Builders."
5,"I own a company that deals with real estate investments.
We are using SOD Builders, INC services very often.
In the last 3 years we used them for several construction projects that involve a complete renovation of a house and other maintenance works for our apartment buildings. they are located conveniently in Tarzana.
I must say that they never let me down. Always on time, very professional and courteous, Fast and efficient.
Overall I have to say when I see them work I get to appreciate what they do. It is a hard work.
I will definitely continue using them and also recommend to friends and family."
5,Replaced our roof and completed remodeling projects because of longtime water damage. The projects were completed on time and on budget. The workmanship was excellent. SOD was truly professional and honest regarding all aspects of our projects. I would highly recommend this company.
5,"EXCELLENT.  From start to finish Oren was a pleasure to work with and his crew was always polite and punctual and absolutely 
cleaned up after themselves each and every day.  My neighbors had no idea we were doing such an extensive job in our yard
We would highly recommended SOD Builders if you are looking for any type of job and we are actually in talks right now about moving inside to start the interior.."
5,"I have an AMAZING bathroom thanks to SOD, Oren, the owner is a sweetheart, his guys were great especially Joe and his beautiful blue eyes!   Joe helped put it all together, kept everyone in check.  The Tile guy Jaime is an artist and matched every seam, framed the shower shampoo boxes as if they were a picture.  The Plumber William was excellent.  Oren delivered everything he promised.  

I highly recommend Oren and SOD Builders, I will be using them again when I renovate my other two bathrooms and kitchen which I hope will be soon."
5,"Our old, disgusting kitchen was in desperate need of a remodel.  We wanted everything replaced as well as two of the walls removed so that the kitchen would be more open to the rest of the house.  

Oren and his team were great from the beginning.  He gave us his initial quote and a completion date before he started and he stuck to both the entire time.  Naturally, lots of issues/fixes appeared during the remodel (since we went down to studs and it's an old house), but Oren always took care of everything and never charged us more.  His guys did an incredible job gutting the kitchen, replacing the floor, cabinets, fixtures, appliances, painting, tiling, rewiring, building a new pantry, removing the old walls, installing new support beams, everything.  His crew changed often, but everybody was friendly and cleaned up as best they could at the end of each day.  

There were a few things that needed to be done more than once since Oren was not present every day to supervise  (we had a countertop installed wrong, some crooked outlets, etc.).  That said, Oren ALWAYS immediately fixed the problem at no cost to me as soon as possible (and nothing delayed the completion date we were originally given.)  Speaking of -- Oren was always available through email (he uses Basecamp), phone, texting, etc.  We never waited more than an hour for a response to our question or concern.

In addition, we liked Oren and his team so much we also had them replace our galvanized plumbing under the house and our electrical panel.  Both were his suggestion, but the decision was left to us, and we never felt pressured.

All in all, I think the pictures speak for themselves.  Our kitchen was dated and unappealing and SOD turned it into our dream kitchen at the initial price they promised and by the time they promised it by.  Oren was always easy to work with, his guys were friendly, and we couldn't be happier with the finished result.  We definitely plan to use SOD Builders again."
5,"Oren & Gil from SOD did a complete remodel of our kitchen. We purchased appliances, but they did everything else; gutted the existing kitchen and floor, installed brand new electrical, plumbing, floor, walls and even removed a load-bearing wall to open up the kitchen to the den. They took care of all of the permits, inspections, & fees. Member Comments: We interviewed 7 contractors, four from word of mouth and  three through Angie's list. One by one they came through and spoke with us about cost, design, how they operated and timelines. Each one either had their own idea of how they would do it, or was way to high in price, or just indifferent, but when SOD Builders, Ore & Gil stopped by they made us feel very comfortable, they helped us see our vision. They started right away with demo and worked quickly, they seem to be very well organized and since they have their own electricians, carpenters and plumbers on staff, there was no waiting for the sub-contractor to stop by.
They had a cabinet company and tile folks that we worked with to pick out new cabinets, floor tile and back splash, as well as sink, faucets, even a pasta or pot-filler over the stove. They made it very care-free and they took care of every detail and didn't charge for minor change orders. When we asked about the load bearing wall, they were unsure until their engineer came to visit, so they even gave us an estimate on the cost, in advance, just in case we did need to do the extra work and knowing the price upfront gave us piece of mind. In fact when we did have to do the extra work, they stuck to their quote. 
What I really love about working with SOD Builders was their positive attitude and a willingness to make us happy and to stick with their original quote and NO SURPRISES. 
We really enjoyed working with SOD and we are already getting quotes for a patio renovation."
5,"First and foremost, our kitchen looks amazing!  Every time we now step into it, we’re validated that we made all the right decisions.     

We recently purchased our first home which had an outdated kitchen and a backyard patio in need of improvement so we called S.O.D. for a kitchen remodel and enclosed patio estimate.  Upon first meeting Oren, it’s clear that one word to describe him as is Confident.  Confident in his abilities, confident he would come in on budget, and confident we would be happy with S.O.D. in the end.  And he was right.  They weren’t the cheapest estimate but we can’t imagine the quality we received at any lower price.  Plus, the unexpected perks we received (a new linen closet, extending our wall in our laundry area) more than made up for a slightly higher total price.  Also, they were able to come down in price for the covered patio (which also turned out great!) in order to match a competitor’s price and stay within our budget.  

The whole process took about a month and a half (they were kicked out for a week because we had our floors refinished) which was very close to their original time estimate.  They also kept the arduous city-inspector process as smooth as possible and Oren was always accessible by text, phone or email (even meeting with us on Sundays) and he always gave updates throughout the remodel.  

Overall, it was a positive experience with a great result.  We would definitely recommend to anyone looking to remodel."
5,"I have SOD Builders did a remodel to our two bathrooms at the end of 2010. I had good experience with the team. Compared to other two contractors I hired for other remodeling for my home 3 years ago, SOD Builders were much more responsible. They responded promptly, stick to the budget as well. As a designer myself, I think they are very professional and knew the code very well. And I was satisfied with the work they did. I would be glad to recommend them to others."
5,"I cannot recommend these guys enough. Seriously, my family was in the middle of a mold crisis. Twice in two years. The first time someone recommended that I contact Oren and I did. Boy was I glad I did. He came out RIGHT away, helped me and my young kids, took care of everything, figured out what the real problem was (which honestly no one else had been able to do til that point), and then completely saved us. He totally treated us like we were his own family. Responsive, quick, efficient, kind. Knew what he was doing. Had awesome guys working for him that we totally trusted. When we found ourselves needing more help (for different reasons)  the next year, I knew who to call. and again he swooped in and saved us. SERIOUSLY, CALL HIM. His prices were beyond fair, and I really came to just totally depend on him. I am so glad someone referred him to us, and am happy to forward the favor. He really made us feel safe and important and not gouged and did everything he said he would. and did it well. quickly. what more can you ask for??

btw, let me add that i have referred oren to many many people now and they have all been super happy. seriously, he is a gem. LOOK NO FURTHER."
5,"SOD Builders did a complete home renovation for us (new kitchen, new laundry room, new floors and carpets, interior & exterior paint, electrical re-wire, plumbing, new doors, the works). The end product is beautiful, well-constructed, and they were a pleasure to work with. Very professional, very responsive and trustworthy. We look forward to working with them in the future!"
1,"I hired this company and pd $1500 for design work for my backyard. The returned work was deplorable, and the company even admitted that they were having a hard time keeping designers and they had to push it out to a 3rd party. After numerous calls and emails (which weren’t returned) I decided to write this off to good advertising on a sports radio show."
5,"After reviewing and researching multiple landscape companies, my wife and I reached out to Outdoor Makeovers to do a complete gut of our backyard, and when I say gut, I mean a complete demolition.   Navid came out and reviewed our ideas and the current state of our backyard.  He provided better alternatives in design and flow, which we had not initially considered.   We were very pleased and impressed with his design and knowledge and decided to move forward with the project.   

The scope of our project included complete demolition, two patios (one raised) with a fire pit, new sod, mulch and a build out for a hot tub.  Navid provided video updates throughout the project, which, in total, was completed in less than two weeks.  For the size and scope of our project, we were very impressed and almost in shock of how quickly it all came together.  That just goes to show you the dedication of his team.  We were very pleased with the final design and how it came to life with the complete makeover that his team delivered on.  We initially held off writing this review to give time for things to settle.  That said, COVID set in and it actually allowed us to enjoy our new time in the backyard even more than we initially expected. 

Recently, we reengaged with Navid to address a minor issue with how a section of one of the patio’s pavers had settled.  His team came back out and within the day completely remediated the issue.  This goes to show that Outdoor Makeovers stands behind their craftsmanship and reaffirms the reason why we selected this company for our “little” paradise in our backyard.

1,"After reading reviews, not surprised I saw a couple others where they took consult fees under false pretenses. Saw the same on another site so again how are they getting such great reviews?? Whether $35 or $250, deliberately taking customers consult fee is plain dishonest. I lost my consult fee also, with no services or usable advice given. They appeared to lose interest in giving a good consult when I informed them I was getting other quotes. I am sure consult fees are part of how they make money.The amount of excellent 5 star reviews look very suspicious especially since this was mentioned by the rep several times and the ideas were very standard and similar to other vendors. Not hard to create great fake reviews for your company.

Most importantly, the quote was also so high it was ridiculous! There are much more affordable companies out there who do great work. Shop around."
5,"Navid and his teams were outstanding. From day one Outdoor Makeover & Living Spaces displayed exceptional creativity and project management. We had a few ideas on what we wanted to do with our front and back yards, but Navid and his team took what we wanted to another level. Not only did their final product greatly exceed our expectations, but they also turned it around quicker than first planned. Our yard now has a ""wow"" factor to it - my family and I now love to be in our backyard! Yes, we spent a lot of money - but the quality of work and material used was 100% worth it. Every member of the team worked hard and took great pride in their work - and it showed. Thank you Navid and crews!!"
5,"This is our 2nd project with the outdoor team. Our first project was in October 2019 and we reached out to start our 2nd project in May 2020. Working in phases helped us to stay in budget and was a great decision for us. The Outdoor team had our phase 2 patio and covered pergola done by July 1. (Cost for phase 2 was $39,000) So about 6 weeks to complete our incredible project. My favorite thing about the Outdoor crew is that every one of their workers does high quality work. They truly treat your project as if they were working on their own yard. Although this is an outdoor space it feels like we gained more living square footage on our house. Functional, comfortable, and attractive, it was a great way to enhance our home’s value."
5,"This is the second time we've worked with Navid and Outdoor Makeover, and once again we were thrilled with our choice! This latest project involved two retaining walls, a complete regrading of the backyard and added drainage, new walkways and trees. It was a total transformation that is both functional and beautiful, and we're so grateful to Navid and his team (especially Eddie and Sam) for taking such good care of it. They were responsive, respectful, and incredibly thorough. They also made sure our neighbor was completely happy because the retaining wall replacement involved removing and replacing some of her fence. While the quote might come in a bit higher than some other places, you absolutely get what you pay for in terms of the materials, quality of the work, and customer service. We can't recommend Navid and his team at Outdoor Makeover enough!"
5,"Navid and his crew at Outdoor Makeover just completed our big backyard landscaping project which involved moving a lot of dirt, taking out trees and replanting new ones and building multiple retaining walls. From the onset Navid provided great input on how to design our yard and gave realistic advise on how to save costs. Our yard turned out great and far surpassed our expectations."
5,I just had Outdoor Makeover put in a patio.  These guys are the best.  First they help you to design your space with helpful ideas that help you to end up with a finished project better then you expected.  They show up on time and clean up at the end of each day.  True turnkey job.
5,"My backyard looks amazing the Outdoor Makeover & Living Spaces crew is very dedicated and definitely worked very very hard. It is unbelievable that the work was actually completed in 2 days. The communication between Navid, Brian, his foreman and the crew was excellent. 
A minor issue was quickly corrected to my satisfaction. The price was reasonable (not cheap), but the money is well-worth it. My only criticism would be the time between hiring and beginning of the work. With that stated, we did hire Outdoor Makeover & Living Spaces in the midst of the COVID pandemic, when most people were working on landscaping and property renovation. We would definitely hire the team for future projects"
5,"Navid and team are great to work with! They are professional, thorough, and on-time. We had them redo our front yard and walkway, which turn out beautiful. This is our second project with the team and we would recommend them again and again."
5,"Great experience! We met with Navid for the initial consultation. He was very thorough and gave us ideas for the backyard we never considered. The consultation was well worth the cost, and because he helped in the design process, the finished product was much better than I initially expected. The initial design was a bit more expensive than we were willing to pay so Navid worked with us to get the design within our budget.  We actually settled on a design a bit below our budget, and he advised us to budget an extra X% for unknowns that could happen while under construction. That was really helpful because as the project progressed, there were a few additions and changes that really helped make the finished product better than expected. Once the project began, Navid stayed connected and I saw him regularly. When the crews arrived without Navid, each of the different leads he assigned for demolition (Ivan), construction (Gerardo) , and the landscape (Giovanni), had intimate knowledge of"
5,"After reading several outstanding reviews, we contacted Outdoor Makeover to seek help in transforming our wooded backyard into a landscape that we could use and enjoy.  From the moment we contacted them (initially speaking with Tina), we realized and experienced their wonderful customer service – very friendly and client-centered.  This was perhaps the most important quality we were seeking in working with a landscape company, and Outdoor Makeover excelled in this area from beginning to end.  We experienced the professionalism and workmanship of Outdoor Makeover as second to none.  We recommend Outdoor Makeover without reservation (and would gladly give them more than 5 stars!), and are grateful to have worked with the Outdoor Makeover team and experience their fantastic customer service and work."
5,"We had a wonderful experience with KraftMaster Renovations!  The entire team were fantastic to work with.  We enjoyed having 24/7 access to the team and all job information via their platform.  Everyone on the team was attentive, friendly, professional and talented at their job.  Having our kitchen renovated, Carly designed a great plan and Chris the project manager was there with us every step of the way and always popped by if we needed him.  We work mostly from home and found it to be a smooth process for the job to take place during our work hours.  We never felt out of the loop, or waiting for answers.  If there were even the smallest touch ups or changes, they would return asap and handle.  Shout out to Steve, Nick & Robbie - great job guys.  Plus Chris and the electrician team!  Highly recommended."
5,"It is without hesitation that I provide a recommendation for KraftMaster Renovations (KraftMaster) and their team.  KraftMaster exceeded our expectation at every stage, and delivered on-time.  Over the entire length of the project, KraftMaster met each weekly deliverable, and it was clear what the next steps were.  KraftMaster’s lead designer, Maureen, was incredible to work with.  She is a great listener and picked up exactly what we were looking for – an open space with the ability to close off certain areas for privacy.  The transformation of the space is beyond words.   I remember at our initial meeting, Maureen commented that we had plenty of room to meet our needs, I was skeptical, but she definitely proved me wrong.  
Alexandra was simply amazing at sourcing things and being very practical.  We were looking for a set of custom glass sliders which were well beyond what we budgeted for, however, she was able to find a much more reasonable set of glass sliders which gave the aesthetic of exactly what we were looking for.   We loved all the trades that were involved in our project.  Each one of them were very professional and it was evident that they each took a lot of pride in doing the work carefully and going above and beyond to deliver.  At the project outset, Bob had a team meeting with all the trades to go through the project, open up a few walls to determine if there were any issues at the beginning.  At this point, we were introduced to our project manager, Chris.  Chris was always reachable and very responsive.  He was great at problem solving, and made a great suggestion about tile we had chosen to go around the fireplace.   The job site was cleaned up every day, and all trades were great at answering all my questions.  Our carpenter team consistently mostly of Peter and Walter.  Not only are they both incredible at their work, both of them were so pleasant to be around.  I enjoyed my daily chats with both of them.   I was very impressed with how they hung our fireplace mantle, which consisted of a reclaimed solid piece of barnwood which probably weighed close to 600 lbs.  The plumbers were great.  Moon, Danny & Mike are very good at what they do.  They even diagnosed that our plumbing lines in our laundry room were crossed for the washing machine so when we thought we were using cold water, we were in fact using hot water.  I was impressed with their work ethic that if they found something that wasn’t right, they were going to address it.  The electricians also went above and beyond.  The team consisted of Chris, Nick and Renan.  Their work was incredibly neat, it was evident that they took no short cuts in running lines back to the main junction box.  The tiling expert, Bogden, is a true artisan.  He would spend hours laying out the tiles first before he cut anything to ensure everything lined up perfectly.  

KraftMaster transformed our space to our needs, and we thoroughly enjoy it every day."
5,"Kraftmaster crated a beautiful bathroom for us from a connected room to our master bedroom. The room and the side of the house it was on had no plumbing but the Moon, Danny, and Mike did a great job analyzing how to best get pipes to the room. Krftmaster provides a full service construction service and it starts with interviews and then design. Carly listed to what we wanted out of the renovation and then provided us with 3 different designs with different budgets to choose from. We then went shopping together to work together to pick out the tiles, counter materials, sinks, toilets, fixtures, etc. They have lots of knowledge around these things and can answer any question.

As the project commenced it was great to see a project plan we had access to and could communicate with the team. Chris was our project manager and Steve was our go-to for whatever it was that was needed at a moments notice. The project started on-time and during a difficult time of year when we had multiple snowstorms that made roads underivable and many areas with power outages. This affected the schedule a bit but delays were communicated and justified and they weren't that long.

The carpenters and electricians did great work (Chris, Nick, and Renan are precise electricians - every screw on the switch plates is aligned up-and-down which just shows you their attention to detail) and the tile work was amazing. Bogdan is an incredibly skilled and throughout tile-person and spent considerable time on the mud job and tile work. Super precise.

What was great was that near the end of the job we weren't 100% happy with the alignment of a towl-rack (we made some changes to plans during construction and the carpenter who installed it didn't see the update, it happens) and I pointed it out to Chris who agreed it should be fixed. It wasn't an easy fix as the tiles had to be broken off and replaced the the bar realigned, but they did it and it promptly. 

The end result is a perfect bathroom that suits the home.

I'm already planning a second project with Kraftmaster."
5,"Where can I begin!  This whole process has been organized, trustworthy, smooth and remarkable! Using KraftMaster for our recent master bathroom renovation was the best decision we've made and we know exactly who to call for the next project!  We are now enjoying the bathroom we have always wanted!!!

We have a 1928 Tudor-style house, so it was important to make updates that reflect the style of this house.  Carly and Bob took their time with us at the beginning as we carefully figured out how to achieve a spacious master bathroom with a tub, shower, double sink vanity, and walk-in closet.  This was a HUGE project as we went into a spare room to create a master walk-in closet. They were very creative and mindful of our budget and allowed us to make decisions that we were comfortable with. Carly held my hand with the designs from start to finish in a way that was fun and supportive- she's amazing.  Nick, Robbie, and Carlos made the project come to life and I am so grateful for them! When the job was finished I missed seeing them. The plumbing crew- Moon, Danny, and Mike do such great work we have called them back to help us out with other issues that have come up. Steve, Chris, and Alexandra round out this awesome team with friendly service and work ethic that is hard to come by these days.

I am so grateful that Bob and his team took on this HUGE project and gave us the bathroom of our dreams!  It truly is a showstopper!  Thanks, KraftMaster! You will be hearing from us sooner than you think :)"
5,"We contracted with KraftMaster Renovations in 2020 to renovate our 1960's kitchen.  We couldn't have made a better choice.  The entire process was almost flawless.  Carly, our designer, immediately understood our style and goals, guiding us through the selection of materials.  Chris, our project manager, and Alexandra, our project coordinator, kept the schedule running perfectly with minimal delays, in spite of Covid.
Carpenters, Peter and Walter, plumbers, Danny, Moon and Mike, electricians, Chris, Ryan and Renan, all did an excellent job bringing the design to life.
We will certainly call Bob Gockeler and Kraftmaster for our next project."
5,"We were very pleased with the work of KraftMaster Renovations. We hired them for a second floor reconfiguration, redoing nearly 90 year old bathrooms and in turn slightly reconfiguring two bedrooms. They also helped us with installing HVAC in our home. From the day Bob and Julie walked into our home for a consultation, to the celebratory day they picked up the floor protection, their team treated our house and our family with great respect. They supported our desire to stay in keeping with the house, and as they noticed certain design features of our home, suggested we incorporate them into our renovations. For example, we have a lot of crown molding in our home and instead of ripping it off and throwing it away, they suggested they put it back after door frames were put back on. That is one example of their thoughtfulness and consideration during our renovations. 
Maureen helped us design beautiful space. Nick and his team, Moon and his team, and Chris and his team were kind and respectful, guided us well, clearly communicated what they were doing, and when it came up, what surprises we were faced with (only one major one!). Their work is impeccable, and we continually enjoy our home and new spaces. We highly recommend their work and do plan to use them for future projects."
5,"I have had the pleasure of working with Bob and Julie on two major projects.  One, a kitchen renovation and more recently, a whole house overhaul which included  gutting and updating a kitchen, three bathrooms, and redesigning some of the floor plan so it would work better for our family. 

 Kudos to Maureen who helped me achieve the modern farmhouse feel that we were hoping for.  She and her assistant Alexandra were  a pleasure to work with, patiently walking us through every decision we had to make and there were plenty!  

The construction crews starting with the demolition right on through to finish carpentry are a talented bunch, always friendly, respectful and doing their best to bring the project to life.  

I highly recommend Bob, Julie and their team for any renovation project you might have in mind!"
5,"From the moment we met with Bob, Julie, and Maureen through to completion they made us feel at ease. We had an idea of how we wanted our kitchen to look, but by partnering with Kraftmasters they were able to keep us focused on what was important while building the kitchen we've always wanted all on schedule. My wife and I constantly look back at our inspiration picture and are amazed by how similar it looks. 

A few reasons why Kraftmasters stands out from other home renovation companies:
- They do what they say
- They're transparent
- They care about their customers happiness

I would strongly recommend Kraftmasters to anyone tackling a home renovation project."
5,"KraftMaster was a wonderful design-build team to work with.  They handled the pandemic by always keeping us informed and working safely in our home.  They are hands down the cleanest contractors we have ever worked with, and they honestly treated our home as if it was their own.  We'd especially like to thank Carly, Chris, and Matt for helping us through every stage of the project and for being so accommodating and professional!  Our new bathroom is perfect and we couldn't imagine a better end result!"
5,"The bestest of all. Highly recommend this company. Very professional. Top class this Team has very experienced people when it comes to designing, estimating cost and building"
5,"TO BEGIN: Our Kitchen Remodel Is OUTSTANDING & VERY BEAUTIFUL! 

We have a 250 year old house & are very protective of her good & historically appropriate care. Our OLDE small kitchen needed careful modernizing & my husband & I were stumped as to what to do within our small space. 

I began visiting kitchen redesign/ house remodeling businesses to see who I might find. One fall day I stopped into KraftMaster Renovations store front & was met by 3 generations of the Gockeler family. I had no appointment, but they gave me time. They listened & gave me a rare sense of being in good hands & I'd only just met them. I went home & told my husband, “I think I've found the right people for our historic kitchen remodel.” Following our 1st meeting, my husband was fully on board. So we began. 

Design meetings with Bob Gockeler & Maureen Madigan began in our small kitchen. During that first meeting Bob & Maureen moved us to solutions we'd never considered & we were excited. As we worked the design they both took us into & through great buying choices, & great solutions due to good & creative problem solving -- we were a team. 

Demolition began late summer & we were essentially done in December. Every member of their team was TIP TOP & I ALWAYS felt comfortable when they were in our home. I experienced a rarely-felt-in-NJ courtesy from every member of their team & they always left the premises (inside & out) tidy & clean & everyone was a hard worker.

SPECIFICALLY: 
-I met Robbie Geckeler & Matt Carlson with their deliveries & on site work. They were, as I experienced with the entire team, so courteous, friendly & hard working. 
-The carpentry on our project was I believe uniquely challenging and their team was superb. Their Master Carpenter, Chris Stevens was superlative in his care, talent & skill as was his team: Lead Carpenter, Tyler Cornelissen & Apprentice, Cam Kennedy. 
-It was a pleasure to meet & work with Julie Geckeler who managed communications & scheduling. I really liked the online project management tool (CoConstruct). Meetings in their new office & showroom assisted our decisions. I shifted my countertop choice at one such visit, while perusing one of their lovely displays. 
-At the end of our project I met Alexandra Grosser & Bob’s daughter for the photo shoot, true professionals – ALL.  
-I want to cycle back to Bob Geckeler & Maureen Madigan to say Thank You! We couldn’t have done this without you! Your creativity, professionalism, kindness, & hard work were always present. And I must add FUN - This was a FUN PROJECT.

We thank your entire team & your entire family! Everyone who walks into our new kitchen for the first time gasps (literally) & says it’s SO Beautiful - Because it is. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!"
5,"A First Class Company that Exceeded Expectations!

Our family is thrilled with our recent kitchen remodel from KraftMaster Renovations.  Bob and his team transformed our kitchen from closed-off and dated, to the open, modern center of our home.  It has transformed the feel of the entire house.  It is something our family will enjoy and can be very proud of. 

Simply put, the team is world class – knowledgeable, relentlessly hardworking, talented, friendly, respectful, and clean. Kim’s design turned out to be a perfect combination of form and function with small, thoughtful details that add wonderful unique touches.  Her design was brought to life by Peter and Walter whose expert carpentry work served well to highlight the quality of the material, and Bobby whose meticulous and beautiful tilework has thus far received ""Wow"" comments from all that visit.  There were many others that we grew to know over the course of the project – from Robbie and Matt who were key to executing the logistics of the project, to Moon (plumbing) who on multiple occasions, made sure to work around our toddler who was at home on certain days.  

We’d be remiss not to mention Julie – who made certain that we were updated each step of the way.  She communicated nearly each day which kept us informed and comforted that the project was progressing towards a timely completion.   

We are fully satisfied and plan to be repeat customers.  They made certain that the remodel was exactly what we wanted – no detail was too small.  You won’t regret hiring Kraftmaster for your project."
5,"Bob and Team are great!!  I used KraftMaster for my large kitchen remodel project in Summer 2018.  The project took ~2.5 months.  While this company is not the cheapest quote they really do keep to their timeline and professionalism.  Many times contractors will lose interest or start another job and never finish.  Not KraftMaster and even towards the end of the project i never felt like i was a secondary thought to them.  They remained on schedule and finished on time!  They maintained good contact and updates throughout the project.  The main project managers, Peter and Walter, were so courteous and professional.  Would definitely recommend this firm to anyone in the area looking to do a large or small remodel."
5,"The 2 things that come to mind working with Kraftmaster are craftsmanship and professionalism. In the past I’ve worked with contractors that were really good in one of those areas but lacked in the other. 

The team was excellent to work with. Maureen is a true design talent. She took the time to get to know my wife and I to get a better understanding of the aesthetic we were looking for. She guided us through the big picture design comp process, down to the little fixture details. There were a couple of instances where it took some extra prodding on her part to get us to purchase detail that was out of our original scope and budget, but she has a way of explaining how the extra investment would enhance the overall look. Glad we took her advice.

Our lead contractor Chris was a true professional. He was pleasant to work with and highly skilled at the work. He came up with some creative solutions on a couple of items which were initially a concern for us. He made sure to address some of the call outs that I had throughout the build process. The final implementation was excellent.

Julie was very helpful answering questions and making sure information was relayed back to the team. 

Chris and the electrical team were great. Very responsive to some adjustments that needed to be made along the process. 

As the company owner I was pleasantly surprised how involved Bob was throughout. He didn’t sell the project and then disappear. He was communicative during the entire process. When we hit a roadblock on the project, Bob worked with me to find a solution. 

Overall a great time. I recommended them to some good friends who have also started a major remodel project with Kraftmaster."
5,"Bob and team were excellent from Day 1.  We decided to go with Bob's team because of his patience and his one stop shop team.  A large reno like ours can be very intimidating.  We also live in an HOA community, so there are additional rules and guidelines that Bob and team had to become familiar with.  The team had all sorts of excellent design ideas and helped us narrow things down when we got overwhelmed with choices.  The designer,  construction crew, electrician, and everyone else involved were personable, professional and trustworthy.  We love our new kitchen!"
5,"Bob and the KraftMaster team turned our house, built in 1903, into the home we always knew it could be.  The team really helps you through the project from beginning to end.  The design process went smoothly and logistical coordination was quite impressive.  Everything was always there on time and highly organized.  For our primary points of contact I'd like to specifically say a few words about:

Kim was a huge help as the designer for our project.  She took the rough ideas for our layout and flushed them out with better ideas and a smarter use of space.  Especially for our master bath and walk-in closet, which had an odd shaped room due to the dormer.  It was definitely the smartest way to layout the bathroom and optimized my wife's walk in closet.  

When it came to picking out countertops, tile, and fixtures... thank God we had Kim.  It would have taken us a dozen trips and several fights to get to the decisions we made in two.  Kim had great ideas, but also gave us the space we needed to make our own decisions.  It was a good balance.  

Kim was also very responsive to our daily communications and what seemed like a thousand Change Orders.  She was great at answering questions and allaying any concerns that we had.  Overall, Kim was a huge reason our project turned out so great.  

Nick is an amazing craftsman.  He is super knowledgeable with incredible attention to detail.  I really appreciated this.  Our house was built in 1903 and we wanted to match the detailed molding throughout the rest of the house.  I can only image the pain that was.  He was also great at dealing with and suggesting solutions to the ""charm"", aka problems, that these old houses present.  I really couldn't imagine the house turning out better.  It is a work of art.  

Did we hit small bumps in the road?  Sure, but every project does, and those bumps were taken care of quickly.  We are very happy with the project and look forward to spending many years in our home with our family creating memories."
5,"When we purchased our home, we knew that we wanted to renovate the kitchen and family room space to open it up and give it a better flow. We researched several local companies and settled on KraftMaster Renovations. We had an idea of what we were looking to do, but with the help of Bob, Kim, and their team, we were able to realize the dream of our perfect kitchen space. From start to finish, we were kept in the loop about timeline changes, new ideas, and everyone was responsive to our questions and changes. We are so happy with our new kitchen and highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations to anyone we know looking to renovate."
5,"We have worked with Bob and his team on multiple projects.  The first project was a transformative kitchen remodel where not only did the team reimagine the space in ways we would never have thought possible, the ideas they had for finishes and the final design exceeded all of our expectations.  Our latest project was a technical siding replacement of tongue and groove cedar in a 1978 architect designed home and the results again exceeded our expectations.  Bob's onsite crews are skilled and always professional.  Bob himself is incredibly experienced, very open to new ideas with amazing contacts and resources for the most unusual materials. Case in point, the glass backsplash behind the stove.  An original photo taken by my husband, transformed.   If you can imagine it, he can bring it to life!  He also has great rapport with local inspectors and townships which enables the smooth execution of  projects."
5,"When my wife and I decided to renovate our kitchen, bathroom and other parts of our house, we set out to find someone who could capture our style (which is a bit unorthodox), provide high quality craftsmanship and do so within our budget expectations.   KraftMaster Renovations absolutely delivered.  

As my wife and I started the process, we were fortunate that we share a common design aesthetic—sort of a fusion of Mid-Century Modern and European Modern.  We, however, were also aware that this style is not that common in Northern New Jersey.  As we met with other design and build companies, many struggled to grasp the design elements that we sought and often re-directed us to more traditional “lines,” cabinetry, fixtures and colors.  However, after meeting Bob and seeing his portfolio of work, we thought that KraftMaster Renovations would be able to capture the “look” we wanted.

Our confidence was absolutely rewarded.  Maureen, our designer at KraftMaster, did a perfect job fusing our ideas together into a cohesive design that not only is beautiful, but also practical in its layout and space optimization.  Maureen also displayed incredible patience with us (or with me, to be more precise) as we modified some of the original design work after demolition revealed some issues with the house.  

As our project moved into the construction phase, we were exceptionally impressed by the craftsmanship and attention to detail of all the tradesmen.  Nick, Carlos and Camilo, the primary carpenters, are perfectionists.  This is evident in their own work, as well as their expectations of products purchased for the project—rejecting cabinets, tiles, hardware that were not perfect.  Danny, the primary plumber, and Chris, the primary electrician, provided excellent work that was obviously done with care and pride.  

Throughout the entire process, Bob was always involved and always responsive.  Early in the project he proposed alternatives that could save us some money, or told us that certain items were unnecessary expenses.  As the project advanced, he helped provide some creative solutions to structural issues that surfaced during demolition.  As the project was winding down, Bob made sure that we were pleased with everything, and made sure that any final adjustments were done to our satisfaction.  

Based on our experience, we highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations due to its quality of work and level of service.  And if your design preferences are more modern than traditional, you should absolutely meet with KraftMaster Renovations before starting your renovation or remodeling project."
5,"Bob Gockeler, Maureen Madigan and the entire KraftMaster Renovations Team is setting the standard that all contractors and home remodel companies should strive for.  ACCOUNTABILITY/PROFESSIONALISM/DOING THE RIGHT THING/EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE/EXPERTISE & A COMMITMENT TO STICKING TO WHAT WAS AGREED UPON are some of the A+ qualities we received in working with the KraftMaster Team.  Not only are we in love with our full bathroom remodel but we know with complete certainty knowing that the work was completed correctly.  The design concept for the small space was something we could not have envisioned and the end result was even more gorgeous that what we anticipated. One of things that impressed us most is that the team stayed on schedule!!  When I share that fact with friends and family they are blown away. Day 1 of the project they arrived when expected and left as agreed upon through the end of the project.  This is how they were able to standby the time frame we had originally discussed.  We really enjoyed working with the team and look forward to working with them again."
5,"I  highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations.  The toughest part of my kitchen renovation (May/June 2016) was packing up 60+ years of my mom's, grandmother's and my appliances and dishes to make way for the KraftMaster guys to get to work. I moved back into my childhood home after my mom passed away a few years prior to the renovation and was happy I chose Bob, Maureen and their team to turn my mom's kitchen into my own.  In keeping with the style of the mid-century Cape, we expanded the kitchen's storage capacity and enhanced its cottage ambiance with Shaker-style cabinetry finished in Marshmallow Cream. Subtle wood grain porcelain plank floor tiles, a beautiful Cambria Quartz countertop highlighted by a Pumice subway tile backsplash carried my 1941 Cape into the 21st century without sacrificing its mid-century modern footprint and charm.  Everyone who's seen it, can't believe the transformation. From day one, the guys showed up every day to gut, install, tile, drywall and plaster. The exceptionally skilled tilers often stayed late to finish a job.  It was such a pleasure working with designer Maureen, Bob, son Robbie and their team, that I am planning to continue working with them on upcoming jobs as well."
5,I recently had my kitchen and bathroom renovated by KraftMaster.  I'm thrilled with the redo.  Working the Kim (the designer) and Bob was exactly what I was looking for - guidance on various ideas with best practices incorporated.  The work crew obviously care about their work as everything was done with top notch quality.  They were flexible by working around some unique challenges.  Everything was planned well and the work went along smoothly.  KraftMaster was exactly the type of contractor that I was looking for.  Thank you to the entire team.  I love my new spaces.
5,"Having never undergone a major renovation, we were very apprehensive about the entire kitchen renovation process.  However, we can't say enough about Bob Gockeler and his entire team.  Bob and Kim were extremely involved, responsive, and helpful in every aspect of the project, from the design stage, to picking out fixtures, to the final small details that we would never have even thought of. They were beyond patient with all of our questions and went above and beyond to ensure that we were happy and confident in the choices that  were made.  The Crew that worked on the kitchen were professionals in every sense of the word.  Their work was top quality, they were friendly, left the work area clean and were very easy to have around.  The final result was beyond what we had hoped for.  Our kitchen is beautiful!  We would highly recommend working with Kraftmaster Renovations."
1,"Last Fall, my wife and I met with Bob and Kim a few times and our experience was so poor that I want to come back to this, because the overwhelmingly positive reviews on Houzz simply do not capture the complete picture on their business.  Rather than go through a detailed blow by blow of our experience, I think it’s more valuable to Houzz users that I just get to the bottom line.  In our view, Bob is a charming guy who markets a “design/build” offering in which customers end up over paying for the product they end up getting.  An argument could be made that you’re paying to have one stop shop and your hand held.  Having said that, the proposal we got from Bob was so generalized in terms of the design detail, that it was just not useful; if you want a high end product, when it comes to cabinetry and carpentry, it is ALL about the details.  So we decided to go shop.  Immediately, two things became clear.  One, most kitchen design specialists understand that you have to get very detailed in the design, unless you want a fairly pedestrian product.  Two, we would be able to get a much better quality cabinet/finish/overall product/project for, roughly speaking, 20 percent less than what was quoted by Bob.  Now that our project is 97% done, I can tell you by experience, that this is exactly what we achieved…we got a vastly better overall end product for substantially less money…"
5,"Bob, you may not realize this about me, but I am a perfectionist/interior design junkie.  Having been called on one or two occasions by people close to me that “I am a control freak”! (which I do take as a compliment)!!  Details, details, details, it’s my mantra – focusing on how I can manage the “what if’s” in any situation.  It gives me great comfort knowing my actions can affect the outcomes to situations I have control for.  So you can only imagine the amount of TRUST and CONFIDENCE I placed in you and your team!  After doing my due diligence research to assure I was going to get exactly what I had hoped and dreamed for (which happened to be 10 years in the making) – I was placing  “No pressure” on you -- right!!  Well, I can wholeheartedly state – You completely exceeded my expectations!! I feel like I am in a design magazine, every time I enter my kitchen.  It is truly breathtaking and extremely functional!!
Communication – it is a valuable cornerstone of your performance.  You kept us abreast of every situation – and they are bound to occur in a house that is over 50 years old.   Your suggestions for solutions gave us options, which appealed to my sensibilities. 
Your team of professionals were remarkable and it is our privilege to acknowledge them.
Kim’s design ideas along with her education on products and materials, gave us the intelligence to make important decisions.  She is so sweet, a pleasure to work with – I miss coming to the showroom to go over the plan with her.
Andrew’s work ethic is one for the record books!!  His boundless energy and determination to get my kitchen done was his ultimate priority!!  We felt so lucky to be in his infallible hands.  A true craftsman!!
Maynar and his cousin are flooring geniuses!!  Their talent of feathering in the new kitchen hardwood to the dining room is unbelievable.  The stain color is so rich and the steps are gorgeous.  
Robbie, your son, is a wonderful Project Manager.  His attention to detail is phenomenal, his diligence to protect our floors when the appliances arrived surely saved us from catastrophe.  He is a personable young man with great communication skills, apple didn’t fall far from the tree!  
Integrity, Quality, Experience, Reliable, Talented --  these are some of the words that we associate with KraftMaster Renovations.   To those who are embarking on this journey of home renovation, you couldn’t be in more capable hands.  I know you will be truly astonished with their capabilities – we are!!"
5,"Kitchen first and now the Living Room!

After Bob Gockeler and his incredible KraftMaster crew finished work on our Kitchen (see review from October 2015), it was only natural to move on to the living room. We've been busy relaxing in our new space, so it has taken a while to write this review.

Once again, everyone at KraftMaster exceeded expectations (while keeping the project within budget).  From Maureen and Kim's design suggestions and drawings to Robbie Gockeler's (Bob's son) project set-up and support, to the fine craftsmanship and attention to detail by Bob's subcontractors--not to mention our additions to the project--we were totally satisfied.  Can't wait to start work on the upstairs!"
5,"Review of Master Bath Renovation by Kraftmasters

Summary:
Very pleased with both the design and construction of the new master bath.
Kraftmasters was the most creative contractor we spoke with when trying to come up with a design to fit in our fairly difficult space constraints.
The work crew was attentive to our home and made every effort to minimize the disruption.
The workmanship was top notch.
The end result was just what we had hoped for.

Discussion:

We spoke with several contractors about renovating our master bath.  The problem was we had a dressing area with a sink and a closet and a separate bath with another sink, a toilet and a bath tub with shower.  We wanted a separate walk in shower, but the configuration of the rooms made it a real challenge to design a renovation without making undesirable concessions.  Bob and Kim were the only contractor/designers who said they could up with a plan to meet our needs, and they did.  We brainstormed with Bob and Kim and together we came up with a creative design that had a walk-in shower, and separate room for the toilet, a tub, and a reoriented closet with an entrance from the master bedroom rather than the bath.

Kim not only came up with the initial overall design, she provided very helpful input to assist us in making all the detailed design decisions.  Kim went shopping with us (at vendors recommended by Bob) for granite counter tops, floor tile, and bathroom fixtures.  We were able to select our cabinets right in Bob’s showroom in Chatham, and the cabinets are very attractive and well made.

The job was started promptly.  Bob arranged for the construction permit and scheduled the needed inspections.  The first step in the project was to put down protective material in the garage (where the construction material was stored), on the stairs, and in the master bedroom) to minimize the impact of the construction on the areas near the construction.  (It is construction so there is still going to be a considerable amount of dust and dirt, it is unavoidable).

Bob’s work crew were all friendly and knew what they were doing.  Tony, the foreman, did most of the plumbing and the layout of the framing.  He was very attentive to detail and consulted with us when he thought there was a decision to be made.  Yuri did a number of jobs and did them well, but he really showed his talent as the tile installer.  He did a super job installing the tile in the shower, the tile around the tub, and the river pebble floor in the shower.

Towards the end the job took a bit longer than anticipated as Bob had a number of jobs going at the same time and so the crew was not as available to us as they had been when the project was started.  Bob gave us a quote at the start of the project and the quote was only changed for areas that we agreed to.  The total cost of the project was somewhat over our initial budget, but we felt that it was worth the extra cost to get all of what we wanted.

Upon completion, we could not have been more pleased.  The workmanship was top notch, the design works as planned and is very pleasing to us, and all the detailed design decisions came together to create a Master Bath that we thoroughly enjoy."
5,"KraftMaster Renovations is an amazing company and we always enjoy working with them. They are extremely efficient, passionate, and they truly go above and beyond."
5,"Bob Gockeler and his team at KraftMaster Renovations are magicians.  After living in our 30 year old home for 12 years, we decided to undertake a massive master bath/closet renovation. This soon expanded to a new foyer staircase and hardwood floor refinishing. A three month project.  From the very first meeting with Bob's crack design team of Kim and Maureen, we were hooked.  Kim and Maureen were able to translate our conflicting, jumbled list of ideas into a workable plan- suggesting viable alternatives to our non workable ideas and giving rise to new thoughts through their design expertise. Once construction started, Andrew and Igor-  young men who were obviously master craftsmen, far ahead of what their ages would suggest, were on the job. They epitomized professionalism. Tremendously talented and a pleasure to have work in our home. When the time came to finish the hardwood floors and the newly rebuilt staircase in the foyer, Bob revealed his wizard of hard wood-  Eugene. Eugene is a Rembrandt in terms of matching new stain with that first put down 30 years ago.  They blend seamlessly.  Every day, Bob Gockeler was on site, reviewing and inspecting the progress, making sure that the work held up to his very high standards, which far surpassed ours as homeowners. When complete, the team retreated as if they had never been on site- the worksite was clean, all debris removed. Not a day goes by that we don't remark how much we love this new addition.  Thank you Bob."
5,The master bathroom is perfect. Nicole at Wayne Tile was knowledgable and professional. She helped me pick out the perfect carrera marble in one day. Andrew did an amazing job installing it. He is truly talented. We are very happy with the Perrin and Rowe fixtures that Kim helped us to select.
5,"All of the people associated with Kraftmaster are professional and give the utmost care to detail.  No item is too small to be given huge attention.  The utmost care was given to my entire home throughout our renovation.  Everyone was on time and always delivered exactly what they promised.  Every renovation causes an interruption to your normal household flow, this one was almost undetectable thanks to the entire crew.  Great Job Kraftmaster!"
5,"We have been doing business with KraftMaster Renovations/Kitchen Intuitions for several years. They are knowledgeable, efficient and  client-focused.
They are a pleasure to work with, and possess a professionalism that instills confidence.  GlassCrafters, Inc."
5,"My husband, Frank, and I decided it was time to completely remodel our kitchen.  We initially met with two different kitchen/bath designers.  For various reasons we were not satisfied with what they were proposing.  We had passed by Kitchen Intuitions in Chatham, NJ and decided to stop into their shop.  That is when we met owner, Bob Gockeler/KraftMasters Renovations.  We set up an appointment with Bob and his designer Kim to discuss our kitchen remodel.  We immediately knew that their professionalism, enthusiasm and creativity set them apart from the other kitchen companies!

They were extremely thorough in addressing all our kitchen needs.  They accompanied us when we chose the granite and backsplash.  Bob and Maureen made sure that we made the right lighting decisions.  Bob and his entire team always made sure there was a constant line of communication making the whole experience a pleasant one!

Once the demolition occurred they were extremely careful to keep the dust confined to the work area.   Within a very timely fashion, our new kitchen was completed!  The quality of the workmanship was superb!  For the first time after completing a project in our home, we can highly recommend KraftMasters Renovations!"
5,"The KraftMaster team was nothing short of top notch. I would hire them again in a heartbeat. From design thru finish Bob & Kim were professional, on time, on budget, creative, and very user friendly (text, email, etc). I felt that I was informed every step of the way. I was particularly impressed with their attention to detail and willingness to suggest alternatives that might not add to the value. Most contractors try to upsell you on specific items, where I felt like Kraftmaster was a partner in the process. A+ team, would highly recommend their work."
5,"We hired KraftMaster Renovations to design and install a new expanded kitchen in our 125 year-old Victorian home.  They did a wonderful job.  The design process was thorough and detailed.  The installation was quick and professional with outstanding attention to the detail of the moulding and trim.  Selection of granite and tile went so smoothly, I shouldn't have spent the hours on my own at the tile store looking at random tiles.  Our family loves the kitchen, which can now accommodate five sitting at the center island!"
5,"Kraftmaster is an excellent company providing their customers with everything they need to complete their kitchen or bathroom renovations. They are great to work with as well as open to innovative products and ideas which make any project come alive. From traditional elegance to cutting edge contempory, look no further than Kraftmaster Renovations!

5,"Kraftmaster Renovation is an excellent company to work with. Starting with the Owner Bob to every person on his team, they are all very professional.  
From the design phase all the way through final closeout they have one goal in mind which is: "" To give their clients the highest quality job possible""

As an Architect who has worked with Kraftmaster on dozens of projects, I always feel confident that the job is being done in accordance with plans and at a very high level of quality."

Thank you!

5,"We are so thrilled with the way our kitchen turned out.  From the beginning, Bob and his team were very thoughtful, had great suggestions and asked tons of questions to build a kitchen according to the needs of our lifestyle.  The work they did was impeccable and kept us in the loop of when everything was going to be done.  We were nervous because of all the bad stories you hear about renovations, but we had no problems nor delays.  A much better experience than we could have imagined coupled with the end result, made us want to do more including our family room and powder room. We would recommend Kraftmaster for their thoroughness, communication and excellent work.  Thanks Bob and team!"
5,"Our experience with Kraftmaster Renovations has been fantastic. There are many people who own their own company, but Bob Gockeler is much more than an owner - he is a leader, and the people who work for him follow his example. Bob has so much integrity and is a person of his word. That might sound like fluff, but it's not - it's absolutely true. He has an amazing attention to detail, follows through on everything that he says he will do, and makes great suggestions and recommendations without being judgmental or pushy. What's so amazing - because it's so rare - is that he has managed to assemble an entire company of like-minded people, that truly care about the quality of their work.

Everyone who works for this company is great at what they do and is a true professional. If we had to pick 3 things that make Kraftmaster different from everyone else, we'd say: 1) They *genuinely care* about the quality of your project, from beginning to end; 2) Unlike so many construction companies that use subs, they employ their work crews, so you see the same teams of workers throughout your project; 3) Their work crews are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and put in a full day's work, every day, allowing your project to get done on time. 

We would not hesitate to use Kraftmaster again - in fact, we can't imagine using anyone else."
5,"Bob & Co. did an incredible transformation in our beautiful old 1800’s house with a 1970s era kitchen. Of all the people we interviewed, he was the most straight-forward with budget, deadlines, etc. 

What neither of us anticipated was the previous owners that did the 70s renovation on the kitchen did so without permits (or skill), and because of moisture damages, Bob had the fun job of figuring out how to gut the ENTIRE kitchen down to the dirt and up to the ceiling. I can’t stress enough how diligent and fair he was in figuring out how to achieve this without (completely) breaking the bank. We feel that if we would have chosen any other company, we would have been left in the dust, literally...  

In the process, we turned lemons into lemonade and moved some walls around, added a wet bar, switched the bath and Laundry rooms and he took on all the challenges gloriously! He’s not one to bark orders either while disgruntled workers do his bidding- he gets in there and does some of the work himself, not afraid of getting his hands dirty. He’s also really thoughtful about solving problems and I never saw him lose his cool during the entire process. His design partner Kim also helped us figure out the layout, colors, finishes, etc. and agreed to meet us at showrooms on weekends, nights or whenever we wanted.

Bob also worked really well with our flooring and insulation companies to time everything out and organize what needs to happen and when.

So now we have an incredibly beautiful new kitchen on a solid foundation, a new bathroom, laundry room, and because of removing a wall in another part of the house, a beautiful open concept living room. He even mounted our TV :)

We’ll definitely use Kraftmasters again for our future renovations (watch out 70s master bathroom!) and would highly recommend them to whoever needs a competent, friendly, hard-working-true-to-his-word contractor."
5,"KraftMaster Renovations remodeled our kitchen and did a fabulous job.  We interviewed several companies and Bob was able to give us our dream kitchen.  The KraftMaster team was very professional and neat.  They cleaned up each and every day, which is a major plus!  I would recommend KraftMaster to everyone!"
5,"Let me start by saying that the work that Bob and his team did on my kitchen, bathrooms, and various other rooms is simply beautiful. This is a team of professionals, ( and I stress the word professionals) , that go above and beyond to make sure that your vision comes to fruition. Never, at any time did we hear the words "" can't be done "". This company truly cares about the work they do and it shows. I also must add that during the entire process, every time we reached out to Bob with a question or concern he was always available to talk, which is hugely important while going thru a renovation. I would never under any circumstance consider doing any work in my house without Bob and KraftMaster leading the way!!"
5,"KraftMaster Renovations completed our kitchen renovation and we cannot be more delighted with the outcome.  They were able to open up the area between the kitchen and dining room as well as replacing a window with a French door to the outside to make for a beautiful and  functional space that has a better flow and is overall a big improvement to our quality of life in our house.  

Bob was always sensitive and responsive to any questions or suggestions and his designer, Robin, had the vision that  considered our desires while making sure that the final outcome was functional and lovely!

5,We had our kitchen renovated several years ago and in the process also had all the flooring in our home replaced with a laminate flooring.  The results are fantastic.  I love the new kitchen design layout which included a slight change to the flow through the house.  It's just awesome.  The quality and workmanship is great and was done within our budget.
5,"As the father of a severely mentally and physically handicapped son, we constantly face disappointment. When we required a bathroom to be  customized and build a walk in shower without any barriers, allowing our son to be wheeled directly in, the quotes and contractors we met with were either uninterested, lacked imagination or the credentials. Our last meeting was with Bob. He and his extraordinary crew of craftsmen spent hours discussing, drawing and reviewing the project. Regardless of the unexpected obstacles they faced, they remained steadfast and undeterred in ensuring the project remained on time and on budget. In fact, when a vendor priced a product too low, Kraftmaster kept to their contractual and ethical standards and automatically paid the higher price instead of handcuffing us and making us pay. Their team never missed a day, worked weekends, never left to work on another job and Bob constantly visited to ensure that no stone was left unturned. Furthermore, the bathroom will appeal to those who are non handicapped due to the innovative design and finishing details. No, I am not related to Bob. No, Bob did not pay me or promise to do work no-charge for this recommendation. There is often a disconnect in the construction world between work ethics and morals. Therefore, I wrote this because it doesn't cost a penny to say something nice for an excellent company  especially when it had such an important impact on our son's quality of life. If you don't believe me, visit Bob's site to see our bathroom or ask Bob to see our bathroom and meet our son.

5,"Bob and his team at KraftMaster Renovations did a brilliant job renovating my kitchen.  We went from a boxey dark, old kitchen to an open concept, bright, welcoming and highly functional space.  They listened to our needs and created a design that complements our lifestyle.  Some of my favorite features include a large 6 sided island with microwave drawer and hidden outlets, plenty of work space between the island and the sink/ stove area and great undercounter lighting.   Another highlight was taking down the wall between the kitchen and dining room and putting in a lovely arch which creates definition of the two spaces while giving an open feel to the space.  

Bob took us through his process, set our expectations, and delivered as promised.  Robin was fantastic in assisting with final design choices such as lighting, tile and even paint colors.  We absoutely love our new kitchen and we highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations."
5,I had my kitchen done through KraftMaster Renovations. Bob was great to work with and him and his team did an excellent job remodeling my kitchen. I was very happy with the work they did and they finished the job the same time they promised. I would highly recommend them.
4,"Bob and  his team renovated our master bath about a year ago and they did a fantastic job.  He is a true professional and worked very closely with us to ensure all of our needs were met and he even anticipated our need before we knew it.  He and his team were very respectful throughout the whole process.  I would not hesitate to use him again for our renovation needs.  He is a class act.

5,"KraftMaster was an excellent company to work with.  All of the employees were top notch.  Their attention-to-detail was the best.  From the initial meeting, to placing the order, to all the work that followed, all steps were perfectly executed.  Our kitchen & family room are the envy of many visitors now, thanks to KraftMaster.  You won't find a better company to work with!"
5,"The KraftMaster Team is truly the Dream Team of professionals when it comes to renovations. The project started right on time and throughout the process the team kept us abreast of what is next and what to expect. 

The craftsmen and designers are top notch. With the detail drawings done beautifully and to scale it is easy to envision the end product. The KMR team also came up with excellent ideas to maximized the use and functionality of the space. The KMR team is very patient, and helped us to choose the right materials on multiple shopping trips in perfectly matched colors.

We are very happy with the detailed work, the overall project, and overjoyed with the outcome.   We could not thank KMR more for the fabulous service!"
5,Kraftmaster did an amazing job creating custom beautiful cabinets for my unique layout and optimized the space. The installation was totally pro and whenever small obstacles came up they were all over it and came up with the best solutions. I would highly recommend them!!!
5,"I hired Bob to completely re-do our outdated kitchen. His crew was fantastic and trustworthy, and they produced beautiful work, even providing clever solutions to help us save money. We are planning to hire Bob and KraftMaster for future renovations!"
5,"We did a renovation of the whole main floor over the Summer. It was a pleasure to work with this company. Everything was possible, nothing was too much for them. It was a large project and it took a while but now that everything is done we are so happy! It worked out perfectly! Thanks to Bob, Robin and Andrew for all the hard work, the patience and the optimism."
5,"We got lucky in finding Bob. We were referred to him from another Professional in our area that left their previous job to go and work with KraftMaster. 

We loved the fact that Bob came over to our home to meet with us and be our ""go to"" person in our remodel. Bob knew all of the construction folks and I felt so secure allowing him into our home. 

Bob completely gutted our kitchen, and completely opened it up and gave us more room, bigger windows, and more natural light. 

Bob knew that I needed someone to spearhead the project. I didn't have enough time to spend all day giving direction. I don't know a lot about materials and the like, but I knew what I wanted the kitchen to look like. He even took me along for the shopping for materials. 

I would highly recommend Bob and KraftMaster to anyone seeking a remodel of their home!"
5,"Our dream master bathroom became a reality with thanks to the team at KraftMaster.  After researching countless hours online and meeting multiple contractors , we found KMR was the perfect fit for us. We had lots ideas, limited budget, and wanted to be an integral part of the renovation process. We were seeking a team that would hold our hand every step of the way, had impeccable attention to detail, provided the necessary thought leadership, and had well documented examples of master bathroom transformations, which is initially what lead us to their website.

Kim was very helpful and patient during the design and redesign process, as well as also with our visits to the showrooms and supply houses.  Andrii is not only a master at his construction trade, he is a true professional that is meticulous, friendly, and a very hard worker.  Each day, he would spent extra time for the clean up efforts and educating us on next steps. Robby ensured last minute supplies were delivered and was onsite managing all of our inspections in a friendly and personable fashion.

Bob and his team all possess the qualities that we rarely find in this business -  passionate, meticulous, friendly, neat, clean, best in class craftsmanship, and a trusted partner.  It's now been 3 months since our bathroom was transformed and it still feels as though we are visiting a spa. Our bathroom came out better than we ever could have imagined! Thanks to everyone at KraftMaster Renovations, Pete & Betsy"
5,"We are very happy with the end result of our project with Bob and his team.  We have an older (1920's) home and we knew we were in for a lot of (probably unpleasant) surprises.  Bob was never fazed by anything that came up during the project.  Five layers of ceiling demolished on the first day!  Needing to replace a toilet in the bathroom upstairs that turned out to be from 1935!  A basement full of plumbing in various stages of disintegration!  Not only Bob, but his entire team, were always positive, professional, and excited with the results of their work.  This was our first major renovation project and we are so happy with how it turned out!  His designers Robin and Jessica really helped to guide our choices, although I will say it is always best to have a good idea of what you want from the beginning.  Tony, Adam, and his entire team were also friendly and professional.

Our home has been transformed from a disjointed nightmare (prior addition with ""in-law suite/rental apartment"" had the only usable kitchen) to a floor plan that flows from one end of the ground floor to the other.  All of this was accomplished in keeping with the traditional feel of the house and with a reasonable budget, considering how much was accomplished!  A year ago I couldn't sit in the kitchen and type this review on my laptop and hear the kids if they went to another room--now all I have to do is lean back and I can see them.

We highly recommend Bob and would work with him again!"
5,"Bob and his team did an amazing job designing our new kitchen.  We now have a functional room with plenty of  work space and storage space and it is visually  stunning to boot.  From our initial meeting, through the design process and the installation, Bob, Robin and the rest of the team were easy to work with,  professional and dedicated (working right through Super Storm Sandy) to getting the job done right. Addtionally, the project came in on budget  and there were minimal bumps along the way. We couldn't be happier with the end result."
5,"It is atypical to find a company and owner/operator with the morals, ethics, standards of excellence, creativity and personality that meets or exceeds their representation or quotation. ""Customer service, fairness and peace of mind"" are typically not associated with contractors, let alone most companies. In Bob's case, these are exactly his characteristcs, and those of his workers. As the father of a handicapped son, I required a bathroom remodeling that had to be sophisticated yet practical; I required a crew that was professionally responsible and time-sensitive to the project. Bob is a hands-on, honorable, forthright gentleman. He is not a yes man in the sense of agreeing to anything and everything just to get a job. His input provokes thought and positive results. Unlike other contractors who model after magicians and disappear after the contract is signed, Bob was at the work site each day - morning, afternoon and sometimes evenings. His crew works for him and are craftsmen who take pride in their work and showed up on time each day, including weekends. Bob's contract was professional, specific, detailed and he did not nicke and dime for specific changes that most other contractors would have done so, for they are not interested in building long term relationships and either don't care or understand the value of word of mouth, which can either be a businessman's best friend or worst enemy. Needless to say, the result of the bathroom exceeded my expectations, the contract price did not and Bob is a man of his word and worthy of a phone call when you consider a home improvement project. I know that I will not hesitate to call him again in the future."
5,"I hired Bob to renovate, design, and rebuild my two bathrooms in my home. He did a great, high quality job. He worked with me every step of the way and made me feel very comfortable. Even with no planned budget he kept costs to a very reasonable level. Bob is a good fit if you are looking for high quality work and can accomodate anyones budget, high or low. His designers did a great job on everything."
5,"Kraftmaster Renovations and Bob Gockeler gave me the kitchen I have been dreaming about for years.

 Despite my anal attention to detail and last-minute plan changes, he never made me feel I was out of order in my opinions or proposals. 

He was just as excited as I was every step of the way... and especially with the finished product. His crew was clean, reliable and trustworthy."
5,"Our 50 year old kitchen needed to be gutted and we were looking for a contractor that did both the design work and construction. Once we met with Bob, we didn’t need to look further as his quiet enthusiasm and love for design and construction, customer service, and quality was evident throughout our discussion. Bob listened well to what we wanted, gave us several creative designs, was able to easily adjust as the work progressed and we requested changes. All throughout, he was upfront on costs and options, handled the unforeseen behind the wall structural and plumbing surprises, the two layers of ceilings, the 5 layers of floors, and guided us in making the many decisions on the design and materials. He never took shortcuts when faced with problems to fix, and took the extra time to do the job right.

His work crew was on time, very polite, professional, hard working and cleaned up the work area before leaving each night. Bob stayed on top of all the issues, was always accessible, and was patient in guiding us through the process always keeping our vision in mind. We couldn’t wait to get home each night, and see the progress. We thoroughly enjoyed working with Bob and his crew and are delighted with the great design, attention to detail, high quality work, and the resulting gorgeous, functional kitchen that was beyond our dream. Bob provides a high quality, customer focused service, and we would highly recommend him and his team."
5,"We moved from the city to the suburbs and we knew going in that we wanted to redo the kitchen and open up the living space, as soon as spring came around. Initially, we interviewed a couple architects, but all they wanted to do was to mold the house into their vision and not ours. Then we found Bob and he immediately knew what we wanted to do with the space and more importantly knew our design aesthetic. He came up with a great kitchen design, open floor plan and created the perfect space for us. Given our budget, we had resigned ourselves to semi-custom cabinetry, but Bob came through again. He was able to get us a fully custom kitchen with virtually no change in the budget. We gave Bob yet another challenge, a time challenge. We were expecting our second child and we needed all major construction to be done by time the new baby arrived. Bob came through with flying colors. All major construction was done ahead of schedule. We couldn't have been happier. Not only was the work done
in time, the quality of the work was top notch and the construction crew are professional and courteous.

There are several general contractors we could have gone with, but Bob is special. He is a great combination of an architect, kitchen designer and general contractor. He has a great breadth of knowledge when it comes to home construction and we couldn't have chosen better. We would definitely use him for any future home improvement projects and would highly recommend him to others.

5,"Let me start by simply saying that our Kitchen and other home improvements we had Bob work on are simply ""Amazing"". Bob himself is the perfect gentleman, and he has built a team of phenomenal people around him so that you always have the right expert on the right job. On a number of feature requests we made, Bob went above and beyond to discover people as far away as Indiana that could get the job done perfectly. He listened to all our detailed requests and made each and every one of them happen. Robin, his designer, is truly amazing and again she personally went above and beyond to ensure every little detail was perfect, even giving up substantial time to help us get the right products ordered for a part of the project that was outside her scope. Each and every one of the people that worked on the job were incredibly polite and professional - Andrew being a particular star. 

Just to keep the review real, not everything went completely smooth. To be fair we did add significant work to the job, but the job did take longer than we expected to complete. The difficulty of living in a house that is being renovated is not to be underestimated, but no pain - no gain. Now that we are comfortably in our new kitchen and home, everything was worth it and I can't imagine going through this process without a person like Bob, who was available 24/7 to lead the efforts. Bob is so much more than a contractor, his full service design & build solution is truly the white glove service, the standard which all other service providers should strive to deliver. He told us he would never say no & he didn't. Now that the project is done, he is still readily available to fix any minor issues, he is a man that stands over his work. 

Let me just finish by saying, at his very core, Bob is a good man, a perfectionist who is proud of the work he and his team does, a master of his art."
5,"I had a great experience with Bob! I found Bob after searching the web for Professionals near me. After meeting with a few different professionals Bob seemed the best for me and my project. 

He helped me through the entire process, helping me with each step and was great at explaining everything he was going to do, he even came shopping for ideas with me. I am not originally from the US and Bob was very patient in putting it in terms I would understand and explaining the things while comparing them to the European system for me!

This is our first home and our first remodel. Bob remodeled our bathrooms from the top down, as well as ripped out all of our piping that was very overdue for replacement. He treated everything with the best respect in our new home. 

I highly recommend Bob to anyone needing a great professional."
1,"Do not use this guy.  We paid him $2,000 in August, 2021 to come out and give us a design.  Said would be 2 weeks and would get back to us.  Finally, in November, 2021, he gave us a preliminary design.  We discussed some changes and never heard a word back.  We have called, sent emails, and text messages with no responses.  

$2,000 down the drain with nothing to show for it.  Very poor service.  Do not use him!"
5,Mike was great to work with in designing our pool and outdoor living space.  We had a vision of what we wanted but Mike was able to really bring it to life.  His experience came through in helping us make decisions for a final result that was better than we had imagined.
5,"We are extremely pleased with Mike’s design of our pool and backyard transformation. Mike overcame what we thought insurmountable challenges: trees, slope, line of sight, and dimension obstacles. He created a design that is more beautiful than we imagined and has the recreational features we were dreaming of.  Mike has the experience, expertise, and creativity that you are looking for.  We highly recommend Mike Farley."
5,"Mike is a great pool designer!  We didn't think we could fit everything we wanted in, but Mike made it work.  We only had to request one design change since his original was so good.  Mike discussed in-depth the steps that would happen.  Our nasty muddy backyard has been transformed into a backyard oasis.  We know have a sports pool, hot tub, basketball hoop, and a bbq/Green Egg to cook on. 

Mike truly understands how to take a space and make it into a functional living space. So glad we hired Mike for the biggest purchase of our lives."
5,Mike was great from start of design to finish.  Our pool is a difficult pool due to the grade on our lot but Mike was able to get what we wanted in there and his design is beautiful.  He also stepped in when another pool builder pulled out after 16 months of design and permitting.  Our pool needs to go in first due to the shape and size of our lot.  Mike saved our project!
5,"Backyard transformation. The most critical phase of any project is choosing the right designer/contractor to do the job right the first time. When I  started the process I contacted three contractors and had them send out their designer. It quickly became apparent that the scope and complexity of my project would require a special designer. So I started over and I started researching designers not just the contractors as I had done the first time a round. After several weeks of research I narrowed it down to two designers. Mike Farley was my first call. After speaking with Mike over the phone and answering some of his questions I was confident I had found my designer. I decided I would wait until we met in person to make my final decision. Once I met Mike in person and walked the site of the project, I was 100% confident in his ability and knowledge. This was a totally different experience than I had with the other three designers. I knew I had found my designer and Contractor and we begin the process. The process has been seamless, from the initial design phase through the revisions and the selection process Mike has been there to answer all my questions and also offer his opinion and expertise which has made this a great experience. If you’re looking for a  world class designer look no further Mike Farley is your guy."
5,"We hired Mike to do our backyard design and we were not disappointed! We had gone through several designs with different pool companies but were not drawn to any that we saw. When we hired Mike, he had a unique process of meeting with us first and asking a lot of questions to get to know our vision and figure out our budget first. What he came back with blew us away.  He is unique in that he listens to what you want and will create just that, but add in elements that you may not have thought of. For us it was the handing day bed! Thanks for a beautiful design Mike!  - Ginny B."
5,"Highly recommend Mike for your pool designs.  He is very detail oriented and recommends/designs your outdoor living area to match your needs and intended use:  decking, hot tub, pool, pool type and size, equipment.  Most importantly, Mike was responsive and worked in a timely manner to for design-completion in order to facilitate timely construction.  I greatly appreciate his work as he transformed our backyard to a great outdoor living area.  John"
5,"Very professional on all fronts! 

Claffey Pools plays at the top of the construction game!

Mike F is in his craft is true craftsmen ! 

I would say this was a big decision but in downtown Grapevine I would not have choose anyone else ! 

This is my 2nd pool I have built with Claffey and honestly i just would not go anywhere else!

5,"The design of our swimming pool, outdoor living area and firepit way exceeded our expectations. Mike listened closely to our wants in the very beginning and transformed them into a really beautiful backyard environment! Thank You Mike!"
5,"We can't begin to say what a pleasure it is to work with Mike Farley and have him transform our backyard into the paradise that we were looking for.  The design process that he uses, where he gets to know you and what you are looking for and then turns that into reality is truly amazing!  Mike is a master of listening to you and what your desires are, understanding your budget, and bringing it all together into a remarkable design.   He highlighted pros and cons of different aspects, features and functionality of the pool so that we could make informed decisions.  Mike's process lets you iterate on your design(s) and to ensure you get the pool of your dreams.  Mike was masterful at taking our desires and transforming our blank slate into our resort paradise.  We have already recommended Mike to one of our neighbors and would recommend him to anyone!"
5,Mike did a terrific job throughout the whole process from start of design to completion of construction.  His design ideas to complement the house design and property layout were excellent.  He answered all of our questions and communicated well with the construction crew.  Exceeded our expectations!!
