5,"Perfectly. On time, excellent skills, pricing. Accommodating. Listens, suggests, written estimate. Courteous. This company will be our ""go to"" repairmen/installer/renovator. You cannot find more honest workmen. Call them first!"
5,"They did a great job. They rebuilt my closet, hung curtain rods, fixed a kitchen cabinet and drawers as well as a few other small projects. It was very reasonably priced and done quickly. I would definitely hire again."
1,Very poorly. Owner shows up and says his worker was going to be late. I didn’t want to wait and he says he would go get the worker. They never came back.
5,Al & A.J. are two of the nicest & hardest workers I have ever hired. Will use them again!
5,C and H performed their tasks in an excellent manner very professional they did great work. I really recommend C and H for jobs around the house.
5,"Al and his team have been fantastic in both service and workmanship. We needed a shower replaced in our rental home. He not only provided a number of options, but recommended ways to save money as well. The work project itself, Al made sure if there were any concerns we had, he addressed it promptly. We plan to use C&H for a number of other smaller handyman projects we need done both immediately and any others in the future."
5,"Absolutely outstanding -- your search for a handyperson is over. The team arrived always promptly, did outstanding work, and were extremely kind. They always had professional, creative, and sound solutions to our variety of tasks we needed, and did a great job describing their rationale. Prices were great. We will absolutely have them again for any further work....don't hesitate to work with them."
5,"Al was prompt, and he and his worker, did a nice job. Another party suggested pulling up part of a cement walkway, and this route was not so major."
5,Great! No issues. Small job. They offer other services as well.
5,Showed up on time and completed all requested work professionally and quickly. Have now signed up for bi-weekly services.
5,The installation was done in a timely manner and done well.
5,"The job foreman and cleaning person, Rosa, arrived at the advised time. We went over the work to be done. After all the details were worked out, Rosa went to work. The results met my expectations. All interactions were professional. The work was completed on time. I would definitely use C&H’s services again."
5,The whole experience was great! The team members are extremely professional and we are thankful they showed up to help us.
5,"My relative has been living in the same condo for over 50 years and finally agreed to have the junk acquired hauled away. During this process mold was found in a bedroom and kitchen wall. Al, the owner/manager, had given me a reasonable estimate in the beginning, and after finding the mold, another reasonable estimate was given. All work done was professional and on time. One full bath had a new floor installed and a new toilet installed. One bedroom wall needed new baseboard, installation, and painting. that bedroom needed new carpet installed. One kitchen wall was sanded and painted. Whole condo was deep cleaned. All work was excellent."
1,Not sure if this company is in business. I've not received a return call as yet.
5,"Rosa was prompt, professional, and did a wonderful job!!"
5,"Fantastic! The two people who came really worked hard.....scrub bathroom tile floor, tons of dusting, and cleaning from top to bottom."
5,This was my first general cleaning after my deep cleaning last month. I am very happy with the quality of work performed. A great job. I will be setting up future monthly cleaning with C&H.
5,"Al and his crew do an outstanding job! We have used them for both housecleaning and handyman services. Highly recommend. They have done a spring/deep cleaning which made the house look sparkly clean again, as well well as bi weekly cleaning to keep it maintained. In additon, we needed two doors replaced and they were able to handle this in just a few hours and at a reasonable price."
5,When I moved into my house I was disappointed in the condition it was in. I had Al come and provide a estimate to get it cleaned properly. I was very happy with the work performed. Everything that was cleaned sparkled when it was completed. The quality was better than I expected. The cleaning crew was friendly. Al came and made sure that all the cleaning we had agreed to was completed. Will be scheduling a regular cleaning service with the company.
5,"C & H replied to my request on Angie's List online within minutes. An appointment was scheduled the very next day to give an estimate. The work was completed the day after the estimate within 4 hours. They were on time for both appointments. They were also mindful on saving money wherever possible. The screen on the crawl space was an urgent need to keep out unwanted pests and they got it fixed fast! Very professional and friendly. Thanks, C & H!"
5,I was in need of a cleaning company for my home. I was impressed with the initial deep clean. Needless to say the subsequent cleanings have also been good. Very responsive and reasonable prices.
5,"Very well. They stayed on budget, cleared everything with me before and after each phase, were trustworthy and capable."
5,"I hired C&H for a whole-house deep clean. Scheduling was easy, less than a week. The owner, Al, and his crew have been terrific; thorough, responsive, careful and hard-working, The price was affordable and the place looked great afterwards. I've never used a professional service before C&H. I began with the deep clean as a first step, and was so pleased with the results that I decided to have them back on a regular basis. I look forward to spending less of my free time cleaning. Lucky to have found them, and confidently recommend them to others. Included dusting and/or cleaning: wood floors, coated-concrete floors, cabinet/drawer faces, furniture, doors, bathrooms, mirrors/windows, sills, appliances, etc, etc."
5,"C&H cleaning is a great cleaning company . They did cleaning both my house and office, they have went through all details needed to be cleaned. The’re work shows how professional they are. I asked for additional areas to be done and they were happy to do so. I am very comfortable with this company to work with I have requested them to clean my house byweekly and office weekly. Very happy and satisfied customer that would love to recomed them to anyone is need for cleaning."
5,Fabulous Best cleaning crew I’ve ever had.
5,"It went great. Al and one of his handymen arrived on time, completed the job quickly, cleaned up after the work, and then helped my neighbor with a job he needed done. They split the cost between the two of us, which was very nice!! They have a two hour minimum, and each job took less than half an hour. But, it was worth it to each of us to have the jobs done and done well. My kitchen is nice and bright now!! I would definitely hire Al and his crew again. The cost shown below is my half of the bill."
1,"Terrible. I got a quote of 220-240. It cost 280. That's not the worst. I had the walls repainted and the windows done so those did not need to be done during this cleaning. I cleaned out the refrigerator myself. This house is a 1100 sq foot house with 3 small bedrooms and 2 small baths & a kitchen, living room. 3 bedrooms & living room have wood floors. All they had to do in those rooms is clean the wood floors and wipe down the blinds. The one bathroom had a shower the other a tub. Shouldn't take more than l/2 hours to clean both. I had pre-cleaned the stove so all it needed was wiped out. When I saw the house after 10 hrs (2 people 5 hours each), I couldn't believe how much they didn't do. I discussed how unhappy I was with the person who I guess is their supervisor and he started telling me I was wrong so I told them to get out. I spent the next two hours redoing all the wood floors, cleaned the bathrooms again and cleaned the tile floors in the kitchen and hallway. I have picture of the amount of dirt I got off these floors. They must have been either talking on their cellphones the whole time and talking among themselves because they certainly didn't clean the house. I would never want anyone to hire them. I only included two pictures of the 8 I took of the dirt left on the floor. I also cleaned behind the refrigerator, which they didn't."
5,"Excellent work performed, complete with painting and clean up."
5,"Since we have been using C & H we couldn’t be more happy with our monthly cleaning service. Al has been wonderful and attentive to details, time, communication, and overall professionalism since day one. The cleaners that he has sent to our home have continued to show outstanding performance and we’ve been very happy with the results and cleanliness after each visit. If there is ever a concern Al always takes the time to address the issue and make changes as needed. I highly recommend using C & H for your house cleaning services, we were lucky to have found them!"
5,All went well. Al is very professional and super responsive! He is willing to work until everything is perfect. Will definitely hire again!
5,"We utilized C&H for several handyman projects in a recently purchased condo, as well as a full cleaning in advance of move in. The handyman project including replacing the door moulding, and putting new thresholds and weather stripping on the doors. Well done! The cleaning was done well, with particularly work well done in the kitchen area, to include dishwasher, oven, stove top, and all cupboards and sink. The owner of the company, Al, is a highly customer centric individual, whom only wants the customer to be well served and completely satisfied in the project results. He met me in advance of the projects and totally understood the work to be done. He was early for the four times we met, his crew was on time, he gets his hands dirty, he is a problem solver, and he is there for the end of the job for final inspection. He is a man of high integrity. I recommend C&H for any handyman or cleaning needs you may have. Start with Al!"
5,"After a disappointing job by Molly Maids, I hired C&H to do the job right. Rosa worked her magic and the place sparkles! Al was very responsive when we were setting up the appt and he arrived with Rosa to go over what needed to be done. He also came back at completion and rolled up his sleeves and helped sweep out the garage. Many thanks for your hard work!"
1,I am not impressed. The cleaners did not wipe away the dust around the fireplace or move a small fridge to clean the hardwood floor underneath. The house was completely empty and we were told the job would last 6-7 hours. When my husband returned home at 6 hours he found the cleaners sitting in the car. When I swiped a finger inside the bathroom drawers they came back dirty. Clearly they had not been cleaned or if they had it was not done with a note for detail. So after spending $420 to have the place “professionally” cleaned I will have to take off of work prior to moving in to clean myself. Completely unacceptable. Clearly this was an overpriced superficial clean.
5,"There were three workers for about 5 hours at a cost of $630. They worked non stop and were able to remove a rust stain on the tile in the shower, years of dirt on a heat lamp in the ceiling and many other feats due to negligence. The owner arrived with the team and checked back at noon and at the end of their time always checking their work and making sure they were taking care of the specific things I had requested. It was a great experience and I will now be using them twice a month."
5,"C&H Cleaning & Handyman Services Formally Cristina and Jared's Cleaning I have used C & H Cleaning and Handyman Services for about a year and a half. I highly recommend their services. Originally I hired them to clean my house before a party. While they were at it I had them fix some things around the house. They did such a good job I hired them to clean my mothers house for an event and then I gave my daughter a clean house as a Birthday present using their services. Currently they come every two weeks to clean my house and they do a very great job. Usually I have the same person all of the time, she is very through and efficient. She helps do special little projects, like cleaning and organizing a closet. On occasion when the regular person could not come, Al the owner comes with the replacement to make sure that they know what I like. They also bring their own cleaning supplies. They use something better than BONO on my wood floors. I found they also steam carpets , so I had them steam clean an area rug that was filthy and had really thick pile. It looks great now."
5,"I had 3 cleaners here for an entire day. The house sparkled when they were done. The cleaners checked with me a few times during the day as they finished areas to make sure that I was pleased, and they followed up on any areas that I pointed out to them. After the house cleaning, they cleaned the carpets in the main traffic areas of the house and the master bedroom. The carpets looked great, and it was so convenient to have everything done at the same time. The cleaners worked really hard and Al checked with me at the end of the day to make sure everything was done to my satisfaction."
5,"incredibly easy, affordable, and did great work."
5,"Everything went perfectly. The owner and his employee (I believe her name was Rosa-I apologize I have an awful memory for names) arrived promptly at the appt time. I had 1 worker for 4 hours. They asked me what my priorities were, which I told them were bathroom then kitchen then living areas. I have a bad knee and cannot kneel on the floor to scrub tub or floors. Bathroom sparkled when finished. Kitchen cabinets were wiped down as I requested, baseboards cleaned, floors cleaned. All wooden blinds dusted, as well as furniture, and carpets vaccumed. I was completely happy and satisfied with the work that was done."
5,"I just wanted to let you know that we are very pleased with our cleaning today by Rosa I have tried three other services before. Two of them were flakes and either did not show up or called in sick at the last minute, both times we were expecting company and we didn't have a clean house! Also, one of the cleaners broke an item and didn't even tell us! I discovered it later. The last one came twice with a team of SIX! Both times I had to have them come back to clean things they missed or didn't do well. Not only did Rosa do a better job than the previous cleaners, but a better job than TEAMS of cleaners! She is also very polite and respectful. Thank you Rosa, we will be setting up a regular cleaning each month with you!"
5,We have hired them for regular cleaning
5,"The place sparkled! The cabinets...out and especially inside...looked like new! All they wanted to know from me was whether there was anything more they could do, anything they had overlooked. What could I say? I'm a perfectionist but their work was beyond perfect. In fact, my general contractor, who oversaw the multi-day work, was so impressed with the cleaning company and the owner that he is going to regularly use them on projects he does. When one professional like the work of another one that much, that is a terrific recommendation."
5,"Al called me back at 6 pm at night, just to schedule. He was wonderful to work with. My tenants gave me some issues with scheduling, so we had to change a few times, but he was so easy to work with and changed dates for me. Dominique showed up on time, so happy and full of energy. She was very attentive and gave attention to detail. We will be scheduling with them again! Thank you!"
5,"Several days before the cleaning appointment, Abdul came to our apartment and did an assessment. He carefully wrote detailed notes of what I specifically wanted done. On the day of the cleaning Rosa arrived exactly on time. She worked diligently on each task and did a great job making our apartment sparkle and shine! I appreciate Rosa’s thorough work ethic, her valuable experience in cleaning homes and her friendly personality. I’ll definitely refer this company to my friends and family members and schedule Rosa to clean our apartment on a regular basis."
5,"I spoke with Al on the phone to give him a scope of work needed. He set an appointment to meet at the property to give me a quote, which allowed me to show him specific work ahead of time. We set an appointment for cleaning and the had two housekeepers clean the unit. He also spent some time doing some of the work himself, mainly shining and oiling the wood floors. They did a wonderful job. They did specific cleaning that the pending tenant requested. When they were done, but place just shined, and smelled good too! I would definitely use Al's company again, and HIGHLY recommend it."
4,"Three people plus the supervisor arrived about 1/2 hour late. They were here for about 6 hours. The service charges based on time spent per individual worker. The supervisor, Al, comes and goes to check on the staff. The quality of the cleaning was good and thorough. The amount of time spent by the crew, including lunch and breaks, was probably somewhat longer than needed. After reviewing the completed job, areas that did not meet our requirements were re-cleaned to our satisfaction."
5,"I have used Kristina & Jareds Cleaning three times now to clean up my home before company arrived. They have been very responsive and accommodating in my requests. (I work so my schedule is difficult.) Each of the three cleaners was cheerful and efficient. Their work was very good. After each cleaning, I felt like someone gave me 4 hours of my life back since the rooms were beautifully clean and I could do my own work instead! Worth the money!"
5,"My husband and I have been using Kristina & Jared’s Cleaning Service for about one year. Rosa comes to clean our house every two weeks and we are extremely satisfied with the professional and high quality cleaning work performed by Rosa. She is always punctual, efficient, hard working, and pays meticulous attention to details. Both Rosa & Al (the owner) are very friendly, attentive, flexible, and reliable. We very much value the trusting long term working relationship we have with Al & Rosa and will enthusiastically recommend Kristina & Jared’s Cleaning Service to anyone in San Diego who needs house cleaning service."
5,It went very well until I discovered they had taken $980 in cash from my money box. I simply did not think about moving it as I had told them not to do anything with the cabinet on which I keep it. I contacted the company and he interviewed the cleaners and even brought them to the house to show them where the money had been. They denied having taken it and there was no way I could prove that the money had even been there. The only way to resolve this is to take them to small claims court and that would again be just my word against theirs. So - I WILL NOT be hiring them again.$18
5,"The person arrived right on time. She was friendly and polite. She started right in and we left her alone, we could hear her working away. After 4 hrs. she had finished exactly what we had agreed to. The floors and counters were really clean. We had no complaints. We contacted Al to repeat the service again this month."
4,Very slow. It took her 2-1/2 hour for the master bath only. Then forgot to clean a glass shelf.
5,Friendly professional team that I will invite back help me deep clean the parts of my condo that are hard for me.
5,The servicer was polite and on time. The cleaner was thorough and very friendly. Excellent Job!
5,"they showed up with 4 men and really turned to. great job. the moved, and cleaned under and around every thing, window tracks etc.. great job."
4,OK - could have made somewhat more progress in the hours allotted.
5,"I originally purchased the deal for 1 person for 4hrs, but after talking with AL, I decided to pay for a second person to help Maria and Rosa did a great job! I enjoyed having them in my home. The tile floors and baseboards thru out the entire condo that were so filthy in the beginning looked great after these ladies were finished."
5,"If you want a clean house with people who are consistent and responsible, this is the company for you. They may cost more, but they are more than worth it. Al is great and Rosa is awesome."
5,Wonderful company to work with. Al is very nice and communicative. I was very happy with their attention to detail.
5,"Al and his team of three cleaners arrived right on time. We walked through the rooms they'd be cleaning and discussed particular areas of concern in each (oven, fridge, hard water stains on faucets, etc.). Al also explained that this was a new crew, so they might not be the fastest, but he promised they'd be thorough. Sure enough, they were. Maria, Gina, and Leroy did a phenomenal job -- everything was sparkling clean when they left. They also did some extra things like vacuuming and sweeping the main living room right before they left, and Leroy took out a bunch of trash that we'd piled up as we were packing -- it wasn't even their cleaning trash. The last thing of note was that Maria saw one of my earrings as she was loading their vacuum into their car. She rescued it from the vacuum canister and rushed back to hand it to me. I really can't say enough good things about this experience -- the team was helpful, honest, thoughtful, thorough, and friendly. I would use Kristina and Jared's again, and I would recommend them to anyone."
5,"Rosa got here on time when they said someone would be here. She asked me what I wanted done in the 4 hrs she would be here. I told her the important things that I wanted done, and she did them professionally and great service."
5,"These guys did an impeccable job both times I've hired them. In the ten years that I've hired cleaners not one has done as detailed a cleaning job as these guys. The owner is great, highly communicative, and cares deeply about customer satisfaction and quality work by his team. After these two one time jobs I am definitely going to sign them up for regular cleanings. These guys do a lot of the things that other cleaners cut corners on - things like not dusting baseboards/doorframes, leaving small boxes unmoved where things could be easily cleaned, rugs, closets, etc - but these guys take care of everything the first time every time. Really impressed."
5,Superbly. I am pleased with the professionalism of Kristina and Jareds Cleaning Service and the outstanding service provided.
4,"They did ok. It wasn't a perfect job, but it was a great relief. It had gotten pretty bad around here. We had no cause or an real complaint. The floors were real streaky when they got through. It could have used another clear rinse. We are not complaining really. Price was reasonable. It seemed appropriate. They were on time as much as you could be on time considering the freeway. He works for somebody else."
5,"I have been with K&J Cleaning Service since it's inception when it was formerly ""Kristina and Jared's Cleaning and Handyman Services."" After a somewhat rocky start when it was starting up, I am particularly pleased with the work of Vincent, one of the workers, (and Al, the proprietor/manager). Vince provides that extra ""something"" that is vital in home care (and does it pleasantly and with apparent joy)."
2,"Date of service was postponed several times by agency and when finally somebody came to clean the house did not do a good job. Very light cleaning: didn't dust, didn't washed dishes, bathroom tubs were left with a black circle around the drain, and other basic cleaning things were missed."
3,"I have an 1800 sq foot house. I live alone, My house is clean & neat. I wanted a general cleaning. They asked me what was most important to me, because they could not clean my whole house in the 4 hr window. I said the bathrooms, family room, kitchen were most important. They said they could not do all that in the four hours. So I said the most important things to me was the bathrooms & didn't want them to leave without doing the floors. And that is all they did in 4 hours, the bathrooms & floors. The bathrooms include, a powder room, used only for guests & is neat & clean, the master bath, which is not moldy or dirty, no soap scum build up in shower or on the shower door & the hall bath, used when I have company stay, Then they vacuumed the carpet & washed the kitchen floor & tile floor in the entry & dining area. What they did was excellent. They paid attention to detail. But I've had house cleaners many many times over the years so I know what cleaners do in a 4 hour period of time, as well as what I can do. I was going to check them out to see if I would want them on a regular basis. i was not happy with what they were able to accomplish in that time. I told the gentleman that, He said they don't just go in & wipe up. They do the job to really get things clean. I will say what they did was good work, just very slow. i would not hire them again."
5,They did a fantastic job. Even my mother was impressed.
4,They were very thorough and the 4 hrs I booked were not enough time for the detailed cleaning they did. What was done was great.
5,"The cleaning of the bathrooms far exceeded my expectations. They were much, much cleaner than I had ever managed on my own. The wood floors look great too. I highly recommend the service."
3,"The first time, was good, but the second and third were fair. I'm going to end up going with someone else. I'm sad that the business was sold and is now being run by someone else. The first person that came out was with the original owners, and the last two times where with the new people. I really wish they would charge by the hour because my house doesn't need 4 hours worth of cleaning. Try them for yourself, but I'm being cautious."
5,"Ultimately it went well. The housekeeper arrived right on time and worked very hard to get my house clean in the time allotted. The company was ultimately very professional. The Saturday before my Monday morning cleaning, they called to cancel my service as their cleaner had become unavailable. I politely asked for a refund as I needed the service done that day in advance of arriving guests and my request was going to be granted. They then called back within the hour to say that they'd found another housekeeper to perform the service. I really appreciate that they ultimately honored the appointment. Wish we hadn't had to go through the stress of the cancellation first, though."
5,"They did a very thorough job. The cleaners were on time, friendly and did exactly what I asked them to. After letting my previous house cleaning service lapse a year ago I will be sticking with Kristina and Jareds"
3,"It was just ok. We live in a small condo so 4 hours of work should be plenty of time to clean. I had two small requests, time permitting, to sweep the leaves off the back porch and to fold the clothes I took out of the dryer the night before. I tipped quite well because im aware that this isnt what they normally do. They did do the things, but thet left me a snarky note about it so I decided I would not be using them again."
5,"They did great work and never stopped moving. Very pleasant, very professional"
5,"very well, will rehire for further services"
5,"He was professional, delightful and thoughtful. His only issue was getting stuck in traffic and being late. He stayed until the job was done. As I need more help around the house I will ask for Al again. Thank you! I will be requesting cleaning services soon."
5,"Al is very reasonable and flexible with schedule, fee, and payment options. Rosa has done a wonderful job making our home look beautiful and sparkling every time she visits. I would recommend this company and service to any one."
5,"Al and his entire team were great! James, Rosa G. and Yanette worked very hard for two plus days; scrubbing kitchen surfaces, inside large oven vent hoods, bathrooms, floors and other surfaces until everything was clean. They were very polite and helpful with many extra requests. Al and James even moved furniture from one room to another when asked. Al also made minor repairs. He re-caulked one of my shower stalls and replaced hard to reach light bulbs throughout the house. I liked these folks so much that I hired them to clean my house on a bi-monthly basis. I highly recommend Al and his team to anyone looking for a polite, dependable and hard working household cleaning firm."
5,"Fabulously! My house was tidy, but not sparkling clean. After these professionals got through with it, it looked terrific. Wow! What a wonderful feeling to come home from work and see what they had done."
2,"Was to arrive by 1, came at 1:30, was to be 2 people for 3 bedroom 3 bath but only 1 and they did not leave for 7 hours. I have had dual maids and they cleaned more thoroughly in 4 hours. I missed appointments and I was hungry from missing two meals and exhausted trying to find where to be to not be underfoot. Jared came and put together a bike but barely cleaned and brusquely told me they are strictly a move in move out business. That they do not wash anything and with him trying to clean, I had to ask it constantly point out what needed cleaning but after the confrontation I cleaned alongside them despite recuperating from hospital. The one maid is pleasant but cleans with a lot of crashing noise but is through. Jared should never clean, if it gets past time to arrive, he should have rescheduled. Not that that helps me since he made it clear their company is not as if hiring a maid to clean house tho they are called housecleaners."
5,"It was great. Al and Rosa had my old address, (my fault) but they showed up and were so pleasant and hard working. Rosa is amazing! I am so thankful."
5,The 2 ladies came on time and stayed over to finish an extra task that I had requested.
5,The group of 3 showed up on time and did a good job cleaning our 2br condo. I had wanted to clean the counter tops (tiles with grouts) and cook top thoroughly and they did a great job. The cabinets and drawers were not cleaned but they were honest up front about how much can be done with the 4-hour special.
5,"Dominique was incredible! She was prompt, efficient and made my house look perfect just in time for company to come over!"
5,"Al called me back on Christmas day, and came out the next day with a 3-person crew. They got it all done in one day, cleaning construction dust from every nook and cranny. They did a beautiful job with deep cleaning basically everywhere, working nonstop and actually saving the hardwood floor. They were extremely professional and showed up on time. It was a Christmas miracle! I would recommend them!"
3,"The kitchen was cleaned except baseboards as he used steam cleaner for the floor and did not wash the front of the cabinets. Bathrooms were cleaned except the baseboards and around the toilet and that floor area. I had to ask him to clean the area behind the toilet area, which he did in the front bathroom. Unfortunately, I had to run an errand and left my husband in charge of checking the final rooms."
5,"James was right on time and did a fantastic job. The place looks brand new. He was polite and a gentleman. I would hire this company again with James in a heartbeat. James did a wonderful, way above average job."
5,Amazing!! Very nice and professional.
3,"One person arrived, worked for 4 hours. She was personable and pleasant. Cleaned obvious areas, did not move trash containers, smaller items or dining room chairs to clean under or behind on the floor. Dusted around items on furniture, not moving things to dust under. My high-risk pregnancy daughter was cleaning the next day when I arrived to decorate … moving chairs to dust/mop under the dining room table, cleaning under and behind trash containers and several small pieces on the floor, re-dusting shelves and table tops. Interestingly, I'm filing this review WITHOUT you promptly asking for it … makes me now question if I should use your evaluations of services as accurate. Carol Parham"
5,"wonderful experience, highly recommend if your looking for an efficient cleaning service! Above and beyond expectations! Thank you to Jared, Al and Dominique!"
5,They were very punctual and clean and courteous and explained the installation. Worked very hard and got the job done with an excellent product. We installed 2 windows.
5,"Jared was very professional and did a great job. He goes above and beyond just fixing items, he'll also clean them up and leave everything sparkling new."
5,James was very friendly and listened to what I needed done.
5,Excellent. A lot of deferred work completed on time and in budget. Very professional.
5,"Ryan came to our home to clean our house and did an excellent job! He was punctual and very efficient cleaning everything. Thank you, Michael and Linda Neylan"
5,Excellent - beyond my expectations.
5,The best cleaners in my experience. We have had many cleaning services and private cleaners. We won't be changing. Thanks Pablo and Maria
5,Very well. We have had excellent results using the service for three years now. The cost is a good value and varies depending on the amount of work we have done. We tell them the big items we want done and they send the right number of people to do the job in a reasonable time. They work inside and outside and take on any cleaning job we have given them. We found them on Angie's List and are glad we did.
5,Excellent! Cannot say enough good things about the services provided.
5,Excellent service by Jared and James. They showed up exactly on time and quickly determined what was wanted. They performed a deep cleaning on our home including our windows. The windows are especially difficult because each is double pained and twice the amount of sections compared to standard windows. The house had not had a thorough cleaning in some time and they completely brought it up to speed. Their attitudes were pleasant and comforting. We will continue to use this service on a regular basis. The experience exceeded our expectations.
5,"I have had incredible service from Pablo and Maria. They are such wonderful people and take such great care of our home. We have had them cleaning our house for over 2 years now and they have become like our family. It is such a great feeling to come home to a clean home, and Pablo and Maria work miracles on our house they even go above our expectation by clearing out slow draining sink drains and changing out our toilet seat when we bought a new one without even being asked, it is such a pleasant surprise, they anticipate our needs. We have two little girls and we both work full time, so, our house can get a bit chaotic, it is great to have people we can trust, they help us maintain our sanity. Thank you so much we appreciate everything you do!!"
3,"Not well. They were supposed to be at my house at 10:30 am. At 10:45 am, they called to say they would be late, and were just leaving Poway at that time. I live in East County, so I knew there might be a delay. I would have appreciated a call sooner than 10:45. At 12:20 pm they called again to say they were on the way from El Cajon. At 1:40 pm I decided I had waited long enough, and I knew the job would not be done in time for me to move on to other commitments later in the day."
5,"FANTASTIC!!! I was utterly shocked with how amazing my place looked after the cleaning. It was far beyond my expectations. Kristina and Jared cleaned places I did not even think about. They went so far as to use magic erasers on the walls and polish the hardwood floors. The whole place sparkled. Jared came back for a second time to finish the cleaning, and because they did not have the proper amount of time to finish the job, he came back for a third time free of charge to ensure my place was up to par. Kristina & Jared run an honest, good company and I will definitely be having them back to clean again. Thank you Kristina and Jared!!!"
5,Jared is a real professional. Our home was cleaned perfect. He took the time to know exactly what I wanted done. It's rare to find real professionals in this industry.
5,"After health problems, repairs, and an overly busy work schedule, the house was in serious need of cleaning. I also needed to limit the time to four hours due to costs. Ryan’s focus was set for the kitchen, 2 bathrooms, floors, and dusting as time would allow. My mind is much more at ease now that the house is clean. Ryan was efficient, thorough, and friendly. He is an excellent representative for Kristina & Jared's Cleaning & Handyman Service. My husband and I will be discussing having Ryan provide a regular cleaning service for us moving forward as our finances allow."
5,Jared and his assistant did a wonderful job. Everything looks better than we thought it would. He did an excellent job on the wood cabinets. Tile shines. Grout is white again. We plan on using his service again in the next month. We highly recommend him.
5,Both Jered and Kristina were wonderful. They both were friendly and very professional a well as extremely hard workers. They did a wonderful job and we are so happy too have found them. Highly recommended.
5,"Kristina and Jared are the number 1 housekeeping service that I have ever used in my 30 years of services!! They go beyond what is expected and are consistent each week. In addition, the team is so service oriented; they do not hesitate to do the little things that I generally never notice. I will continue to use them until they retire!! (Hopefully not soon :)"
5,"Jared and his team are punctual, efficient, and detail-oriented. They complete all work as expected. I would recommend them to others."
5,"Showed up on time, very important, and they are very thorough. In addition to housecleaning, I have also asked Jared to perform some handyman type chores, and he has accomplished those easily. Nice to kill two birds with one stone."
5,"Jared and his crew are friendly, professional and do a great job cleaning my home on a bi-weekly basis. And they accommodate any special requests. I have several cats so in addition to having lots of fur to clean up, I insist on being home for any services provided. As I work full time, timing was a problem. I really appreciate that Jared was able to accommodate my late afternoon request. I would definitely recommend them."
5,"Dominique was right on time, cheerful and pleasant. She did all the specific tasks I asked her to (including cleaning the windows inside out, scrubbing a bathroom curtain and dusting the ceiling fans). I just wish she had been more detailed in the kitchen and living room cleanup. Some appliances and lamps were cleaned outside but not inside, and some were forgotten. But overall a good job in 5 hours."
5,"Excellent job. This was my first time using Jared's service. Quick responses to enquiries. Arrived on time for the job, which was performed quickly and efficiently. Cleaned dirt out of areas I knew was there, but frankly I hadn't expected to be noticed/cleaned. After this initial job with great results, I have now scheduled him on a regular basis."
4,I used this service for several months. The cleaning was average. The price flucutaed as well as the crew that arrived biweekly.
5,"I've been with Jared and Kristina's for about a year now, and have been extremely happy with their service. I get regular cleaning every two weeks, and have been impressed with the level of professionalism and the attention to detail that they provide. On occasions that I've made special requests or had any questions or concerns, they have been extremely quick to respond and been accommodating. They manage their business and customer service at a high level. I searched a long time for cleaning service that cleans to my level of 'clean' and that I can trust to be in my house; I've found both with Jared and Kristina. highly recommended!"
2,"According to the listing the cleaner is supposed to know how to clean all kinds of surfaces using their own supplies that are ecologically friendly. When I contacted the lister I described the house including all of the surfaces to be cleaned, i.e., stone, bamboo and rugs. Ray was very nice and very punctual. But it was very awkward since Ray kept asking me what cleaning supplies to use. Huh? Ray cleaned the entire house very quickly. Unfortunately, the corners, baseboards, etc. weren't cleanned. I didn't want to review this service because I could not give it a good review and feel bad about that - but the folks at Angie's List keep sending me emails to do so. So here goes. The reason I am giving this service a D is because Ray thought he was helping by moving the furniture so he could clean under it. He gouged the bamboo floors badly. A house cleaner should have the motto ""First do no damage."" Very nice people but not a very professional job."
5,It was a little more expensive than I thought it was going to be based on the deal listed for 4 hours. They were here way longer than 4 hours but I assumed the deal would still stand. They did a good job on the areas they did clean but I had pointed out a few areas and those were not completed. However they did a great job on things I hadn't pointed out but did need to be cleaned They were very nice and very professional
5,We had used Kristina and Jared before and were quite pleased with the outcome. We needed a pretty deep cleaning of our rental units garage (some mold around a water heater). Jarred was very accommodating with getting it done on my schedule and did another outstanding job. Based on his professionalism and punctuality I would recommend them to all my friends and colleagues.
4,Jared reached out to me to follow up on the services provided.
5,"I was present while the work was done and the team worked carefully and hard, they were great. Two and a half kitchens Four bathrooms Five bedrooms Two ""great"" rooms (open floor plan) Four ceiling fans 28 windows Hardwood, tile and carpeted floors Everything went great. In addition to the cleaning work mentioned, Jared is also an handy man. Two extra charge items not in the price above that he did this time were; 1) Seal the granite counter tops in all three kitchens which needs to be done every 18 months to protect them. 2) The front door on one unit is Cherry wood and had weathered in the sun from the southern exposure. He refinished the outside of the door and it looks great."
5,"Cleaner was a few minutes early, and cleaned the house in record time--3Bed/3Bath 2 story in just over 4 hours"
5,"The first time we used them we were moving out of an apartment we were renting while our home was being remodeled. They stuck to their quoted price even though the job was a little more than they expected. We then had them continue to clean our new home. They were very reasonable and professional, again sticking to their quoted pricing even though we were still in the middle of construction while living in our home and there was constant construction dust in our home. I recommend Kristina and Jarod's cleaning service."
5,"Jared has an excellent team. He and his partners are always on time, professional, and my house sparkles when they're finished cleaning. I have 2 young children with nap schedules that must be worked around. Jared is always easy to get a hold of and flexible. I don't normally take time to write reviews, but I feel the need to write a review on Kristina and Jared's outstanding service. Yesterday, Jared noticed that my shower was developing some nasty black mold. Not only did he clean the shower, but he also RECAULKED completely FREE OF CHARGE!! I've never had a cleaning service go so far above expectations! Thanks Jared and team! I will now use Kristina and Jared for cleaning services and handyman services!"
5,"We couldn't be happier with the result in every way. Very clean, totally dust free and love the cleaning products as it left such a pleasant smell, not the least bit chemical smelling or flowery perfume, just really pleasant not overwhelming. We can't say enough good things about this service!!"
5,"Jared did an outstanding, perfect job as always! Floors looked wonderful as well as everything else. He is very sensitive to the environment and especially used products that did not irritate an ill family member during a long illness. He could not be more helpful, kind and flexible. Everything is done with very high standards of excellence."
2,"While the actual work done by the provider was initially more than satisfactory, there are some details that force me to write a negative review. The man who did the cleaning arrived quite late because he had been given the wrong street name by the company. Apparently this forced him to rush through the cleaning in order to make his next scheduled appointment on time. He did an excellent job of cleaning my home, but he damaged a piece of furniture. I called the company the next day and then e-mailed photos of the damage. I got no initial response, but two weeks later, after I e-mailed the company again, the owner responded. He came today to repair the damage and clean my house, but challenged me about the damage to my furniture, claiming that it couldn't have been done by his employee. Having been accused, essentially, of lying about it, I told him that, if he was going to question my honesty, we were done. At this, he walked out, refusing to make good on his employee's carelessness. When I told him that I would be posting this review, he said he would have it ""buried"" within a week. Don't hire this dishonest company."
5,"Pablo and Maria come every 2 weeks, and we love it when they do. The house is so clean after they come. They arrive exactly when they say they will. They bring all their tools and cleaners and special tricks with them. In 2-4 hours, the 2 of them work so hard and clean the house so well, it sparkles when they are done. Pablo and Maria are a great team and they are very pleasant while they are here. They speak great English and Spanish, so communication is never a problem in either language. We have a dog, which can be a little annoying at times, but they manage him and clean around him while they work. He treats them like family now when they arrive. Anything extra we ask them to do, they are happy to do it. They even clean windows (1 a week) to keep them looking good. Maria makes the bed very beautifully, so the night after they come is like going to bed in a resort! They also change sheets on any bed we leave sheets for. Jared is also very good to work with, taking credit/debit card over the phone and rescheduling if needed. Jared and Kristina are good business owners and very customer focused. We can't say enough good about them. Just hire them!"
5,"We live in a large home with multiple living spaces, and have been using Jared's cleaning service for several months. Our main goto person is Ashley, and she has been great! She is very efficient, and our house is always super-clean after she is done. She is also a great communicator and always gets in touch and communicates any schedule or other changes related to the cleaning in advance. We really like working with her and plan to continue using their service on a regular basis."
5,They did an excellent job. I was very happy with the team that came out and the work done by all of them. Their pricing is very fair and I plan on using them on a regular basis.
5,"Dominique does a terrific job. Bathrooms and kitchen sparkle and the rest of my place is dust & dirt free. When I request a change, she is always willing to work with me. I couldn't be more pleased. She's usually on time and if she is going to be delayed she always calls and let's me know. She is a jewel."
5,"This is my third time using their service. Ray is great. My house isn't a disaster, but he makes everything sparkle. My faucets are shiny, Stains left by a contractor when installing two sinks were removed by him today. I'm happy. I am happy not to have to clean the hardwood floors anymore. The owners are very responsive and the price is fair."
5,"Arrived on time. brought all needed supplies including a steam mop for tile floors which really was different from any other cleaning service I have hired before. It made the house feel alot cleaner. also, got cobwebs from high places. went above and beyond what one just sees. Monique was excellent."
5,"AMAZING!! I was TOTALLY stressing my home going on the market and having a bunch of ""handyman"" things to get done and Krisitna and Jareds Service came to my RESCUE. they sent over Ray who seriously knocked it out of the park. I had several challenging projects and Ray took care of all of them and did a great job! This company is the REAL DEAL - professional, very prompt to respond and do QUALITY work! Very satisfied and WILL DEFINATELY use again!!"
5,"From my initial phone call with Jared to the actual housecleaning service, this company has far excelled over the other housecleaning services I have used~at all levels. After in-depth research on Angie's List on a Sunday, I left a message on this company's voice mail asking them to contact me. To my surprise, within an hour Jared returned my call. During my conversation with him, I explained what had not worked for me with the other two companies I have used in the four years I have lived in San Diego. I felt confident to give this company a try and Jared set an appointment for me for the following Thursday with Ray. When Ray arrived precisely on time that day, we went over what was most important to me and he set to work. When he was done, he showed me the results of his labors and I couldn't have been more pleased. Literally, the bathrooms, kitchen and hardwood floors sparkled! Nothing was missed from baseboards and casings to cabinetry and doors. He is very polite, professional and takes pride in his work. I am now booked for the rest of the year."
5,"I am extraordinarily pleased with the care put into the cleaning -- it was not slap-dash. The old kitchen and bathrooms sparkle. I am completely satisfied. The price was less than I expected. Everyone I met was pleasant, friendly, and competent -- no whining, no judgements."
5,"Excellent service from Ray! He came early (before 6a) just to accommodate my schedule, and got to work right away, even though it was still dark outside! The tile looks fabulous - better than it has ever looked, and the garden wall is sparkling clean. The company beat the estimate I was given by a competitor, and the work was exceptional. Ray is very personable and professional - I will definitely use this company again in the very near future (within a week). Looking forward to more great work from Ray. Thank you!!"
4,There were two people. My interaction with them is always good. They always show up when they say they will. They were a little hard to get hold of a couple of times. I think he uses his cell phone for his business and therefore it was kind of hard to reach him. I don't think I would use them in future until I call them and remind them of some things that they missed. If they resolve that then I would use them again.
5,"Once they arrived they got right down to business. Did a very thorough cleaning of a house that really needed a deep clean. There was lots of dog hair, dirt & dust everywhere but that didn't deter them. We went through the priorities at the beginning and within 5 minutes they were at it. I do feel they are a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. Other less costly services I've used definitely didn't do as good a job with the cleaning. These guys are much more detail oriented than other cleaners I've used. Will definitely use again."
5,"Deep cleaning was required before we started our every-other-week service. The deep cleaning was so thorough that many things that I didn't know could shine were shining when the deep cleaning was completed. Pablo and Maria spent several hours with that deep cleaning and have been doing a great job ever since. Both of us work outside of the home and we like peace of mind with anyone providing us service, especially when working inside our home. We have used other cleaning people in the past and often they seemed to be rushing -- leaving lights on or some cleaning supplies behind, etc. With Pablo and Maria, everything is always in nice order when we get home on cleaning day. Jared, who co-owns the company, has been very helpful with the few questions we had when we started up and was always available to take my calls."
5,They showed up on time and got right to work and did a great job. We will definitely use them again!
5,I hired them through Angie’s List for housecleaning. It’s Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service. I’m happy with them. The cost is $100 each time. Only one cleaner comes to clean for about 4 hours.
5,It took them a long time but that was because the job warranted That amount of time and the house was a complete mess! I am so gratefull for them staying and cleaning as much as they did I can't wait for them to come back and finish the rest of my house... I have been able to upkeep what they did and when they finish they will need to keep coming back as my home is just too big a job for me!
5,"So far, we are very pleased with the job done by Jared. Our bathtub and shower are the cleanest we have ever seen them. He brings his own cleaning products, which are all natural, and they leave the house smelling very good. However, he respects our requests to use certain products on our new furniture, in keeping with the manufacturers recommendations. He seems knowledgeable about the best products for cleaning and recommended a better product for our hardwood floors. We are very happy with Jareds work, and plan to use his services regularly."
5,"My home had sat empty for 3 or 4 months at a time while I was taking care of my Mom back east. for 5 years. It was very dusty. Needed a good cleaning. I appreciate the fact that it was Jared that came and I would prolong an appt. just to get him. He knows what he's doing. He had someone come and do the bathroom while he was here and she was very thorough. The ONLY reason I only checked ""good"" under "" quality "" is because the grout on the bathroom floor sat too long to get it really white again. It needs to be done more than once and not their fault. I would recommend them to anyone and I already did to my son & daughter-in-law. Price was reasonable and fair. Look forward to future business with them."
5,We were looking for long term house cleaners to come out on a regular basis. These folks are too notch. Excellent quality of service - Jared really does a fantastic job in getting the place clean. Super nice and professional. Deservedly the best rated cleaning service on Angie's List.
5,"I contacted Jared with confidence after reading the business reviews on Angie's list. I called on a Sunday expecting to leave a voice message and instead I got Jared live. He explained pricing and what to expect. I scheduled my first appointment knowing I would not be home and left a family member in charge. I've yet to meet Jared- only have spoken to him a few times and left a few task lists. My confidence was well placed! Jared and team have done an excellent job inside my home. They are dependable, efficient with their time and handle my home items with respect and care. Jared charges a fair price and shows when he's suppose to and does what he says he'll do. My home has been well maintained but having a home cleaning service that reliably cleans floors, window blinds, ceiling fans, bathrooms and kitchen floors and floor boards is a treat to myself. In fact it is a gift to myself by giving me a real day off on the weekends. I have become a regularly scheduled client and have my home cleaned twice a month. It feels so good to enter a well cleaned home with results that last for 2 weeks. It's just the break I needed. And because I'm staying with a professional service, there's no concerns about the sister of a friend of a cousin cleaning and telling all my business. Thanks Jared!"
5,"I was extremely pleased with the service I received. Jared and his crew were so thorough and professional. I was surprised that they even cleaned the chandeliers, replaced burned out bulbs, cleaned sky lights areas and even vacuumed inside the refrigerator. My house really needed cleaning because of 3 dogs and just having had hardwood floors installed. The house smelled clean, which is hard to accomplish with 3 dogs in the house. I will be using their services on a regular basis for my housecleaning. Their rates for regular service are very reasonable. I would highly, highly recommend Kristina and Jared's Cleaning and Handyman Service."
5,"It went very well...the team, Carlos, Claudia and a third person (can't remember his name), were there on time and ready to go and the condo looked great when they were done. We also added on some last minute requests and asked them to install a new 220 volt electrical outlet adapter to fit our new washer/dryer unit, and to re-caulk the two full bathrooms for us. They did all of this in under 6 hours, but that's because it included a couple of trips to Home Depot to get the right parts. They were very accommodating through the whole process and completed everything we asked them to do. The deep-cleaning was very thorough and very well-done. We will definitely use this service again in the future."
5,"Carlos and team were early! They worked efficiently, did everything I asked, cleaned inside and out (the windows). They know their work and just executed. They were wonderful to work with."
3,"Found out there's a $100 minimum. I just have a small (studio rental) apt, Last time it was done for $45.(+$5 tip) & took 1 lady 1.5 hrs. (But Smiley Maids refused to repeat the offer, w/a $60 minimum, 2 lady minimum, 2 hr minimum.)"
5,"This is my second review of this company. I continue to be very pleased with the quality of the work performed. We have a dog and two cats. They shed large amounts of hair on the carpet and furniture. Jared gets all the hair vacuumed off the floors, then vacuums the furniture and kitchen chairs. I am amazed at the amount of hair he is able to pick up with his vacuum. He also does a fantastic job cleaning bathrooms, especially giving extra attention to the bathtubs and the tile. We have a recently remodeled bathroom with a new bathtub that had cracked grout along the top edge. It had already begun to grow mold and mildew. Jared surprised me by caulking along the cracked grout lines and cleaning it up so it looked brand new again. He did not charge me for the extra work. Then he did the same thing in an older bathroom and again did not charge me for the extra labor. The bathrooms look great and I am always so pleased with the quality of the work and the attention to detail. I will continue to use Kristina and Jared's Cleaning and Handyman Service bi-monthly. Jared is professional, personable and serious about his work. I am very happy with this company and highly recommend them."
5,"We have had a lot of construction going on including drywall, so we needed a super cleaning with all of the drywall dust. For our first cleaning, Jared sent out a man & woman team. That was a disaster; but Jared cares deeply about keeping a stellar reputation so he personally came out with another man the following week to make things right. Jared says that the former team are no longer with his company. I was pleased with Jared's professionalism."
5,"Jared was very pleasant during the entire phone interview and scheduling. He thought we'd be very pleased with Maria and Pablo, and we were beyond pleased! They are extremely kind and detail oriented. 2100 sq ft home, all tile floors, tile bathrooms and laundry room, and two dogs that never take a break from shedding - most people would have turned and ran, but Maria and Pablo didn't even flinch. We look forward to continuing this relationship with this company and Maria and Pablo!"
5,"Daniel and Jennifer are a wonderful couple and they have done a great job at our place and my Moms. There first trip to our home was about 2 weeks ago, and on there first visit they did a thorough cleaning which took a bit longer (4 hours for our place and 2 hours for my moms). We have dogs and live downtown so dusting is an ongoing problem at my house, by the time they got done our place was shining and lovely, also the cleaning items they use, I think Method does not leave the house smelling like a chemical factory, but instead has a nice clean, almost floral aroma. They came today to do a regular cleaning (2 hours) and again my home smells and looks wonderful. As I mentioned they are a great couple, and they want to make sure you are happy with the service they provide. They also do a great job at my moms, who has Alzheimer's and can sometimes be a challenge to be around. They are both excellent with my mom and just smile and keep answering the same questions over and over again!! I would highly recommend them to any one looking for an excellent cleaning service!!"
5,Jared and Kristina are fantastic. They are extremely organized and are hard working. My house is spotless thanks to them. Not only do they do great work. They are very personable and easy to work with and flexible if anything comes up. I really look forward to the day they come each week
1,My husband and I tried scheduling consultations. They finally returned our call after several attempts. When they did schedule with us they never showed. At first we figured they were busy. The first returned call when finally called was an apology for not returning due to them being out of town with a wedding. We get that life can get in the way. Then he told us he'd call us back to schedule. Never heard from them. We called left a message. You know the rest! I wasted so much time and energy on this. I purposely signed up for Angie's List to look for this service. So disappointed!
5,"I contacted Kristina and Jared's cleaning service about a month ago. I was very impressed with Jared's quick response and got a very good feeling talking to him on the phone. He said they needed to do a 'deep' cleaning the first time they came out. I was a little put out because my home is cleaned on a regular basis and I did not feel that it needed this 'deep' cleaning. He gave me an estimate of $200 which would be 8 hours of cleaning. I decided to proceed with this 'deep' cleaning. When Ashley arrived (10 minutes early) she knew right away that my home would not take 8 hours to 'deep' clean. She got right to work and was done in 5 hours. The company adjusted my estimate accordingly, no questions asked. The second time, Jennifer and Daniel cleaned my home. Once again they came in started work and were very polite. Asking questions on what I wanted done. They left telling me to make sure I let them know what they may have not done and any requests that I may have for next time. I am now scheduled to have my home cleaned bi-weekly."
5,"This is the best cleaning service I have had. They were prompt, had the expertise to see what needed cleaning, and were 100% customer service oriented. I asked about adding the outdoor kitchen and patio area on the first cleaning because we were planning on entertaining. Jared, the owner, and another employee cleaned the area immediately at no cost. Pablo and Maria are my regular cleaners and do a fantastic job with concern about my satisfaction. I give them my highest recommendation which is not typical for me. I can be a little difficult to please. They are the best!"
5,"Jared came by the property and gave me an estimate -- we needed a thorough cleaning of the entire house. They were on time, flexible with instructions, and very customer service oriented. At one point there was a crew of 6 working at the same time, but they got the job done as well as a few unplanned handyman repairs that came up. This company goes above and beyond expectations -- I don't need to look anywhere else. No wonder they were voted Contractor of Year in their category in 2013. It wouldn't surprise me if they repeated it again for this year."
5,"Pablo and Maria were punctual and very thorough. The condo is small but had not been completely cleaned for a while. After they were done, it looked so different. They really cleaned the kitchen, bathroom, the blinds and the fans. The wood floor in the bedroom looked much better after Maria got done with it. They completely cleaned an oven that had become quite dirty. Pablo redid the caulking around the bathtub. It looks great now. I plan to use them again to keep the place looking good."
5,"Pablo and Maria were on time and did a great job. Cleaned home top to bottom in 6 hours. I have 3 flooring types and granite counter tops. House was bright and clean when they finished. Very happy with the results and with Pablo and Maria. Jared returned my initial call within 12 hours and explained the process, pricing and scheduling in detail. Will use this company again.."
5,"Kiki and Ashley can me and spent 3 1/2 hours working with me to deep clean my condo. I have not seen my bathroom and kitchen look this good in years. They were professional, friendly and polite. They were very responsive to my requests and checked with me along the way to make sur I was happy with the service."
5,"contacted Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service as my first cleaning service to ever use. I received an immediate email back with the date available I wanted them to come out for. Jerone Glass arrived several minutes early, was professional, kind and funny. I showed him around my small condo and he got right to work. I left him there several times to run errands. It was their first visit, so, he took his time. I asked him if he could wash the windows, I have two - sometimes 3dogs and they ruin my windows. He not only did a great job on the condo, the windows looked like I left them open! I was so happy! I had to go to work for a couple of hours and left him there to finish and came home to a lovely scented, clean home. I will definitely have this company return. Big plus for me was Jerone and Jared were prior Active Duty Navy, as am I. Jared stayed in close contact with during the visit and was definitely concerned with my satisfaction. I will definitely have them return for regular cleaning."
5,It was a man and his wife that came. They were on time and very thorough.
5,"Our family first used Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service last December. The house was very dirty because it had been more than a year since it had been thoroughly cleaned by a cleaning service. I asked for a deep cleaning and was told it would probably take 5 to 6 hours. Two people came to clean and spent around 4 hours doing the cleaning. After they left, I realized they had missed some places that should have been cleaned and initially felt disappointed. I called and talked to Jared about the problems. He responded immediately by driving over to our house and inspecting the house. He reassured me that he would take care of the next cleaning at no cost to me. I was very impressed by his concern and immediate attention to my complaints. We picked a weekend in January for our next cleaning. Jared came and performed the cleaning himself and did a fabulous job. The cleaning was very thorough and I was really impressed. Jared is also very friendly and personable. I told him I would like to continue having the housecleaning service every two weeks. I am very happy to have Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service as my new permanent housecleaning service provider. They are punctual, professional and friendly. I look forward to a long relationship with this company and know if I have any problems with their services, they will always make it right because of their honesty and integrity."
5,"This is my second review for these guys, and it is simply because I really like their service. We switched about 5 months ago from another housekeeping company to Kristina and Jared, and immediately we saw the difference. We have had them since then on a bi-weekly schedule. We have had different people coming to clean our house from Kristina and Jared, but the last visit was done by Jared and Kiki, and they really made a mark! I have never seen such high professionalism when it comes to cleaning. The house is super clean and fresh. I am very glad we have found them as it is not easy to find a good housekeeping company who knows what 'clean' really means. Thank you guys!!"
5,"Am so incredibly impressed with Maria & Pablo. They were punctual, friendly, professional and did an absolutely incredible job. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend them and definitely plan on using them again. Will make this a regular appointment"
5,"Great. The cleaners are efficient, professional and friendly. They have been patient with my dogs, family traffic and working with my schedule. I have some residual haze from an old cleaner (hubby):) using the wrong product on laminate wood flooring that is gradually going away with each cleaning. They did a great job especially last week when I turned on the whole house fan after the Santa Ana winds, thus sucking in all of the dust. What a mess I made! I have been using this service since April 2014. I feel comfortable with them in my home, and that says a lot."
5,"They're very, very thorough. They cleaned everything and they have excellent attention to what they were doing. They work hard and very diligent with what they're doing so I think it's a fair value of the money. They're very meticulous, very detailed and they get through everything. I have one of these wooden knife holders sitting on the counter and they take every knife out and clean them individually."
5,"It's been about eight months that I have used Kristina and Jared's Cleaning and Handyman Service. They visit about every two weeks. I have been very pleased with their service and their devotion to detail. I was surprised to see a negative review of their service because?for me?not only have they been personable but consistently have done an excellent job and are always open to suggestion (and have needed to phone?only once?when unforeseen events required a change in the arrival for a visit). I would still award their service an ""A."""
5,"Jared sent a couple who work for him, Maria and her husband. I intend to call them again. Attention to my needs and did great job."
3,"I wish I knew. It took me 2-3 days to even schedule them to come out, and then they completely blew me off until I called multiple times with threats of writing bad reviews. I took off the day of work to be home to have this taken care of, so I was really put out. If they really did have a car accident as stated, a business should have a backup plan for allowing ""business as usual"" to continue despite setbacks. Maybe inform your workers the day before instead of an hour before they are supposed to show up, so that if emergencies occur it's not a big deal. Just a thought."
5,"It went very well. I was very pleased with Pablo and Maria. We had some ceiling repair work done so the whole house was very dusty. Don't think my house has ever been this clean. Just wanted to get back with further review. Pablo and Maria came for the 3rd time today and I just love them. If they are an example of all the crews that Kristina and Jered send out you need to check them out. I have had many housekeeping services over the years and they take the cake. There is not a way to give them an A+ but would if I could. They are prompt and so professional. They know how to really clean a home. My family feel so comfortable with them in the house and I will have them come every week for a loooong time!! My puppy dog that normally will bark at a new man walking in the house welcomed him with open paws. Thanks Kristina and Jered for making my life so wonderful. When Pablo and Maria leave, I know I have not thrown my $$ away."
5,They are wonderful! They are very flexible and are careful not to disturb my husband. I really appreciate their exceptional service and would recommend their services to others!
5,"It went great! Jared was completely trustworthy and extremely helpful when we were in a situation where we couldn't get to our home. We knew our smoke detector alarms batteries were bad because we could hear the annoying beeping noise they make through our video alarm system! We needed to find someone we could trust for emergency situations like this to help us out in a bind. We talked to Jared, and he immediately put us at ease and said he'd be happy to help! I was of course nervous giving a stranger a key to our home, but it turns out Jared is now on our trust list! We mailed him the key, along with some batteries, and he took care of our problem as soon as he got the mail. He even called us when he was heading into our place as we requested. We will definitely be doing business with Jared more in the future!! Maybe a paint job next? We shall see, but we will definitely continue building our relationship with Jared and Kristina! I would absolutely recommend them!! Thanks Again!"
5,It was exactly what I was looking for!!!!!!
5,"They were both very nice, professional and listened to my requests. I intend to use their services on an occasional basis and more regularly once I have a monthly budget!"
5,"They're very thorough and willing to work with me on timing. The prices are a little high, but that might be because of the area. I do think I'm getting what I paid for."
5,"We have been using Kristina and Jared's cleaning service for about 8-9 months now. Jared cleans for us twice a month, and always does a wonderful job. I have asked for a few ""extra"" items to be cleaned, and some window screens installed. Jared always cheerfully will help us out with our requests. I trust Jared completely with my home and items. He is very honest and trustworthy. We love Kristina and Jared, and will be keeping them for as long as they are available! Bob and Trish Christiansen"
5,"Jared answered the phone personally, listened carefully and understood the problem, knew that he could not do the job, and gave me a referral to someone he believes can do it. This response and knowledge is valuable enough to me that I wanted to write a review."
5,"We recently hired Kristina and Jared to do a floor-to-ceiling cleanup after having our home remodeled. With plenty of dirt, grime and sawdust everywhere, and me being, admittedly, very picky about cleaning, it wasn't an easy job. Based on the list I gave them, they decided to bring extra help, and they worked away for at least half a day?floors, counters, bathrooms, windows, carpets?I even asked them to clean the tracks of the sliding glass doors. They did everything I asked efficiently, enthusiastically and with a smile. They went out of their way to make sure I was completely satisfied with the job. When I had concerns about some streaks remaining on the windows, they re-did all the windows and glass doors. When I asked about a film that seem to remain on the new flooring, Jared explained to me that he believed this was normal and would take a few cleanings to dissipate. Nonetheless, he re-mopped the floors again for me, just to be sure I was happy (I think they mopped them at least three or four times!) Bottom line is, great job, great attitude, nice people!"
5,"Jamie and Chris came on time and worked for 5 hours and made our house very clean. We just moved into this house and have had a lot of contractors in and out. Also, we were tired of the inconsistency of the quality of the work and the personnel the previous housekeepers we had had for 1,5 years (who have received quite good reviews here). After reading the reviews about Kristina and Jared's housekeeping services, I contacted Jared and got today's cleaning. They are very professional, very courteous, and did an excellent job! I am very glad with the result and I am looking forward to the future services by them."
5,They did it professionally and with a smile. I would highly recommend their service and I plan to use them in the future.
5,"I needed their service to clean a rental unit. Wonderful, wonderful service. The cleaning was perfect and they could not have been more courteous. I will definitely use them again."
5,"Jamie & Jake showed up at the time requested and brought equipment & supplies. They made sure to find out my priorities and my ""dos & don'ts"". They moved furniture and gave the area rug a good, thorough vacuuming. We have a dog & cat so this is extremely important! I explained that the floors (mostly wood & tile) were my pet peeves if not done well. Nothing looks clean if the floors are only half done. Absolutely no complaints. They even got the hard water stains off the granite in the bathroom. Thorough, professional and good humored (an extra bonus) the whole time. Hoping to see them back very soon! (The dog is shedding profusely with all this warm weather.....)."
5,Very satisfied with their work and would recommend them highly.
5,Outstanding work! Came for the second time and we were very happy with the results. My wife was skeptical at first but has been LOVING it. Very reasonably priced. We have a 3/2 1200sq ft home. Both times he arrived promptly which is a big deal to me. Kristina & Jared both followed up with me after the first visit and wanted to ensure that everything went smooth. Well run business that takes pride in service!
5,"Let me preface by saying that I normally never write reviews, but the service provided by Kristina and Jareds went above and beyond all my expectations. They showed up on time and not only were they extremely thorough and reasonable in cost, I have never seen a company that is that professional and personable at the same time. They turned a townhome that looked like a disaster zone from renovations into a model home. Jared and his crew were the most hardworking group of individuals I have met and Kristina is so personable and helpful. I had to reschedule my original cleaning time and they were more than happy to accomodate my request. Furthermore, Jared even returned a couple days later to help me troubleshoot an appliance problem. This is a company that makes me feel proud to be an American. Thnx again guys."
5,"Kristina and Jared are professional, efficient and overall great cleaners! They courteously take the time to listen to my cleaning particulars and then execute those particulars. :-) I have had several cleaners this past year and let all of them go due to their lack of professionalism, tardiness or terrible cleaning jobs. I don't ever want to be without Kristina & Jared as they are not only very on top of their job but are all around helpful, kind and just plan good people that you want to know!"
5,"The service was outstanding. They were absolutely great. They were very thorough, very careful, very nice people, they did a really great and cleaned everything."
5,I would highly recommend Kristina & Jareds company for any type of cleaning job inside the home and/or outside yard clean up. They have a great attitude. Their prices are very reasonable.
5,"Excellent cleaning, responsiveness, and timeliness. I tried to explain the size of my house and that there was recent remodeling dust. They sent a two person team and quickly expanded it to four to complete the job on my schedule even though they stayed until 7 pm. We're looking forward to their return after our move in and unpacking!"
5,Very thorough first time cleaning
5,"They were amazing. Jared and Chris showed up right on time at 10:00am. We walked thru the house and I showed them what I wanted done. They got right to work. I couldn't stay the entire time, but when I got home the house was sparkling! My house had not been cleaned professionally for over 2 years, and I was actually embarassed by how many dust bunnies there were. My hardwood floors were 5-7 shades lighter, all my grout in the bathrooms and kitchen was clean, the shower and tub gleamed. My 36"" stainless steel stove was shiny, the oven cleaned, all the counters clean,clean, clean. Initially they were only able to work to 3pm, as they had another client. I got a call from Jared saying he rescheduled the other client (sorry) because he just couldn't leave the house half done. they stayed til 6pm to finish. I am so pleased with this service. I have signed up for bi-weekly cleaning and look forward to having Chris come clean again. Jared is very pleasant and professional."
5,"So quickly, so completely, and so pleasantly, that I couldn't believe it! I highly reccomend them!!"
5,"Kristina and Jared are great! They cleaned our home in a very thorough and professional manner: dusting, ceiling fans, counter tops and flooring. They have been arriving on time and complete their work very efficiently. The products that they bring and use seem to really work, leaving the rooms with a very fresh scent. We highly recommend this team"
5,Jared and Kristina are very good at listening to your requests and cleaning your home the way you want/need it to be cleaned. I appreciated their willingness to hear my needs and address them.
5,"It went really well! Kristina and Jared spent the whole day completing the cleaning and left the house in spectacular shape. Sinks, dishwasher, blinds, bathtub et al, looked brand new. The move-out inspection went really well and the agent commented on how great the house looked. I couldn't be happier with the results. Thanks!"
5,"We were on a tight schedule to move from our condo in University City, and needed to know that our cleaners would leave the place perfect. Kristina and Jared adjusted their schedule for us after our movers were late, and Kristina and Jared did a spectacular job. We had two large glass enclosures on showers that were perfect when they finished detailing them. We had teak hardwood floors and they cleaned them to perfection. We had granite countertops and they were beautifully cleaned. They took care of details we would not have thought of, and were professional and considerate. We can't recommend them enough!"
5,"PLEASE. DO NOT HIRE KRISTINA AND JARED. We don't want to lose them. They are a delightful couple who have the hardworking, pride-in-doing-a-good-job that one sees too infrequently these days. They are smart, communicative, pay attention to detail and remember and honor special requests with great care. Somehow, they manage to combine these attributes with such an easy-going disposition that, despite our very private natures, we are quite comfortable with them in our home. They consistently make every effort to go above and beyond expectations while even taking moments here and there to interact with our granddaughter and dogs. They are so gracious they're actually amused when our dog attacks their mop. They make every effort to schedule timely service and are super responsive with returning calls/texts. We've had them help with special projects including washing windows, jambs and screens that hadn't been washed in the almost two years since we bought the house, plus who knows how many more years. Clean windows can make a house shine; the windows sparkled when they were done. As an added bonus, it was cute watching them work together on the windows--Kristina on the inside, Jared on the outside, pointing out spots to each other. My husband is 100% disabled combat veteran and we are have our 10-month old granddaughter in our home. Jared is available to help with my ""honey do"" list, which is so incredibly valuable to me. The list is long, so for now we have just worked on prioritizing projects and starting with one thing at a time. I have a lot of remodeling experience and know that Jared has a solid understanding of the work required with each different project. Further, I can see the same pride in doing a good job with regard to his handyman services. So, please. Don't hire them. I really need them. And, I had them first."
5,Great job done
3,This cleaning was ok.
5,"Went well, thanks!"
5,Very well. they were very through.
5,Excellent.
5,It went well.
5,Excellent service provided
5,They were great!
5,Great work. Very professional
5,The two cleaners were excellent.
5,"Kristina and Jared did a deep clean that left my house looking, smelling and feeling pristine. It was also a heroic job as they came in the middle of our unusual heat wave, and I don't have air conditioning. They are the most professional and the nicest, most genuine cleaners I have ever used (in over 30 years in three different countries as well as three different U.S. states!). They take so much pride in their work that you know you are getting your money's worth. I would definitely use them again and would recommend them to friends."
5,They were very professional. Cleaned all of the house including blinds and fan blades. They cleaned inside of cabinets and drawers. The house was very clean when they left.
5,"I really only expected to get an estimate but since it had been a couple weeks (or more) since things were cleaned, the housecleaning was welcomed. Also, as I said, their rate was only slightly higher than I had been paying but their friendliness, professionalism, attention to detail, etc. was well worth it The advantage was having both a woman and man/handyman present so things went much faster and tasks that weren't really ""house cleaning"" were not problematic (an broadens the scope of problems that can be addressed). I realize that we both have a learning curve ahead of us so it will take several visits to learn each others preferences."
5,"Jared and Kristina are an amazing duo. I chose them because we were moving out of our rental and needed both cleaning and handiwork. They came and did a meticulous job getting the house prepared for painting, repairing holes, replacing shelving, and more. They worked diligently and thoroughly. I will certainly use them again!"
5,"Both Kristina and Jared are very nice, personable and professional. They arrived promptly and asked how I wanted things done. They were very open to any suggestions and were very understanding about how our home is set up due to disabled members of our family. Our house had not been cleaned in a long time and they took their time and did a thorough job. Even as they worked, they took the time to come and ask me my preferences on cleaning certain things. I have terrible sinus allergies and many cleaning products give me headaches. Kristina and Jared used non-offensive products and when the shower required a stronger cleaner, they made certain to open windows and turn on the fan for me. They even noticed the high levels of dust and recommended my filters needed to be checked. With my permission, they checked the filters and replaced one that was overdue for a replacement. They also had no problems with my dogs too. I'm VERY satisfied with the job they did and have scheduled them to come back."
5,"Professional, trustworthy, effective, and reliable! Jared and Kristina bring high quality workmanship to housecleaning. They beam with motivation and take great deal of pride in doing high quality work. They have been on time every time and have worked hard from the second they walk through the door. They clean every corner and find things I would have missed ? they even cleaned the AC filters and replaced the battery in a dying smoke alarm. They are fast and they do a fantastic job! I don?t know what kind of cleaning products they use, but my house smells AMAZING when they leave! They are both very sweet and down to earth. A very nice and hardworking couple who seem to genuinely enjoy their work. Although I am a private person, I am very comfortable having them in my home. They are great with animals - I have an cat who is an escape artist and they are impeccable about keeping doors shut and not letting him out. I really appreciate their flexibility. I needed someone who could come in the evening and they were more than happy to arrange evening appointments ? a huge plus!"
5,"Kristina and Jared were able to schedule their services to meet my needs and showed up on time and worked completely to my satisfaction to get my rental home ready for the new tenants. Jared pulled nails out of the walls, patched sanded and did touch up painting in all the rooms. Kristina started by tackling the kitchen and all the appliances. They hung the freshly cleaned draperies and repaired the traveler mechanism. Windows sparkled inside and out when they were painstakingly washed. Both bathrooms were scrubbed and sanitized. Nothing was left in the corners. Custom cabinetry was thoroughly vacuumed, cleaned, and polished. Tile flooring was swept, then vacuumed and then mopped. Kristina and Jared accomplish in a full day what would have take others much longer to accomplish. They are a very pleasant young couple with admirable work ethic and high standards. They ensured that I was satisfied with all that they accomplished. I would not hesitate to use them again and recommend them to others."
5,"For many years I had one of my best friends clean my apartment. She?s a perfectionist and, although I knew I was lucky to have her, it wasn?t until she moved away that I realized how lucky I was. I?ve tried several cleaning services in the past few years. Lazy and apathetic describes most of the people coming to clean. Although some have been very nice and respectful, if you?re not a good cleaner willing to work hard and fast, what?s the point? Now, thanks to Angie?s List, I?ve found Karen and Jared. They showed up on time. They?re easy to talk to and hard working. It?s obvious they?re passionate about their job, showing an attention to detail as if they were cleaning their own apartment. With other services, I was surprised to find one thing after another missed or not done right after they were done and gone. Not with Karen and Jared. There work was perfect and I?ll be using them from now on. Thanks, Angie?s List."
5,"Kristina and Jered did a phenomenal job. We've used two cleaning services in the past before using Kristina and Jered including one that was highly rated with Angie's List who won one of those Band of Neighbor awards and ""Award of Excellence"". We got a deep cleaning and one routine cleaning through this service. While the deep cleaning was fine, the routine cleaning was not up to par. We live in a two-story house and the kitchen was not clean. Floors were still dirty. It was a mess. We did not get very good customer service through that group despite my trying for two weeks and given them the benefit of the doubt. That is when I found Kristina and Jered again through Angie's List and they have exceeded our expectations. We are very pleased with them and they were better than the cleaning service that won those awards. They are professional and courteous and pay attention to detail and want to make sure that expectations are met. They are so much better than the prior cleaning service that won all those awards and was recognized by Angies List. I would highly recommend them."
5,"After having a deep clean of our home, we asked Kristina and Jared to schedule regular cleanings. They are a delightful, personable young couple who work really well together. We instantly felt at home with them. They are professional, punctual, courteous, hard workers and self starters! We feel very comfortable leaving our home to them. Their attention to detail is incredible! Their work leaves things not just clean, but sparkling. I have been amazed with what they have done! When the windows were done, it looked as if the panes had been removed, they were so clean! They always go above and beyond what would be expected. For example, one day I had just unloaded the drier and clean clothes were on the bed. When we returned from the doctor appt., the clothes were neatly folded. Having a seriously ill person in the home has brought out their kindness and consideration as well. It is obvious they are very caring and thoughtful. The use of green products has been very helpful and leaves such a nice smell. In addition to the outstanding housekeeping, Jared is also a handyman and has noticed and offered to repair things: caulking in the bathroom, repairing a skylight, clearing off leaves and twigs off our flat roof. Everything Kristina and Jared have done has been outstanding and amazing! We have tried two other housecleaning services previously which we thought were acceptable at the time, but there is no comparison to the work Kristina and Jared have done! They truly are a godsend to us!"
5,"We actually enjoyed having Jared and Kristina come to our apartment. They were extremely pleasant to be around, and they worked very well together. They pointed out areas where we needed to call in the landlord for some repairs, such as a leaking/running toilet, and were very helpful in giving us some solutions to some of our ongoing issues. When it turned out that they would be late for our appointment, they kept in touch with us so we would know when to expect them, and they finished within the four-hour time period that we had been quoted. Thanks so much, Jared and Kristina!"
5,"Fantastic. Kristina and Jared were very friendly and flexible on the phone in discussing what we were looking for in a cleaning service for my parents house. We scheduled a day and time within a few days. They showed up on time and just were just as friendly and flexible in person. They asked what we wanted done, made some recommendations and got to work. They worked quickly but didn't hurry, and took care that everything was sparkling clean and put back into place. Their work is great, they're easy to work with, and we couldn't be more pleased. We scheduled regular cleaning before they left."
5,They were very conscientious and treated the project as if they were painting and fixing their own home. They worked tirelessly until the job was done!
5,"I have been using Kristina and Jared for several months and am very pleased with their service. They are timely and will text or call if they are running early or late. They are friendly and efficient and seem very detail oriented. They are accommodating to our partially remodeled home (newer half much easier to clean than older half). I have tried many services and individual housekeepers over the years and am very comfortable with them in my home and have no concerns having them here while I'm away. I am interested in my house being truly clean - behind doors, behind furnishings (occasionally obviously), dusted ceiling corners, etc. I like having Kristina and Jared because they understand I would rather pay for a little more time and have them do a little deeper cleaning rather than a superficial dusting with carefully folded towels."
5,"Kristina and Jared arrived on time, asked specific questions about how I wanted things done and finished within the projected time. They provided great attention to detail and did an excellent job. They even went above and beyond on little things, like putting my dirty sheets in the washer and dryer before they left. I was very comfortable leaving them alone in my home and would recommend them highly, without reservation!"
5,Perfect outcome.
5,It went well.
5,They did a good job.
5,Their work was excellent.
5,see above
5,See above review box.
4,"We were referred to Doug Canada by a friend for whom he had made and installed custom cabinets/drop zone near their kitchen. We were pleased with Doug's thorough and professional manner. He was very amenable to working with our special requests. As for the carpentry portion of it, I couldn't be happier. Considering the age of house and the level of difficulty, I was very impressed with Doug's skill. The door was properly hung and closes in perfect alignment. The weather stripping, threshold, exterior and interior trim are flawless. We did some staining ourselves because we wanted to use two different colors to highlight the carving, but the contractor finished the interior side, the second coat and the polyurethane sealer. There were some surprises on the job; for example, the contractor had to remove a row of brick header in order for the door to fit (for some reason the opening is shorter than the standard). Later, we had a minor delay and misunderstanding over the staining: who was going to do what and whether or not the original quote would cover the labor cost. However, the issue was handled with honesty and professionalism and we were able to work it out to both our satisfaction. The only reason I am not giving the job an excellent rating is because I had to touch up some of the stain and poly each night, plus scrape the windows. Ideally, the job could have been a little bit neater. However, we were still more than satisfied with the overall performance and the price/value. We would definitely recommend this contractor."
5,Arrived at the specified time and completed changing my shower heads expeditiously! He has completed other jobs for me as well.
2,Vic was nice enough when he did the job but there’s a gap in one transition and on another the adhesive didn’t work. Touch ups were scheduled and blown off numerous times and now i cannot get a response
1,Vic abandoned the project after payment was made. Would not recommend as a contractor.
5,"Victor was professional and dependable. He provided excellent communications, fast response and timely service. He was very easy to work with"
1,Owner Victor Womack took my deposit and never performed the work. He has not returned my calls or texts messages. Had to file a civil case against him and his company.
5,"Fantastic! Quick and clear communication from the start. Showed up on time, explained the work that was needed, and worked efficiently. Very professional and courteous. Would definitely contact Prop Flipper for future work needed."
5,The job went very well. He was very thorough and paid attention to details during the job. I was very satisfied.
5,He solved my problems in a jiffy. Great knowledgable worker. Thanks
5,Excellent! Vic was awesome and very professional. Definitely will hire again and refer to friends and family
5,amazing service!
5,It was good. They were affordable. Everyone was professional.
5,Great work
5,"It was very good, and done in a timely manner! The pricing was uncomparible, and so professional! He cleaned up very good behind himself"
4,Very well..remodel turned out nice. I’m satisfied.
5,"He was very professional, meticulous and cleaned up after, which I appreciated because I’ve had some contractors in to do work and had to clean up their messes. He also took the time to explain the process to me before starting."
5,"Vic was great, he’s very professional and completed work in a timely fashion. He called back days later to make sure everything was still working fine and I invited him back out to do more work. Good help is hard to find so I will be keeping Vic on sped dial for future project!"
5,Excellent!! Fast and friendly.
2,"Did not go well. Oscar was very disrespectful on phone and in person, in more than one conversations. He also added $150 after originally quoting me. In the end, he completed the project, but refused to send me pictures. I was out of town and had to send someone else to take pictures of completed work to send to HOA. I paid $50 less than others, but I guess you get what you pay for. I would rather work with someone who takes more money but is professional and courteous. I do not recommend Oscar's company."
1,Horrible he gave me a price on Saturday then came to do the job on Wednesday and renegotiate the price because of materials then tried to use old rotten wood I told him to leave
3,"They did a fair job. However, I will continue my search for my next handyman job."
5,"Oscar and his contractors were prompt, they completed the job to satisfaction and left a clean workspace. They repaired/replaced trim in all of the entryways on my main level. They also installed a storm door to my front door. They were very careful in their work. I would certainly hire them to do more work in my home."
5,Perfect! A dream come true. Installed the side door to the back of house. Now I look out over my yard with joy and admiration. During this change Oscar and his team insulated the entire side of house. OMG the room is so much warmer. Thanks a million! from Arneda B.
5,"Very good quality of work. Great crew, punctual and he was an honest guy."
5,"I had him do a work at my house, and he did a very good job. Very professional and a very nice person to work with. I would totally recommend him and would call him again if I need more work to be done."
5,Perfect! Very professional and precise. Cleaned up and presented the deck I dreamed of. On schedule too. Thanks again
5,It went very good although I had to wait for the replacement several months due to an erroneous delivery of window. Otherwise the work was excellent!
5,"Oscar. Does good work at a reasonable price. He has done small handyman work and large improvements and renovations. Will hire him agai,n."
5,"Very well, especially in bad conditions."
5,Frank was on time and professional. He had the job done in less than an hour. Excellent job well done. Anne went out of her way to remain in contact until my job was scheduled. She provided great and quick service. Thank you so much.
5,"I had a problem on garage sinking at the back, he was able raise the roof a bit and was able to change the board and while doing the replacement of the boards he saw chipmunks nest in side the wall, so he put a reinforced 6 inch wide backboard on the base to keep the chipmunks from coming back. And on the Back Porch, he installed new strom door on and put a new light as well, he also stained the porch and the picnic table and it was excellent, he did everything I wanted him to do and and he did it well."
5,He does a good job and I highly recommend him to everybody
1,I requested a quote from them 2 times. There has been absolutely no response. Nothing to indicate that they would or could do the job. If they called today I would not hire them. NO RESPONSE.
1,"Called 3 times, receptionist was very nice, but no one would ever get back to me. They won’t come out to look at a job, you have to email them pictures hoping someone will get back to you. I waited a week and no one ever got back to me."
5,Did everything I need and done it quickly. Reasonable price. They work fast and do a great job. I get the same guy every time. Great with details.
5,We're happy with the service and we've been using them for years now.
5,"Very good. Chris was punctual, friendly and professional ! We will have him back for future projects"
2,Never showed up to estimate or return calls
5,excellent. I had used them for years.
5,They helped me out in a pinch. Husband had a hip replacement and we realized we did not have the proper stair railings to help him go up and down the stairs. They came out quickly and installed the extra railings we needed. Matched the new railings shape to the existing railings and cleaned up afterwards
2,"The initial visit was fine: I had a good vibe that the man who visited to assess the job was knowledgeable and trustworthy. He said he didn't know they were still doing this kind of work but would take it back to the shop and someone would contact me with pricing and timing. After 5 days I recalled the number, spoke to a woman and told her I'd gotten no response. She said she'd contact Mr. Handyman and have someone call me. I never got a call either pricing or refusing the job. I rated them a B on punctuality because of the initial contact and a D on professionalism because no one ever followed up. I understand the job may have been something they didn't want to do, that's fine. But, if they can't even call a prospect to refuse the job (their right to do so) why would I ever call them again to become a customer?"
5,The person did an excellent job on the walls. You can no longer tell they were separated.
5,"I received a phone call from their office telling me that my handyman was picking up some materials for the job and would be a few minutes late. He was, literally, only a few minutes late. He wasted no time setting up his equipment and immediately went to work. The quality of his work was excellent. Halfway through this project I asked him to do some additional work installing a French Cleat system in my basement work area. He agreed, but indicated that he would have to go pick up some more material. That trip took very little time and he returned and finished the job expeditiously. The whole project was completed within their original time estimates (including the additional French Cleat system) and the only differential in cost was for the additional materials. We were very pleased with Mr. Handyman and we are thinking of several more projects he can do in the future."
5,"Mr Handyman was prompt, professional and neat. Jim showed up, assessed the situation and made the necessary repairs and cleaned up. I have 2 more projects and I will not hesitate to contact Mr Handyman in the future."
5,"All of the techs that were sent for the variety of jobs we were having done were very professional, did very good quality work, solved some challenges with our old house that required creative solutions, were very quick to start work, communicated very well throughout the project. We had a great experience with the team and will definitely hire them again for future projects."
5,"Great, on time, very courteous. Hardly knew they were here until they showed me the well finished project."
5,The repair man was on time courteous and professional . The work was completed quickly and properly. He made suggestions that made the project better. He cleaned up afterwards .
5,"Very well. Barbara was a wonderful receptionist and took all my many messages and took all the details down and shared them with the workers. Excellent communication was handled with all involved. Also, James was the worker who came out and he did an excellent job. I was so pleased that he knew immediately that the cupboard doors could be moved up so they would open after a refrigerator had been put in. Plus he fixed our swinging door so it would work next time better, when we need to take it off. He tried it out once to make sure it would work. I was very pleased with both people I worked with from this company and would highly recommend."
5,"I am always pleased with their work. Thus, I continue to call them for other small tasks that I cannot do. The communication with Mr. Handyman is very good regarding scheduling, any delays, and desired specifics about how you want the job done (or any needed hardware)."
5,He fixed our patio door that got pushed off its track and showed me what to do if it happened again. Would definitely use them again.
5,Terrific from the price quoting phase to the final installation including providing insurance documentation and W-9.
5,It went well. The technicican showed up in the morning. I let him in. He was done and sent me my bill by noon. The work was well done and clean
5,"Mr. Handyman is an awesome service for so many reasons. I'm sure different people use it for different reasons, but personally, I'm a small business owner who is renovating a house, and it's a lot to manage without help. Prioritizing things like small repairs and assembling furniture is extremely difficult for me, and it's so valuable to have a resource like Mr. Handyman who I know will come to my home exactly when they say they will and just get it done right. It's really different from hiring your run-of-the-mill contractor because you know exactly who you're getting, and they have a repeatable methodology for customer service and project execution. You will never experience a late handyman, a lack of professionalism, or a job poorly done--it's just not how they do things. They're also really transparent about quoting and billing, so you know exactly what you'll pay.I know that any of their staff would be knowledgeable and skilled, so you're safe with anyone. I do have to mention, though, that I am so thankful to have found Dan. He is an excellent handyman and person. I have been so absolutely happy with his service, he does everything beautifully and goes way out of his way to make sure everything is done the way I want it. He is professional, considerate, and makes it clear that his main concern is making sure I'm satisfied, plus I'm pretty sure there's nothing he can't do."
5,"Nice job ! , very pleased . Nick was the installer , very nice , organized , cleaned as worked , and made sure he looked over the area not to leave any debris ."
5,"It went great. They did it while I was at work and I always get a little nervous when I'm not there to clarify any questions the contractors might have. However, they did everything perfectly and I feel they even went above and beyond my request in getting the vinyl siding nailed down and secure."
5,Very quick to come and give estimate and quick to complete the project.
5,It was great. They responded to my inquiry the same day and sent a technician out the following day to quote the project. I accepted the quote on Friday and he did the work on Monday. Jon was polite and worked efficiently and cleaned up after the job was done. The final cost was well within the quoted price.
5,everything was done promptly and under the estimate
5,Its under new management and its even better than it used to be.
5,"In each project, I found Mr. Handyman to be reasonable priced and their technician Jim was very professional. I am pleased with the overall result of each project and would definitely use them again in the future"
5,Good job prompt and took no time at all
5,"Trying to find a contractor to do small jobs can be a real challenge. This company has outstanding responsiveness, completed the job quickly and does excellent work. Hence, A's in all categories."
5,On time and we're very professional
2,No work was performed since no one contacted me.
5,"The technician (James) was personable, knowledgeable, and aimed for perfection in his work. All aspects of the job were completed at a high level of quality -- the replacement fascia boards above my front door were especially challenging and were done perfectly. I was also impressed with the speed at which the work was executed. The communications from the home office were also excellent and helped to keep me informed throughout the process. I'm glad to have found a reliable option for this type of work in the future -- finding a good contractor is always a challenge."
5,Excellent. He was really nice and he did a good job. He put a tarp down. Very good. They did the job the same day they came out to give me an estimate. They were right on time. He was very good. Definitely use again.
4,"The work got done, though it was completed by someone with little experience in these areas. They did come back and fix the problems I noticed, so in the end it was ok."
5,Wonderful! Technician Nick came out and repaired my deck and did an excellent job and was done in 2 hours and it was very affordable
5,"He did some work, a couple of jobs for me, about an year ago. I was fine with him. Two was a little bathroom window. One is a bay window. Three separate windows. They must have misunderstand me, and we got it straighten out. So, they replaced the two windows in the middle, and as they were doing the work outside, they called me outside one day, and wanted to show me something. If I had only had an window company come in, and changed the windows, I probably would have not had happened. When they started pulling off the trim of the window, they noticed in the bay, the insulation pretty much was gone. So, I told them to go ahead and do the work. They pull off everything else, and my house has been cold a long time, but there was virtually no insulation in there. So, they found it, and with my permission, they padded up all,sealed it all up with insulation, and did wood trim on the outside, and they did a great job."
5,"I had a handle where the lock part wasn't working anymore. I didn't like the handle to begin with. I asked if they was going to be time to repair that if it was going to be possible to replace all that and I tried to specify what kind of handle I really wanted, not the original one that came with the door. I was very happy. That's all I can say. Now I don't pinch myself I open the screen door. I never have them come out for just one item. I want to say it was a paint job. These are really simple jobs. Touch up jobs inside."
5,"Have used before. They do good work. Usually they charge by the hour and then I pay for the part they had to buy. It's usually a set rate. They couldn't get me just the deadbolt alone. We had to get the set with the deadbolt with the handle. My daughter said something the other day, said she couldn't get it open very well. I'm watching to see if that's going to be a problem. I try to make sure I have enough things for them to do for the whole hour so you get your money's worth."
5,They are down in my book as the people I turn to because I've been happy with their services all the time.
4,"The price seems pretty fair. On bigger jobs they send two people but most times just one. I've had a pretty good experience, they've done a lot better then the people I used before."
5,"very well, they were extremely professional, showed up on time and were done before i knew it. didn't think it would make that much of a difference, but now im almost too hot, so i took my shirt off"
5,"Dan was the technician and he was so friendly and clearly knew what he was doing. My fencing had some damage and I was worried about my dogs getting out, Mr. Handyman made an appointment promptly and Dan arrived on time and finished quickly. Not only did he fix my fencing, but when he was done he fixed other areas of my fencing that needed some work! This puts my mind at ease with my dogs and I am so happy I chose Mr. Handyman. Thank you for your quick and above and beyond work!"
5,"Great service with Nick and Mr Handyman. He arrived right on-time, was professional, polite and did a great job. Completed all of my projects (including fan assembly and removal) very quickly and without issue. Will absolutely be hiring them again."
5,"I am a Dan fan...big time! He works really fast, cleans up, eager to help and do a job right. He seems to ask himself how he could do a job differently to save me money. Dan the Handyman is a great help to me."
2,"Three business days before my scheduled appointment of June 21, 2016 they called and cancelled. Jim from Mr. Handyman gave no reason other than they couldn't do it at this time. I had a door jamb that was broke and the door was not lockable so I pleaded for them to please just do that one for safety. He agreed and sent someone over on June 21, 2106. they had given me an estimate $457.00 and 4 hours to replace/repair the jamb and $50 in materials. The worker arrived at 12:45 and left at 2:45 and left for 1/2 hour during that time to get material he had forgot. They charged me the $457.00. I spoke to Mike at Mr. Handyman on July 13th at 10:00 a.m. to discuss why they had not called me to schedule the work on the other two doors. He said Jim had said I cancelled the other two jobs, which I did not. At that time I discussed the cost of the door jamb with labor at $200 per hour (one man). He said the labor includes costs for the time it takes to get to the job as well as the time it took him to come out and do an estimate of the job several weeks earlier. I let him know that this does not seem appropriate as they did not do the rest of my job and they obviously did an abbreviated job on this door jamb since it only took half of the time he estimated. He agreed to refund $100 of the $457.00 I had paid and call me back to schedule the remaining jobs they cancelled after he looked at his schedule. . It is now September 1st and I have never heard from him and never received the $100 refund."
1,Never called back and never showed up. FAIL.
5,"Did a great job on a project that many other companies wouldn't even touch. Great communication. Did what they said they would do, when they said they would do it, and charged what they said it would cost. Would definitely use again and would recommend to others."
3,Problem was solved to my satisfaction and raised the grade to a C
5,"Michael Fay and his team just completed a third job for me within the last 9 months. These guys show up on time, work quickly and efficiently, and do quality work. I have found them to be quite knowledgeable about a diversity of construction related matters. They have handled well complex problems that came up during the first two jobs completed for me. The first job entailed replacing wood that had rotted over several years due to faulty construction -- water had been leaking through siding -- and required the replacement of structural materials in the garage. The situation was much worse than what we suspected before the guys began the job. They did a fine job for what I considered to be a fair price. They next remodeled the kitchen. We chose to keep the original cabinents. When the granite installers showed up they discovered that some of the cabinents were not in shape to support the countertops and the cabinents had not been installed properly some 20 years previous. Michael offered to rebuild the cabinents with quality plywood -- removing the cheap pressboard material used when these things were manufactured. This saved us a lot of money and several weeks of pain that would have come with having a kitchen ripped up while waiting for new cabinents to arrive. They did great work also with laying tile and grouting for the back of the countertops. Michael and team have shown themselves to be honest and quite skilled in doing many different kinds of work. They have skills far beyond what I envision when i hear the word ""handyman."" I would recommend anyone in the Cleveland area to at least get a quote from Michael Fay when considering a home repair or upgrade."
1,"The experience went wrong when they didn't paint the walls carefully. Painted an entire door upstairs including the latch. They left stains all over the walls. They said racial slurs to me concerning hot sauce. The doors to the bathroom and laundry rooms were only painted on one side. The guy was getting angry and felt like I was trying to tell him how to do his job. They were upset that they had to correct their mistakes. I kept informing him that I would be trying to sell my house, and trying to get top dollar for it. Was getting angry that we were informing him of where things needed to be corrected. Informed him that there was a product that could remove the stains he had left. He began to apply the stain remover after I noticed the stains."
5,Very professional and friendly. Performed requested repairs timely and did an excellent job. Work area was immaculate when they left.
5,Installer arrived on time and went right to work. He removed the old door and installed the door I bought at a local box store. He keep the work area clean and took the old door with him. He also filled the gaps in the door frame with insulation. The price didn't seem out of line and I will be calling Mr. Handyman in the future.
5,The workmanship was excellent. No complaints.
5,"I am totally thrilled. I have been unable to open my front door since painting was done over a year ago. Several of my male friends had attempted to open the door, without success. Nick spent less than ten minutes and had the door open. When I commented that he must be really strong, he told me that he worked smart, not strong. He told me even though I had left the door open for twelve hours after painting, the paint continued to cure and it had adhered to the weather stripping. If I had remembered to open the door the next day after painting, I would have been all right. The door opens more easily now than it has in years. Nick opened my side door in even less time than the front door. He replaced a screw in the top hinge with a longer screw. He told me that the problem with that door is the door frame is not totally square because the foundation is no longer level. He told me that even though the door looks crooked in the frame, it will no longer rub at the top corner because the longer screw holds it in place. Before he left, Nick told me that if I use the company again, I should make a list of all of the things I want done to fill up the time, since they charge by the hour. Even though Nick had completed the job in about a half hour, I was more than happy to write my check because he very efficiently did what my brawny friends were unable to do. Nick was friendly and professional and definitely knew what he was doing."
5,"They are?still doing work for us. They get here, do the job, and if they run into any trouble they work through it."
2,"Since I have never received the written estimate of costs, I would say this was a waste of time having him come over to measure my door."
2,"After I approved the quote for the first property and the work did not start for a week to ten days, I called back and was told that some emails had gotten screwed up and that they were waiting for a part but work would start soon. After another week or so I called back. I gave all my information and was told that the issue would be looked into and someone would get back to me. No one called back that day or the next. I called again, no less that 3 times and gave my information only to never be called back. To this date, no one has done any work or called me back to let me know what is going on. It has been over a month since my initial call to Mr Handyman. Needless to say, I am going to find someone else to do the work. As far as I know, no one has even gone out to the second property to look at the job. No one has ever called me back with a quote."
5,"DELIGHTED WITH QUALITY, SKILL, AND RESOURCEFULNESS, AND WILLINGNESS TO COLLABORATE WITH AN EDUCATED EYE TO COST EFFECTIVENESS."
5,"My dog ate through my door frame in a panic attack! Dan from Mr. Handyman came out and cut out the damage and replaced it, as good as new! Mr. Handyman was less than half the cost of other quotes, and the work was well done! Being a single girl, cost is definitely an important factor in my buying decision! Great response time, friendly tech...even showed up early! I will call them again in the future! Highly recommended! A+++"
5,"Excellent. Everything went smoothly and project was done professionally. I will be using Dan in the future for tiling (sidesplash) in the kitchen and to install a wood floor in the kitchen, dining room and living room."
5,"Day one, patch about 12 holes, fill in areas around breaker box and first coat of sheetrock. day two. second coat of sheetrock. day three final sand smooth areas (needed hardly any sanding) and texture ceiling patches. Overall the work was PERFECT. Super high quality work. The man who did the work came in, assessed the situation, and got right to work. I will admit it is not an easy task we gave him and thats why it cost so much. in the end they worked quickly and did excellent work which was important because we were trying to get our house ready to sell and didnt want holes everywhere in the basement as an unfinished project. I should have called them a year ago instead of thinking I could do it myself."
5,"We have contracted Deitmar's services several times for various odd jobs around our home. Most recently, he installed a ceiling fan and in-wall safe. He is always professional, cleans up any mess and punctual. We will continue to contact Deitmar whenever we have an odd job - would highly recommend."
1,They came out and basically wrote down everything that I needed to have done which I thought I could have just given them over the phone. The guy that came out said that could not give me an estimate but someone else would reach out within two days with the estimate. I waited over two weeks and have not heard back from them.
5,good job...on time and professional..and cleaned up the mess...
1,Mr. Handyman never showed up for his service appointment. Please do not schedule with them.
1,Called twice and left a message twice the week of 5/5/2014. Never got a return phone call.
5,"Misc services. Hanging curtain rods, pictures, shelves. Fix leaking shower."
4,Chose a different contractor based on expedited scheduling requirements.
1,unfortunately I was told he did not provide service on the NE side. Or should I say my home address. Athough the ad states East and West.
5,Very prompt and on time.? Always cleans up.? Does a great job with everything.
5,"It went fine. Handyman easily and quickly repaired the door and exposed brick outside. He also mounted a few photos. He was on time, professional and friendly."
1,"Charged me to come and fix the gutter guards that they have installed. Gutter guards have COMPLETELY fallen off. I have called there 5 times, and I get the same response that someone in the office will get back to me, however no one has bothered to call me. I have given them an ample opportunity to come out and fix this issue. All they have to do is call me one time and we can rectify this problem. I would tell them to not ignore your customers. Showed up at my house without contacting me, luckily I was able to come home to oversee the work. If they come out and fix this issue, all will be well."
5,"Worker arrived in timely fashion and finished what he could. He could not do the tuckpointing because it was raining, so he came back the next day and finished that part. This is the third time I've used this company and have yet to be disappointed!"
4,"It went well! Contractor was on time, courteous and offered a cost-effective solution to the repairs."
5,It went well. He was prompt. We told him what we needed done and he took care of it. It took him less than half a day.
5,"because we had already moved to N Carolina, Michael's team had additional hurdles to gain access for several visits our realtor said that they had done a great job, and we will use him again, if we need anything else done!"
5,fine. do not send this again as you have sent it multiple times and i have submitted this in the past. yr service is good but please do not send me anymore reviews to fill out for mr handyman avon ohio thanks
5,Michael was prompt each and every visit. This gave our tenants confidence that he'd be there when told at least 1 day in advance
1,"The handyman worked for a few hours on various projects for us, then proceeded to make a slew of ""freshman mistakes"" during the course of the day. He incorrectly hung up our towel rack (did not use a leveler so it was lopsided and did not ask me where we wanted it to be placed) then started to put together my baby's dresser. There was a damaged part of the dresser and he continued to put this together without asking me what the next steps were (e.g. continue to put it together or disassemble it since we needed to return it.) When I confronted the technician about this, he would NOT discount my rate. He left angry, left a semi-assembled dresser and would not take responsibility for his actions. Not only that, but he also had a laundry list of projects left for him that were unfinished. I contacted Michael Fay who only agreed to discount my rate and come out days later to both disassemble the damaged dresser and reassemble the new one as I had a limited amount of time to disassemble the dresser and return it to in order to get a new dresser. This never happened. He was only able to come out days later as they were ""busy"" and offered the same technician who did the work before (I did not want the original technician to come who did the shoddy work). He called a day before coming out and said that they would no longer be coming out and they would just not charge me. Days later I received a bill (with a discount) after he had previously told me that we would not be getting a bill. When I informed him that he originally said that I would not be charged, he sent a threatening email and said that he had ""changed his mind."" Not good business practices. I would NEVER work with Michael Fay or any of his technicians ever again. Here's why - if you have a client issue, you resolve it and fast. You never go back on your word if you saw its on us and then charge people. You don't leave a project unresolved. Lastly, you do not threaten your customers. I hope that this is a ""teachable moment"" for Michael about what ""not"" to do."
5,"The personnel did an excellent job. He did his job, and finished it at the time he allotted. He was a nice guy."
5,"Overall, the experience was very pleasant. Within a day after I contacted Mr. Handyman through e-mail, I received a phone call. He made arrangements at my convenience to come to the house and give us an estimate. ( very happy with the estimate ) . He informed us that he would watch the weather situation and as soon as it was warmer, he would set up the appointment to repair the frame. This was also at our convenience, as we informed him originally that this project was not urgent and we preferred it not be done until the weather would permit us to do the follow up painting that would be needed, after the project was completed. As soon as the weather permitted, he called us to set up a time to do the job. The handyman that came was very punctual and very friendly. He explained to me exactly how this happens ( the rotted wood ) and he described the material that he would be using to replace this section. This was a very tight fit and he displayed alot of patience with the continuous measuring and recutting of the material to make it a good fit . The final cost turned out to be even less than the estimate which was a pleasant surprise for us. I have other small projects and one by one will be calling Mr. Handyman in the future. While he was here, I had asked for advice on another issue I have, and he was very informative and explained several different options that could be used to do that repair. Not asking for any kind of an estimate at the time, but I was relieved to hear there were different options to resolve that problem also."
5,"Called for and received estimate. Work was scheduled to be performed at our convenience. Repairman was punctual, knowledgeable and friendly, Price was very fair and work is very good."
5,Overall it was a good experience. I gave a B for price only because i normally do my own work but couldn't reach the vents. I also gave a B for quality only because the individual who performed the work left some screws in the driveway where they were parked.
4,"The caprenter's name was Jim, very nice and knew just what to do. (I had a leaky porch roof and needed some stairs rebuilt) They make the steps at their plant and brought them to the house. All was done in the two days they said they would be."
5,"It went very well from the initial estimate to the finished work. The estimate was what I was expecting to pay, and the follow through and actual work was done professionally and promptly. I am very pleased."
5,"I have used them before. They knew my house and I knew them, which made it much easier. They were quite reasonable and worked quickly. They had all the equipment. They did a really good job and did what I wanted."
5,They were very nice and did a great job. They were professional and I was very pleased with the service.
5,It was excellent; they were friendly and did the job well.
5,"The owner came to my house the night before my schedule appointment to take a look at what needed to be done, exactly. When Bill (the handyman) showed up the next day he was fairly well prepared on what needed to be done. He cut out one plank (I was afraid more would need to be removed) about 16 inches long and popped in a new one. Bill was very nice and let me watch as he worked. All in all it took about an hour and it was all finished."
1,It didn't go at all.........we did not/will not hire him after poor responsiveness to request for an estimate.
5,"I called Mr. Handyman and requested an estimate for the repairs to my porch. Mike was that person who came out within that week and gave me a prompt estimate over the phone the same day. I was still looking for other estimates ( which I had to wait 3 weeks for). I found that the price was much lower that the others. When we scheduled the work, they were out within 1 week. The work was done within one day. I thought one board on the porch looked ""funny"" and he come out right away and replaced it. No muss, no fuss. He will be handling all of my repairs in the future. Way to go Mike!!!"
1,There were two stages to the job. Removed the roof and the supports of columns. He did not replaced them and replaced it with a thinner grade for the roof. After he took $45.00 for the discounts he did not take that off. The total came out to $2980.00. I realized that the job did not look supportive and the chair were puncturing the roof. He offered a full deck roofing to be put down. I could not do it because I was leaving. He said he would womanized replacement on the roof. He punctured the roofing materials and it was no longer good. By that time I was gone. I asked my brother to go and take a look at it. My son who is a roof carpenter was so upset for the work. I'm back now and I need to get the work done now.
5,They did a nice job. The young guy showed right up and looked over things and told me how much it would be. Then within a few days a gentlemen showed up and did the painting and everything was good. They were prompt and nice. They got everything finished in one day and didn't mess around. I would definitely call them again for work around the house.
5,Very efficient with call back to review work to be done and provide estimate. Quick scheduling of work and gentleman that performed the work was very friendly and professional and did a great job. Trim looks great.
1,"Came out and looked at our utility room and our small bathroom. We didn’t hear from him for two weeks. Finally, I called for the proposal. I feel he should have called us sooner, also he wanted to charge us $2,000.00 for the work. Which i feel was way over priced for the work."
2,"I had some issues with the work that they did but it got resolved. They completed 90% of how the work should have been completed. I spent a few bucks on them to complete it. It is complete now but there were some hazels with the guy who was running it. Now, everything is complete. They customized some stuff in the kitchen for me but I have an issue with the final work that they did. I spent a week and a half with them. I gave them a shot because their overall pricing was good. I needed them to fix something that they had to put together but I ended up having to make them do some work after I paid them. Now, they have got the money so I am probably not going to use them again."
5,I have been using this company 7 years. They are excellent and always finish the job. They are reasonably price and are punctual.
4,"I have a strong recollection not of what he looked like, but of what he worked like. I would not call him again. I had him install a wall shelf--which I asked him to attach to the wall. He had to do it twice because the first time it was not level . He had a helper with him who did nothing but hand him tools. He charged, what I would say was a considerable amount. Other than charging too much, he was fine."
4,He was good. The door went and it works. They are right on time and cleaned up after themselves.
5,I had a pull chain previously. They came in and put a new light switch. They were not very expensive and the quality of work was good. I was satisfied with their service.
5,They explained everything to me and the job went very well. I like that I can call them up and they will come out usually within the week. They will accommodate my schedule and have even come on a weekend. I will use them again.
4,"The appointment manager returned my call promptly, unlike other electircians that I had called. He asked that I send him a picture of the fixture and sent someone out. The actual serviceman found that he needed to go buy a new fixture, but he did so and replaced it. He was professional and courteous. Unfortunately, due to the unplanned shopping trip, he asked that we reschedule having the garage grounded, which had originally ben included in our request. Otherwise we were quite pleased and would use this service again."
4,"He sent a technician out and he did fine. I tried to call the owner to negotiate the estimate, but he refused to return my calls. He tried to bill me $830 for 3 1/2 hours of work in total."
4,"It went very well after Jim G came, but he was not the person who came and gave me the estimate. Apparently Mr. Fri wanted off today. I was happy that Jim G got all the work done."
5,I recommended him and he did a considerable amount of work for me. There was a leak and he did some tile work and repaired the ceiling. The leak alternatively was supposed to be fixed by the plumber but which wouldn’t. He was pretty damn good. He came and adjusted our schedule. The man he sent was very nice. They did the work and the work is nice. I thought that the guys who came were a bit slow as they were paid on hourly basis and I thought that they could have done faster. They were pleasant and did the work. I thought that they took more time but it was okay. Basically they were good. They did the job and got it done. It took two times to diagnose the leak eventually.
5,"It is not easy to get a provider to do a relatively small job this time of year, with constant rain periods requiring schedule adjustment. Previous experience with another firm was a total waste of time, as they just didn't show up. Michael responded with in a few days and had someone up on the roof for a quote quickly. Missed one appointment, due to rain, but came two days later.A huge problem off my plate as I just had surgery."
5,"I called on Oct. 7th and Mr. Fay sent someone out the same day to check things out. He called back later in the day to say that someone would be out to the house on Monday morning. The repairman was very personable, concerned and thorough. I would absolutely use this company again. I do not think that the price is out of line, and it is worth it to me to get these nagging little things done. In fact, the railing on my stairway just broke and Ill probably be calling them again to replace it, if they can!"
5,The work was performed in not the best of conditions. The laundry area was crowded and not a lot of room to work. The exhaust vent went into the attic and not easily accessible. Both problems were solved to my satisfaction.
1,never showed for his appointment with us. Never called us.
1,Did not come to my home to give an estimate or call me back after more than two weeks.
5,"it went very well , Jim arrived on time and everything was done quickly and neatly"
3,"I also bought a double lock set so he could replace the locks on the front and back doors. He replaced the back door lock but did not touch the front door lock. When I tried to use the new key on the front door, I had to replace the front door lock myself."
5,This is a step by step procedure with time needed in between for drying of materials used in the various phases. This my main bathroom & they were prompt in arriving in a timely manner as the were able to continue with the next step. I have used them before and will use them again
5,"I had water in my basement and was not sure why. I called and they came out immediately (within an hour) and determined that my sump pump had stopped working. This was a Thursday. They helped me clean up the water and arranged to provide me with a quote for the pump. The next day there was more water so I called them again and they were right back. One of the gentlemen even offerred to bring me his personal dehumidifier to help dry the space. Over the weekend they called to make sure I was not having any more problems. On Monday they replaced the sump pump nd the back-up pump. While they were there, they also replaced my doorbell and a couple of very high light bulbs. The best part of the service was that it was clear they cared about the service they provided. I was not just another customer on the list - they went out of their way to make sure I was satisfied. This was not the first time I have used this company and I would do so again without hesitation."
1,I sent email and left phone messages and was never contacted...finally just decided to go with someone else.
5,"They did a wonderful job, and I would not hesitate to use them again. I would highly recommend them to others. They were professional, on time, and neat."
5,"It went very well. This is the third time that I have had work done by Mr. Handyman, and I am always pleased with their work."
5,"EXCELLENT service. Complete professionalism, expert quality workmanship. The gentleman came exactly on time, worked incredibly quickly and treated my home with care and respect. They will be my go to guys for handy work in the future!"
5,"Everything went very well! They are very prompt, professional, and get everything done right."
5,"I had pigeons on my bedroom awning, so they installed the spikes to take care of the issue. Everything was super!"
2,"Michael had come out and gave us an estimate. We already had the wood from floors we had done earlier. When Michael looked at the project, he stated the left over wood would be enough to complete the job. He quoted us $1200 for the project and we offered to pay cash for a $100 discount. His carpeter, Jim, showed up two hours late the day of the job. As far as the quality of the work, it was satisfactory. When Jim got to the second landing, the last part of the project, he stated there was not enough wood to complete. He claimed he could use his wood and try to use carpeting as well. He did not finish that day and would come back on Tuesday 6/1/10. He completed the everything but the second landing on Tuesday. We feel we should receive some money back since they did not complete the full project we hired them to do. I asked them if it was fair to pay a lower price since they did not complete the contract. He was not willing to lower the price to $1000, or $100 off for the incomplete work. He became very upset and would only lower the price to $1040. After speaking with Jim, Michael hung up the phone before explaining the same price to me. I waited on the phone for him to talk to me about it after speaking with Jim, but he did not. I was very upset by this lack of courtesy. I also wanted to use the coupon through Angie's List ($25 off) and they made this seem like a large issue as well. I decided not to push the issue since they were unwilling to work with us on the incomplete job. If he was willing to charge $1000 for the work, I would have been satisfied."
5,"He repaired the door problem and installed the closer in a short time. I had to pay a one hour minimum, so I had him move a nightstand and my bed to make wheelchair access easier."
5,"Everything turned out well. The water damage on the ceiling looked great when they were done, and it blended in perfectly. The price is very good, and they are courteous and prompt. Having the debris removed took a little longer than I would have liked, but they were neat otherwise. I was happy with their work and would use them again."
5,"They are fantastic. When I called the company, they said they could do it the next morning because I had to work around a doctor appointment, which was no problem. They were here promptly and were very courteous and friendly. They just took control of everything and got the job done. I loved them, and it looks beautiful."
5,He fixed that and also he did a few other things to finish the hour he was charging us for. He was super and I would recommend him to others.
5,Good job. No supervision needed. Only they wanted a credit card hold -- probably because I was a first time customer.
4,I was told that the job was relatively small and would probably only take an hour. They could be out the following afternoon. I had to provide the make and color of our vinyl siding. When I got home the following afternoon nothing was done. I waited until Thursday morning and called to see what happened. When the worker picked up the piece of siding he didn't know until he reached the house that the store gave him the wrong color. He had to go back and get the right color. The office person was very apologetic that no one called to let me know. They came that afternoon and fixed the corner. It looks great.
5,I was very pleased with their work. They were very professional. They were on time and cleaned up after themselves. i would definitely refer them to other people.
5,"We have had no problems at all, and the project turned out well."
5,"Good experience. I'm an out-of-state landlord, so my tenant called Mr. Handyman based on word of mouth. The person who took the call recommended that we obtain a new disposer rather than buy through them, in order to save some money. That worked out well, and the repair work was painless for my tenant."
5,He did a good job on each and I am thinking of hiring him again.
4,"The owner was fine. The man who came to fix our siding tried to charge us over $200 more than the original quote. I had to tell him what the original quote was and so he called the employee to check if that was correct. It made for an awkward situation. I did pay them a little extra for working hard, but I was still thrown for a loop. Overall, I was pleased with the quality of the work."
5,Jim was great. He works very hard and the quality was excellent.
5,"I spoke to Kathy and she was very good and professional over the phone. They are acceptable and I was very happy to talk to a live person instead of a voice mail. They are there everyday apparently from 9 to 5, and I really like that. I would most definitely call them again if need be."
5,They are very nice and competent. They corrected everything. They have done very neat work. I am very pleased.
4,"It did not take very long to get the wallpaper off. The employee patched the drywall and let this work day overnight. He returned the next day to prime the surface and paint it. Since he painted the surface shortly after priming it, there was a tendency for the primer and paint to mix and/or for the paint to mix with caulk that he applied between the shower/bath fixture and wall to prevent future moisture penetration. A few weeks later I put an layer of paint on most of all of the surface above the bath/shower."
5,He did good work and at a fair price.
1,"IN MY ESTIMATION, MR. HANDYMAN SHOULD NOT HAVE EVEN CONSIDERED CHARGING MORE THAN $40-50, WHEN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WAS ACCOMPLISHED. THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS A REAL SHOCK TO ME SINCE MY EXPERIENCE WITH CONTRACTORS RATED A ON ANGIES LIST HAVE, UP UNTIL TODAY, BEEN EXTREMELY PROFICIENT AND WORTHY OF THEIR EXCELLENT ""A"" RATING. MR. HANDYMAN GETS AN ""F""!"
5,"They were very good & were very prompt with returning phone calls, very professional & did an excellent job of diagnosing the problem & correcting it. I would hire them again in the future."
5,"They were trustworthy, nice, pleasant, professional and did a very good job."
5,It was very good. He just seemed to be very knowledgeable about being a handyman. He gives out a very confident air about him. He was very respectful and polite.
5,"This company was great and I will use them again. They came out in the exact time frame I needed. The worker was very professional, and when I called they gave me some suggestions to help me save money. The final service ended up being less expensive than the quoted price on the phone. Overall this company is very efficient and I would recommend them and use them anytime in the future."
5,"On time, very polite, good job & reasonably priced."
5,"Jim worked hard and professionally the whole time he was here. He had the right tools for the jobs, except on one occasion. I was very pleased with his work. When he was done I finished by painting the posts and caps and they look good."
5,"I hired the Mr. Handymen crew 2 - 3 times while preparing to put our house on the market. They were very responsive, willing to do a variety of jobs, even adding some newly discovered jobs onto their list after they had come to the house. If they didn't have the tools they needed, they ran out to get it. Very easy to work with, fast, and efficient."
5,"Mr. Handyman gives you the option to purchase your own goods. I chose them to purchase and do the work. They charge $130 an hour. It seemed high to me, but since I cannot do the work I was satisfied that it was done in a timely manner."
5,"The technicians were very helpful, courteous and personable. I have used them for larger jobs in the past and would definitely use them again."
3,"I wouldn't hire him for doing my lights again. I just thought that he was too expensive for putting up just Christmas lights. The work was adequate, though."
5,"They were fine! They were able to do the work just fine, and they were very easy to work with. The task was completed before the end of the pre-paid time period."
4,"He charged for one hour, regardless of how long the job took."
5,"They did a great job. Professional, work man like staff. Good office and scheduling support and attention to detail. Flexible to small changes. Any issues that a rose were handled expertly. We are having them quote our kitchen remodel now."
1,"STOP! Beware! Don t let their ad confuse you! Mr. Handyman was hired to install a shower door in a brand new bathroom. While they were on the job we added the tissue holder and towel bar. We contacted Mr. Handyman because the door was leaking. They sent out a tech to assess the problem & sealed where the thought the leak was. Needless to say it was still leaking after use of the shower. This went on for many days and many visits for Mr. Handyman to attempt to correct this problem. Michael Fay (owner) had us convinced we purchased a defective door. We went to a supply store and found Mr. Handyman installed the door incorrectly. The technician did not use all the hardware and cut the bottom track too short (see picture). After 30 days of not getting positive results working with Mr. Handyman, door still leaking, hardware still missing, mess every time they are back to assess the problem using my tools, I requested a full refund. Another 30 days pass with numerous request for a refund, Michael refuses the refund and wants to continue to come back to stop the leak. I felt after 60 days of no results a refund was not asking too much. Michael hired an attorney and sent a settlement agreement and release in the amount of $180. We accepted just so we could put an end to this nonsense. Mr. Handyman is not capable of installing a shower door. Mr. Handyman charged us $125 to install a tissue holder and towel bar. For all the inconvenience, damage to the walls, adjusting working schedules if any charge at all due should have been the $78 for the first hour per his business description. Perhaps Michael is saying it took Mr. Handyman over an hour to install a tissue holder and towel bar."
5,"It went excellent. All the phone calls, setting up, making a list of estimates for me all went great. I could decide which ones I wanted to pick from. I chose them all. His name is Bill Arison."
5,Thankful for their willingness to provide immediate service in an emergency.
5,He does an excellent job. It's $78 for the first hour and $39 for each additional half hour. I will continue to use his services.
5,"The company sent a professional employee to help with some home repairs. The work was done expertly and in a timely fashion. The fellow who did the work was conscientious, he cleaned up after himself and I was comfortable having him in my home. I HIGHLY recommend Mr. Handyman for help with home repairs. I can not say enough good about them!"
5,"All work perfectly, and he never 'cut corners', even after I told him that would be acceptable."
1,"The job was well performed but they charged $80.00/hour which is pretty steep. But to add insult to injury, they charge a $40.00 appointment fee (?). I do not pay such a fee when I schedule a doctor's appointment or make an appointment for car repair. This $40.00 is just plain greed. Angie's List should not honor such businesses that clearly ""rip off"" the customer."
5,They made an appointment to do the work.
4,I didn't the quality of their work. They charge by the hour and the job took longer than it should have. If I would have know they charged by the hour I wouldn't have hired them.
1,Bill came to my house on 9/21 in order to give me an estimate on replacing my fence. As of 10/18 he has not contacted me with the estimate.
4,"I realized the toilet seal was leaking and running down the wall in the garage. I knew Mr. Handyman was expensive, but they were the only ones who could come out within a week. I thought I'd have to have the flooring repaired but was told it wasn't necessary. A few weeks later I noticed a rocking when sitting on the toilet. hey came back out and screwed down both bolts on each side of the toilet."
5,"Brent found that previous owner had added under sink instant hot water heater, using outlet previously occupied by dishwasher. Dishwasher was now hardwired to 'lighting' breaker. Brent came the same day that I called."
5,Jim was here at 9 o'clock on Monday morning when arrived he said that the cost would be around $139.00. Jim repaired the handle on the stove. Jim was very fast and also saved me a lot of money because the final cost was $39.00.
5,"Michael was prompt and helpful, making suggestions that only a real pro would have known. The seller contacted the builder Ryan Homes, who sent a crew to make those repairs, even though the home itself was past the warranted period. I paid Michael for the beautiful writeup of his estimate, great guy to work with! Thanks, Michael!"
5,"I especially liked the technician that came out, he was very professional and knowledgeable. They were very responsive and I got prompt service."
4,"Company was fine. They didn't show up when they were supposed to but, they did come out the second time I called."
3,"They were most responsive. I live out of town, and they would say they did the work, and someone would go look for me and the work wasn't completed."
3,"Most of the work the carpenter did was excellent. There seemed to be some sort of communication error between the owner and the carpenter. The entire job was expected to take 1.5 days. It took 2.5. The owner quoted me 1535 for the work. I left a detailed list of what I believed to be part of the quote with a request that someone call me if it deviated from the quote. The carpenter built a detailed rail system that was both not asked for and not quoted. The owner later tried to charge me for it, claiming the facia board - which he apparently didn't quote - took too long. I refused and canceled the remaining work. He called 2 days later and explained that most of the over run was caused by the rail system. He offered to finish the work for the quoted price, I agreed to pay a bit more because I like the railing. After the dispute, I thought the remaining work was slightly sub standard indicating a desire to cut the companies losses. Painting was especially bad."
5,"We were very happy with everything, starting with the phone conversation with the person who makes the appointments. She explained everything in detail. The work was done to our satisfaction and the technician was very professional. We would definitely call Mr. Handyman for future work."
4,They're very friendly and efficient.
5,Everytime he was on time and did a great job! It is nice to have everything in the house working right! I would call again!
5,"Bill was very functional! He was neat, clean, pleasant. He came in a head of time, finished before the estimated time! There were a couple jobs that he said he didn't feel comfortable doing, so they'll be back in a couple days with some one else that can price the jobs. They originally wouldn?t honor the Angie?s List, and I was told by Mr. Fay that they put both coupons on this next bill. I was told that because this work was a continuation of previous work they would waive the $39 fee. They didn?t take care of the bill while they were at the house and I had to sign a paper saying that they would take care of it at the office. I want $89 refund to honor the 2 coupons and the $39 fee."
5,The electrician showed up and installed both lights. No problems.
5,"They were extremely pleasant, real flexible. My neighbor came over and they took two antennas off his roof. They're just really nice people to be around."
5,"He got everything taken care of for me. He did a very good job, and even though they were different job, he knew how to take care of everything."
5,"Service tech Bill Gantz was punctual, well informed, pleasant and definitely qualified for my requirements."
4,"I called them and they were willing to come out the same day to do the work, but I was not ready. They were at the house the next day and completed the job quickly, efficiently, and courteously. I would definitely call them again!"
5,The things repaired were things that needed doing since we first moved in. They were done well and with a minimum of fuss.
5,"Overall experience excellent. Will definitely use service again. Great service for small jobs. Very punctual. Jim, the technician, very nice. Answered all questions, quality of work was great."
5,"They called to set an appointment for an estimate. They arrived on time and spent time evaluating job and talking with us. We were given a written estimate and told we'd get a call the next day to set time for workman to arrive. The time was set, the workman arrived punctually, and the work was done professionally and to our complete satisfaction. We'd call them again without hesitation."
5,He fixed the problem and did a good job. He was friendly and an overall nice guy.
1,"When I called I got a sales pitch. I let them know what I wanted. They said they do not give estimates, they only come out and do the job. She put me on hold and then said someone would come out the same day to take a look. I waited and waited when finally about 4:30 I received a voiemail saying he wasn't in the area and they would get back to me by the end of the week. I never heard from them."
5,"After trying for weeks to have another handyman come over but never returned calls, I called Mr. Handyman. They were very detailed, gave me all the information up front on pricing and how the appointment would be handled. They even called the day before to confirm the appointment. They were on time, very efficient and only charged for the time they were there. I will definitely call them again for little things around the house because they were so professional, reliable, and did a great job."
5,Have asked for several estimates. They always get back to you with an answer within a week; the office girl is very good.
5,"Dan the service technician for Mr Handyman arrived on right date/time and offered a cordial greeting. Kathy, Office Admin. had left me a confirm/reminder message on previous business day which is always nice to get. Dan looked over job first, set up his sawhorse and tools and got right to work. I have used the services of Mr. Handyman before and do have confidence in their skills and ability to do the job correctly. Mr Handyman does not give estimates, paid or not. They don't tell you either what job materials to get. There is currently a two hour minimum fee so you really have to know what you need to be done and the correct materials on hand to do the job. My understanding is they will go and buy the materials for you but that costs extra. It forces the customer to research the project in order to buy right supplies before hand. That is the part that stresses me the most. Live and learn, I guess. You do get what you pay for, your projects promptly and professionally completed."
1,I left a message and they have not returned my call.
2,"He charges $195 for the first hour, including just to come out and take a look. Following that he charges $19.95 per quarter hour. I didn't even have him come out because of his price."
5,"When I called, the service asked all the right questions and took great notes. When Jim arrived he had a print out of virtually everything I had said, so he was very prepared. Jim was on time (actually 10 minutes early), laid down drop cloths, and did some of the more grimy work outside to limit the dirt in my house. Jim also spent the time to really diagnose my problems rather than jumping to the conclusion that I needed new equipment. His diligence and innovative solutions kept me from buying new parts of about $200."
5,"Very positive. The handyman came the same day I called. Very pleasant, professional and knowledgeable man!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
1,They never called. I am disappointed that they never called back to give me an estimate. I did think that was unprofessional.
5,I'VE SAID IT ALL. THEY DO WHAT WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO.
2,I feel that they were unprofessional by not getting back to me with an estimate. I would not contact them again.
5,"Fast, efficient, hard working, and thorough worker. Brought concrete and 4x4. I had the mailbox. I got a free fire extinguisher."
5,The Handyman Company is a company that is extremely professional. They treat customers with respect and really care about satisfying their customers!! They were great communicators. They were proud of their work.
5,Excellent! Prompt service and extremely nice service tech!
5,"BILL WAS ON TIME. HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO, HAD THE TOOLS NEEDED AND LASTED NO TIME IN ACCOMPLISHING THE TASK. WE WERE VERY IMPRESSED AND GRATEFUL TO GET THE WORK DONE IN SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME."
5,They were very professional. They were on time and courteous.
5,Service was prompt and efficient. Service tech was very courteous and professional. Price was reasonable & fair.
5,"I am happy as he was on time and done quick. He arrived before the scheduled time. Labor charge is $78 per hour. I thought it was interesting that as soon as he entered the house, he put plastic covers over his shoes. He was very clean and didn't leave a mess when finished."
5,"WE HAD 4 TOTALLY DIFFERENT JOBS ALL SIMPLE, BUT NOT WORTH CALLING AN ELECTRICIAN, PLUMBER OR CARPENTER. MR. HANDYMAN IS A GREAT RESOURCE, WHEN MANY SMALL JOBS ARE NEEDED AND ALL THE WORK WAS DONE IN 2 HOURS."
5,HE WAS ON TIME & DID THE WORK COMPLETELY.
5,"TOM WAS EARLY, VERY POLITE AND HELPFUL. I WILL DEFINITELY USE MR. HANDYMAN AGAIN."
5,JOB WAS COMPLETED PROFESSIONALLY & ON TIME. COMMUNICATION TO ME WAS PROMPT & ACCURATE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM FOR GENERAL HOUSE REPAIRS.
5,THEY DID A GOOD JOB BUT A LITTLE PRICEY.
2,"DID NOT POWERWASH DOOR FRAMES, WINDOW FRAMES, GARAGE DOOR, FRONT OF HOME (BRICK). CAME BACK THREE TIMES TO MAKE RIGHT. STILL HAVE NOT POWERWASHED GARAGE DOOR OR BRICK FRONT. APPARENTLY POWERWASHING DOES NOT INCLUDE ENTIRE HOME."
5,"VERY PROFESSIONAL, SHOWED UP ON TIME FOR ESTIMATING AND TO COMPLETE JOB. QUALITY OF WORK WAS VERY GOOD."
5,"USED ANGIE'S COUPON FOR $25 OFF. VERY QUICK AND OFFERED SUGGESTIONS, VERY NEAT AND PERSONABLE."
5,"I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH ALL THEIR WORK. THERE WAS ONE INDIVIDUAL THAT PERFORMED ALL THESE VARIOUS JOBS & DID EACH PROFESSIONALLY. HE WAS EFFICIENT, COURTEOUS, & PLEASANT TO HAVE AROUND THE HOUSE (HE EVEN HELPED A NEIGHBOR WHO ASKED TO MOVE SOME LARGE STONES WHILE HE WAS WAITING FOR SOME PAINT TO DRY). HE ALSO WAS HELPFUL TO ME WITH ADVICE ON HOW TO APPROACH SEVERAL MINOR REPAIRS JOBS THAT I WAS DOING MYSELF. THEY DISCLOSE THAT THEY HAVE AN ""ADD-ON"" CHARGE TO ANY MATERIALS THEY PURCHASE FOR THE WORK. I PURCHASED MOST OF MY OWN MATERIAL TO LIMIT THIS COST (THE EXCEPTION WAS THE PAINT FOR THE BASEMENT FLOOR). I CALLED THEM AFTER THE INITIAL WORK TO HAVE THEM PAINT THE BASEMENT FLOOR, SO IT MAY HAVE BEEN CHEAPER IF I HAD INCLUDED THE BASEMENT FLOOR IN THE INITIAL CONTRACT OF WORK. ONLY MINOR COMPLAINT IS THAT FOLLOW-UP PHONE CALLS ARE SOMETIMES SLOW. THIS IS A MINOR ISSUE FROM MY STANDPOINT &, I SUSPECT, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE BUSY."
5,"TOM CAME OUT TO THE HOUSE TO DO THE WORK. HE WAS VERY PERSONABLE AND PROFESSIONAL. ONE OF THE MIRRORS WAS INSTALLED USING WIRE, WHICH BY NO FAULT OF HIS, BROKE IN HALF. HE REPAIRED AND COMPLETELY PAINTED THE WALL AND REHUNG THE MIRROR. HE WENT OVER AND ABOVE HIS JOB TO MAKE US HAPPY. I WOULD LOVE TO USE TOM AGAIN, AND PROBABLY WILL. WHAT I DO NOT LIKE IS THE SERVICE CHARGE OF $35 TACKED ON TO THE $70 PER HOUR FEE, WHICH I CONSIDER STEEP. MAYBE THEY SHOULD CONSIDER A YEARLY ''MEMBERSHIP'' FEE INSTEAD OF $35-40 SERVICE CHARGE PER VISIT."
5,"TOM - THEIR REPRESENTATIVE CAME OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS NEEDED FIRST, TOLD ME WHAT PARTS TO GET, CALLED TO VERIFY WHEN HE WAS COMING, CAME ON TIME, DID A QUICK EFFICIENT JOB, AND EXPLAINED WHAT HE WAS DOING."
5,I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIS WORK AND WOULD CERTAINLY CALL HIM AGAIN. HE ARRIVED RIGHT ON TIME AND DID HIS WORK PROMPTLY.
5,"VERY PROFESSIONAL, EASY TO GET APPOINTMENT, DID A GREAT JOB."
5,"MICHAEL THE OWNER WAS FRIENDLY AND COURTEOUS. TOM THE HANDYMAN WAS NOT JUST ON TIME, BUT EARLY. HE WAS POLITE, FRIENDLY, EFFICIENT, WILLING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS DURING THE JOB, DIDN'T SMOKE OR LISTEN TO LOUD MUSIC AND WAS EVEN CREATIVE WHEN ASKED TO MOVE LARGE TREE TRUNK PIECES TO ANOTHER SPOT IN THE BACK YARD. THE PIECES WERE PLACED ARTFULLY. I WAS ABSOLUTELY OVERALL PLEASED WITH THE WORK WHICH TOOK A TOTAL OF 3 1/2 DAYS. TOM DID A WONDERFUL CLEANUP JOB. THE ONLY THING I HAD TO DO WAS VACUUM THE SAWDUST FROM THE PORCH AFTER TOM HAD FIT A LOT OF TASKS INTO THE 2ND DAY, FINISHING UP IN THE FINAL HOUR. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF HE HAD VACUUMED, BUT THAT'S THE LEAST I'VE EVER HAD TO DO AS FAR AS CLEANUP AFTER SOMEONE HAS WORKED ON THE PROPERTY, SO I'D SAY THAT'S PRETTY GOOD! THE HOURLY RATE IS $70.00. A BIT MORE THAN OTHER ESTIMATES, BUT WELL WORTH IT."
4,"CLEAN, EXPLAINED WHAT HE WOULD DO AND IN WHAT TIME FRAME."
5,"EXTREMELY PLEASED. QUICK RESPONSE AND EXCELLENT WORK. THE JOB WENT OVER TWO DAYS AND COULDN'T BE HAPPIER WITH THE WORK. WE'RE NOW TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE OTHER SMALL JOBS WE'VE BEEN PUTTING OFF. THE PRICE AND QUALITY ARE IN SYNCH. AND BILL, WHO DID THE JOB, WAS GREAT."
5,"TOM WAS ON TIME, POLITE, PROFESSIONAL AND NEAT. NO MESS AT ALL. VERY NICE JOB. I WOULD USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN."
5,"VERY HELPFUL, OFFERED HONEST ADVICE. PLEASED WITH RESULTS. WOULD CALL THEM AGAIN."
1,"A TIME WAS SET FOR 3 TO 3:30 ON A FRIDAY. I RETURNED HOME TO WAIT FOR THE REPAIR PERSON, BUT HE (OR SHE) NEVER SHOWED OR CALLED. ONE WEEK LATER I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL WANTING TO KNOW IF I STILL NEEDED THE WORK DONE. I TOLD THEM THAT I DID, BUT THAT I WOULD FIND SOMEONE ELSE. HE APOLOGIZED ABOUT MISSING THE APPOINTMENT AND NOT CALLING, BUT I FELT THIS WAS TOO LATE AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I WILL NOT USE THIS SERVICE AGAIN, EVEN THOUGH I DID ANOTHER TIME AND WAS HAPPY WITH THE COMPANY."
4,"SERVICE PERSON WAS PROFESSIONAL, POLITE, COURTEOUS, SEEMS TO BE GOOD WORK. PRICE WAS SURPRISING, BUT EVERYTHING ELSE, INCLUDING THE FACT HE USED BOOTIES TO PROTECT OUR FLOOR, WENT WELL."
4,"good, cleaned up, helpful"
5,Very good job i love it
1,H never showed
1,"I HAVE TRIED TO GET THIS COMPANY TO MY HOME TO GIVE ME AN ESTIMATE, BUT NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING, I DEALT WITH ABOUT 4 DIFFERENT PEOPLE."
5,PRICE WAS REASONABLE I WOULD HIRE AGAIN FOR A FUTURE REPAIR.
5,EXCELLENT SERVICE; WILL USE THEM AGAIN. VERY PROFESSIONAL AND INTERESTED IN DOING A HIGH-QUALITY JOB.
5,HE WAS VERY GOOD AND VERY DEDICATED TO RETURNING PHONE CALLS. HE WOULD GET BACK TO ME TO LET ME KNOW IF HE WAS TIED UP AND HE GOT BACK TO ME ON A SUNDAY. HE IS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND COURTEOUS.
5,WORKED VERY QUICKLY AND DID AN EXCELLENT JOB.
5,HE WAS A VERY NICE GENTLEMAN AND WAS EFFICIENT.
5,THE PRICE NEGOTIATION WENT FROM $540 TO $510 QUICKLY. SERVICE WAS PROMPT AND SCHEDULED EARLY. THE WORKER WAS FRIENDLY AND WORKED EFFICIENTLY.
1,"ALTHOUGH HE WAS VERY NICE, HE SIDE STEPPED MY REQUEST FOR AN ESTIMATE. HE HAS VERY HIGH PRICES. I TAKE THE BLAME FOR NOT PINNING HIM DOWN. HE CHARGED ME $64 FOR THE FIRST HALF HOUR! HE IS NOT AN UP FRONT PERSON. I FEEL HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME. JUST THINK HOW HE MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ELDERLY."
5,"BILL, THE HANDYMAN, WAS VERY POLITE AND ON TIME. DID SPECIFIED WORK IN A VERY TIMELY MANNER. I'VE USED THIS SERVICE TWICE BEFORE THIS AND WAS VERY PLEASED THEN ALSO. I SAVED $25, TOO!"
4,"HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME INVESTIGATING AND PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO IT. HE DISCOVERED IT WAS A VERY MINOR LEAK, BUT THE CONFIGURATION OF THE PLUMBING MADE TOO DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO REPAIR. HE RECOMMENDED A PLUMBER AND DID NOT CHARGE ANYTHING FOR HIS VISIT. I WOULD CONSIDER USING HIM IN THE FUTURE."
5,"HE KINDA DID SOME EXTRA WHEN HE REPAIRED THE WINDOW - HE NOTICED THAT THE TRACK WAS DIRTY, SO HE WENT TO HIS TRUCK AND GOT HIS CLEANER AND CLEANED IT FOR ME - NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE."
5,"THEY REALLY CLEANED UP WELL. THEY WERE PROMPT, PROFESSIONAL, AND FINISHED IN A TIMELY MANNER. I HAD SPECIFIC REQUESTS ABOUT THE TYPE OF MATERIAL TO BE USED, AND THEY MET MY EXPECTATIONS PRECISELY."
5,"ALL WORKED TURNED OUT FINE, VERY GOOD."
4,THEY HAD TO COME BACK TO RE-DO THE BOARDS AND THE GATE.
3,"THE DOOR LOCK WORKS BUT IT DOESN'T TURN VERY WELL, HE WAS NEAT, CLEAN, FRIENDLY, I FELT VERY COMFORTABLE FOR A FUTURE JOB."
5,"POLITE, PROMPT, EASY TO WORK WITH. EXPERIENCED WITH OLDER HOMES. VERY PLEASED."
5,IT WAS A LITTLE BIT PRICEY BUT I AM HAPPY WITH THE WORK. HE NEVER STOPPED OR TOOK A BREAK. HE WAS HARD WORKER. THE CHARGE WAS $60 AND HOUR PER MAN.
5,"RECOMMENDED WE PUT GUTTER COVERS ON OUR GUTTERS , DUE TO THE BERRY TREES WE HAVE IN OUR YARD. HE FOUND SOME COVERS AND BROUGHT THEM BACK TO SHOWED US WHAT TYPE TO USE(WHICH ARE GREAT SO THE BIRDS CAN'T GET IN THE GUTTERS). PROMPT PROFESSIONAL , FRIENDLY. HE GAVE ME A LIST OF ALL THE ITEMS HE DOES THAT INCLUDED 3 COLUMNS OF ITEMS. PURCHASED PAINT HIMSELF FOR THE CLOSET. I WILL USE HIM FOR ALL MY NEEDS. I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER FOR A LONG TIME AND HAVE USED OTHER HANDYMEN FROM THE LIST AND THIS GUY IS SO KNOWLEDGEABLE. JACK OF ALL TRADES, GREAT WORK."
3,I PROBABLY COULD HAVE DONE AS GOOD A JOB MYSELF. UNEVEN TILES AND DIDN'T LEAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR MY FIXTURES.
5,I WOULD RECOMMEND MR HANDYMAN WITHOUT A DOUBT
5,EXTREMELY RELIABLE. GOES OUT OF WAY FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.
5,EXTREMELY PLEASED. I AM VERY PICKY!

5,A little expensive but well done
5,"Excellent, would hire again"
4,It turned out okay.
3,He was over an hour late
5,I think they do a great job.
5,Consultation only
4,Very well. I am using them again.
5,No other bids were solicited.
5,It went well.
5,The grades speak for themselves.
5,I would recommend them to others.
5,Helpful advice freely given.
5,It was very good.
1,They never returned my calls.
5,EXCELLENT!
5,IT WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE.
5,Kjell responded immediately & with experience to an emergency request to replace a leaking Kitchen Faucet. Much appreciated.
5,Job went very well. Kjell and his crew were very professional and neat. Showed up on time. Good communication and easy to work with. Worked steady and completed the job in a timely manner. Would definitely hire them again.
5,"Excellent. Kjell resurfaced and refinished most parts of three bathrooms. The project took time, but went well and I'm very pleased with the result."
5,Great job! Would definitely hire again. Professional nd couteous.
1,"After a brief description of what I needed, the response was ""I don't mean to be rude, but do you want me to take on an 'afro-american project'?"" When I asked him to explain what he meant, he said ""do you want me to do a fix with like rubber-bands and bubble gum"". Enough said. Seems guys like this are less afraid of the light and are crawling out of the woodwork. Must be the Trump effect."
5,He's very honest and I would trust him with anything. I'll put it this way: I'd let him be in my house even if I wasn't here.
5,"Kjell was very busy with other projects but was able to fit us into his schedule. Communication was good, we kept in touch up until the day before he was supposed to come over to do the installation. Day of, he showed up early and got to work right away. The closet kit he installed looks great and was installed faster than I thought! Prices were reasonable, I will be calling him again for future needs."
5,He is wonderful. In fact he is coming today to do some work and I have a list for him. He has email and I email him my wish list and he told me when is available and it is going to be an ongoing working relationship. He really is very honest and goes by the clock. I would continue to use him.
4,"My experience was kind of mixed. My husband actually supervised their visit. He thought they were good and asked them to do more work. I came home and I wasn't happy. The Big Deal was for a set number of hours and my husband wanted them to finish the work so we paid them for extra time. We had a crack in the living room ceiling and whatever he mudded it with, it didn't blend well with the other texture so it was a real obvious repair as opposed to what we were after. Some of the drywall mud had dripped onto the carpet. It just wasn't cleaned up after. In my mind, what I was thinking was a drywaller and drywaller tend to come in on a house that is not finished and they get to be pretty sloppy. But this was work being done in a finished home so I was expecting more. I was anticipating that after he fixed the crack and textured it we would be painting over it. I didn't expect to find a mess on the floor and have to do some clean up. My husband thought that they did a reasonable job. Not a great job but a reasonable job. My husband said they were late but it was justified."
5,"Kjell did a great job! He was able to do work the same day that I called. He was prompt, efficient and pleasant to work with. We will definitely use Kjell in future."
5,They were great. They were efficient. They were very fast.
1,"I called and emailed several times and he responded once, but never followed up and I was never able to schedule anything. I ended up exchanging the Deal for another one."
5,"Full time Servants were wonderful. They showed up on time and were amazingly polite. The spot in the ceiling was in a very awkard spot, and they managed to work it out. We have textured walls and they stayed over to make sure the work was dry before applying the texture. The finished product was amazing. I will use Full Time Servants again for any of our dry wall needs and would recommend them to anyone."
5,"All work was performed well , on time. I have Kjell on my schedule for other handy-man repairs."
5,"Kjell was courteous, prompt and efficient. Got the job done quickly while finding and implementing low-cost solutions. Also eager to show me how to do the repairs myself. I plan to have him do more work on my house."
5,No more leaks. New shower parts and walls look great!
1,"took my money, materials, never completed job"
5,"It was an Angie's List Big Deal that I purchased. It was great and I would highly recommend him. He was very professional, very quick and knowledgeable. I would absolutely use him again."
5,"The service went great; they were communicative and easy to work with. I had a short time frame and they were able to work me in. He missed a fine detail; I saw a corner of old paint still sticking out and it really should have been removed. I don't know why he missed that. He even went to the store to and from my work site to pick up some paint for me; he did not have to do that, so that's really working with me."
4,"I bought the $59 deal from Angie's List for two hours of handyman services. After some initial confusion confirming my appointment, Kjell came out and asked me for a list of what I wanted done. He made sure I got my two hours' worth of time out of him."
5,Kjell was terrific. I would definitely recommend him and will use him for all of the household repairs that may be needed in the future.
5,Everything was done correctly and in a very timely manner. The fee was more than reasonable.
5,"I had been told by more than one person that porcelain tile was tricky to drill through without cracking, so I decided to hire the work out. I needed the work done asap, and even though Kjell was scheduled up for the week, he was able to accommodate my tight schedule by working the job late in the afternoon. The job took about 45 minutes to complete. He used a hammer drill to make the holes for the screw anchors. He then completed the installation of the shower curtain rod and finished the job."
5,Kjell was great and even though we didn’t move forward with the job we will use Kjell for our Handyman needs in the future.
5,I was very pleased with the quality of the work. They cleaned up after themselves and gave me reasonable quotes on some future projects I was thinking of having done.
5,Very pleased all around.
5,He is awesome!!
5,Very good.
3,"The job did not go as anticipated. We had to stay on top of the work, which initially was rather mediocre. We were told that we were too particular, since we wanted the tiles to line up - imagine that!!! Also, anything negative that happened was the customer's fault and not the contractor's. We will never re-hire this contractor or recommend him to any of our friends or associates."
5,"Richard was fantastic. He has excellent communication, work ethic, and quality of work. We are very pleased with the work he did for us and will definitely use him again in the future. It was so nice to have this experience with him after having a bad experience with a previous contractor. I wish we had found Richard sooner. He installed and finished drywall including matching it up with existing plaster which you can’t tell was done like you can sometimes due to the difference in thickness of plaster versus drywall. He also did some carpentry work and painted."
5,Extremely well. Richard arrived on time. Was very professional. Completed the work on time. When necessary on design issues he asked me what I wanted or what I had envisioned for the space. My home turned out perhaps even more esthetically appealing than I knew it would. The new door handles and pulls make me very happy and add joy to my time in my kitchen. I would recommend Richard to anyone.
5,"Perfect! On time, fair, efficient , clean, polite, and got the job done."
5,It went great. Richard is excellent at whatever he does. Very meticulous and quality conscious. Very easy to work with. A very Knowledgeable and nice man
5,"The Deck reconstruction went smoothly even when at the mercy of February 2019's cold and rainy weather. Richard responded to my search promptly. He listened to what I wanted prior to beginning the job and made design suggestions as well. The job was started within weeks and completed in a timely manner with a few delays due to the weather. He hand picked clean, new lumber that had minimal knots. He hand picked new 6x6 beams even when the lumber store wanted him to use older wood. He rounded edges of many of the deck boards for smooth, safe design where the deck aligns with our above ground pool. He took extra care to leave our property presentable at the end of every work day. It was an extreme pleasure working with Richard. He is very friendly man as well as extremely talented handyman. He has good work ethics and meticulous in his work. I would recommend Handyman Unlimited for other handyman jobs."
5,"Richard and his son, as always, did a great job. They were very professional, and pleasant. We will hire them again; and when we sell our house, we will leave his name for the new buyers."
5,Richard did a fantastic job! Very professional and couldn’t have been a nicer guy. I would hire him again.
5,"We were looking for someone who could complete a job that another contractor had not finished, and called Richard after seeing a lot of positive reviews. One or two good reviews could be from family or friends, but many of them is usually a good indicator. And that was the case here. He was prompt and punctual, and did excellent work at reasonable prices. Once he was able to start, he worked on our job exclusively until it was completed. Collaboration with him was both easy and effective. As we get older, having a trusted group of resources becomes more and more important, and we feel that Richard is on that list. The next time we need a handyman, he'll get our first call. Highly recommended."
5,"Reviews of leak repairs must be provisional until proven by a hard rain. Nevertheless I am confident that Richard solved our problem and did it in an affordable and thorough manner. I had to wait several weeks for him to have an opportunity to do the work, but that is no doubt because he is good and has many clients. His work was thorough and I was informed of his progress and any additional problems that were discovered while the repair proceeded. Not only did he repair the rain damage, he traced the problem back to its source and made sure it would not happen again. His work was neat, professional, thorough, of the highest quality. He knows what he is doing. He also documented his work with pictures so that I understood what and why he did certain things. Should I need to, I will certainly use him again and I highly recommend him to anyone needing general handyman services."
5,"Far exceeded our expectations! Richard remodeled our downstairs walkout basement into a lovely rentable studio apartment with a kitchen and full bath, He created a beautiful living, bedroom, kitchen and bath area from a large open space. We couldn't be happier with the quality of work he does!"
5,Richard did a wonderful job on these tasks. He was very professional and personable. We plan to use him again for some larger outside tasks as soon as weather permits. Highly recommend.
5,"Richard did a great job! He arrived on time, got right to work, and even returned unused lumber for me, so I could get a refund for it. I would absolutely hire him again."
5,"Excellent! Richard has done many jobs for us over the years, including painting the house. He is creative, knowledgeable, and completely trustworthy, and his work is always of high quality."
5,"We had previously hired someone to remove popcorn ceiling and paint. They removed it but along the way damaged the sheet rock and said we needed certain areas that were a problem repaired by someone else. We hired Handyman Unlimited and they were incredible. The ceiling looks like glass that's been painted. We were in awe to see how it made a difference. Jenny also suggested we update the crown holding and that was perfect. We ask for some custom work also, a cabinet area built above what use to be a closet. Part of the closet now houses our refrigerator, we wanted a space beside it to be a pantry. Jenny made us a pantry exactly like we wanted, with a very finished look. We wanted a pocket door removed and Jenny suggested we widen the opening at the same time, great idea. She and Jason do not skip to a faster easier way they do everything 120%."
5,"Perfect....excellent work!! Reliable, honest, extremely knowledgable and trustworthy. Could not ask for a better handyman."
5,All the work took 7 days. Richard is a craftsman at his work. He is very knowledgeable in all aspects of home repair. He also gave us ideas on things we can do to help maintain our home.
5,Perfectly! Couldn't have asked for anything better.
5,"Mr. Byers was very responsive, listened to what I asked for and was on time every day. His professionalism was only out done by the quality of his work! From now on if I need something done I will call him."
5,"He did a great job. It was not an easy job as it entailed a lot of little jobs, i.e., plumbing, demolition, reconstruction, wiring and re-wiring, tiling, etc. He did not contract out any job. He, and his son, did it all. We would definitely hire him again. In fact, we plan to use him for another remodel job. He is very personable and definitely knows his craft."
5,Richard and his son did a great job. we love the new bathroom and have had many compliments on it. i would definitely hire him again; and would highly recommend him.
5,They arrived on time. They were friendly and professional. Reasonably priced. Look forward to working with them again.
1,"I called, got answering machine saying my call was important to them and they would call back. They never called back."
5,"Handyman Unlimited Richard remodeled our entire basement. This included installing drywall, trim, painting, demo bathroom, rearranged plumbing for vanity & commode & installed tile & flooring. He was prompt, professional & exhibited quality work. He cleaned up each day so that we had as least amount of debris as possible. He gave some really good suggestions on things we were undecided about. Also, after he finished the job he came back to repair some wall damages caused by a granite installer. We would definitely recommend Richard to others."

5,"Richard was excellent to work with. He is very detail-oriented, and did a fantastic job on our tiled backsplash (about 55sq ft). We will definitely use him on the future. Thanks, Richard!"
5,Richard was polite and very hard-working. He did a neat job and cleaned up after himself every day. I would definitely use him again.
5,"Extremely well; I completely agree with the other reviews. Richard has done many jobs for us over the years (including painting our entire house) and we are always pleased with his work. I very much appreciate his attention to detail and neatness, as well as his creativity in tackling complicated and involved jobs."
5,GREAT!! Richard evaluated and solved a problem for us. He cleaned up behind himself both times he was here. That is the mark of a good workman.
5,"They painted the entire door and when they were finished, it looks new. I can't say enough about how pleased I am at the work done and the price was very reasonable. Thank you Richard and son! You saved me so much money by not having to replace the entire door. I will definitely ask Richard to do more jobs as they arise."
5,"He was very nice. Very punctual, did a very neat job. Cleaned up his mess. Charges were fair and reasonable. I would definitely use him again and recommend him highly."
5,Richard was able to do the job with very short notice. He was accessible and responsive. Very friendly and professional. Did the job quickly and cleaned up afterwards. Very good quality job. Will definitely contact again for future jobs.
5,"The living room has a tongue and groove wood ceiling. It's vaulted and angled with no attic above it. I wanted ceiling fans and recessed lighting installed, but a couple electricians who came out told me the job was impossible. Finally, I found an electrician who came up with a strategy to install the fans and lighting so that the wiring was all tucked up underneath the ceiling -- no ugly wire molding. But the work involved carpentry skills. Paul Murrell (my electrician) and Richard devised a plan that required making a cut along the grooves in order to remove a board. He called Richard Byers to assist him. It was a complex job that no one else was willing to tackle. Together, Richard and Paul managed to do all the work in one day. Their work was meticulous! You can't tell which wood board was cut (they stained the edge to match the existing ceiling so it's invisible). It looks as if the house was designed and built with the fans and lighting. The price was more than fair for the amount of work involved. I'm so impressed and happy with the final result!"
5,"Richard is incredibly efficient and exacting- Other reviews say ""meticulous,"" and I agree. At the end of every day, Richard was sure to clean up and leave all areas neat. He allowed the kitchen to be as useable as possible. He made great recommendations and suggestions. Before adding molding to the ceiling, he had to remove 27 yr old wallpaper border. He did this easily and seemed to have the molding up in no time. I had some very plain, unfinished-looking areas on cabinets and walls that he enhanced with molding, as well. In order to install the backsplash I wanted, he had to take out a cabinet above the microwave so he did this, raised the microwave, and made a box for a future wine rack above the microwave with left-over room. He installed new backsplashes beautifully. Some of the cabinet doors were a bit crooked and the counters were not level. He fixed them, as well. Richard and an electrician friend of his installed canned lighting in the ceiling, added pendant lights, and changed out the chandelier. They also installed under counter lighting and moved outlets for more convenience. Incidentally, they also installed a ceiling fan in a bedroom. Richard has also done many other jobs for me. Recently, he installed a hot tub on my deck, replaced rotten boards, painted the deck, and secured it underneath for the weight of the tub. He installed new railings, as well. Richard power washed the area, including my deck cushions. Richard is as non-invasive as possible by being as quiet as the job allows and by being courteous in manner and approach. He is polite, well-spoken, and seems to enjoy challenging jobs. He is not passive in his thinking, but rather he is always problem-solving and engaged. He wants the customer to be happy with the job he has done. He is happy when he can walk away knowing his customer is satisfied-who wouldn't want someone like him working for them! Richard has family members who can help him when the job calls for more than one person ( such as installing a hot tub). His daughter is a handy-woman by profession and he has sons who help him at times."
5,He did great work and was very friendly.
5,"Once again, Richard did a perfect job as requested - and then some. He even provided some materials so I didn't need to buy extra. This is the third time he has done work for me and he has always been great. He is the best handyman I have ever hired."
5,Great. on time. great quality. very professional.
5,Beautiful work; I'm very happy with it. Thank you Richard !!!
5,"Richard is absolutely METICULOUS. He arrived daily at the time he said he would. He laid tarps from our front door all the way to the master bathroom so he could come and go without getting dirt into the house. He removed the tile from our shower and showed us exactly what the problem was that caused the leak and explained what needed to be done to fix it. It was very apparent that he is a master plumber/carpenter/handyman. He gave suggestions on what kind of tile to look for and how to match it to the original tile as best as possible. The job required that the tile be removed from the entire shower from waist height....down. Richard jack-hammered everything out all the way to the subfloor and showed us what was happening to cause the leak. He removed all of the rotting/molded wood and replaced everything in between the floors. He used the highest quality materials and explained to us every step and why he was doing it. He reworked the drain that was not draining properly. The previous installers had used ROOFING NAILS to nail down the cement board with no glue. Richard explained to us that a special type of screw was supposed to be used WITH a special kind of glue to keep the screws from coming out and cracking the grout (when the floor expands and contracts due to temperature changes). He showed us numerous other things that had been done incorrectly and showed us how he was addressing each issue. At the end of each day, Richard cleaned and shop vacuumed his way out of the bathroom all the way to the front door and left virtually no trace that he had been there. Richard came back at the end of the job and sealed the tile and grout. He was kind, courteous, and well spoken. Our shower looks even better than it did when it was first renovated and I know it will last a lifetime due the meticulous work ethic of this handyman. This was the most positive experience we have ever had with a home maintenance person. It was worth every penny to have this peace of mind. Richard is awesome and we highly recommend him. Jeff and Kathy Holden"
5,"I called the cell telephone number while Richard was out of town He returned my call promptly We discussed what services I needed at my home.When he returned to Phoenix we made an appointment for him to give me an estimate. We discussed the work needed and Richard came back the next morning to do the job. it took less than an hour, it was done quickly and professionally, Richard is personable, I would use his services again,"
5,"We did not use this provider; however, Handyman Unlimited was very professional and prompt in giving a bid on services. We would definitely use them in the future."
5,"The experience was excellent (the best we have had) the work was on time, on budget with done with great care and neatness. We had been referred to Richard by a friend and he was as advertised. We highly recommend Richard and have asked him to bid on another project and are looking forward to working with him in the future."
5,"You need to know that Richard is WONDERFUL. He remodeled our master bathroom in three weeks, never missing a day of work there, always giving it his best effort, always pleasant and kind. He gave us great advice concerning elements of the renovation, and took pride in every element of his work. The end result is an absolutely beautiful brand new bathroom that we will enjoy for years, and we are so thankful that we chose Richard to be the one to remodel it!!"
5,"You just cannot go wrong with Richard and his daughter. Period. He was out to our home quickly to examine the work to be done. Courteous, pleasant, neat, very focused and meticulous. Condition of his truck and work trailer bespoke professionalism. Takes great pride in his work. More than a handyman, he is a craftsman. He was prompt every day. He kept a very clean worksite and took great care to ensure that he did not damage the home interior in any way. He welcomed questions, no matter how ""dumb"", and he was extremely patient in explaining his procedures as he went along. The work took four days, and during that time I found additional honey-do items that were not on the original agenda. Richard cheerfully added those jobs without any qualms whatsoever. He was very careful to ensure that he closed doors, as our cat is an ""indoors cat"" with no front claws. The match between the color of paint and the existing siding was excellent. There were several other items needing attention at a later date, and Richard was freely providing advice on what I could do about them or what he would do if I hired him again. We have had our home for 17 years. I've had many repairs/upgrades done to the structure and appliances and HVAC. While I've dealt with some exceptional folks providing those services, Richard is at the top of the list. I expect to pay a higher price for top quality that lasts; with Richard I received top quality AND a very reasonable price. You simply cannot go wrong with this service--I already have another list for Handyman Unlimited! And I have that peace of mind knowing that whatever happens in the future, I do not have to wade through the yellow pages or Angie's List or word-of-mouth to find someone to handle the work. With complete confidence, I'll just give Richard a call."
5,Everything we discussed was addressed professionally.
5,"Richard is non-stop and I really like the way he does work, he is very clean and efficient and I wouldn't use anyone else."
5,"It went wonderfully. He is like full blast all the time; he never slows down or takes breaks. He’s amazing guy. The pricing is good. He is incredibly nice, an all-around good guy. He is very polite. He doesn’t waste any time and he’s extremely knowledgeable."
3,We did not get past the initial phone call because he said he was too busy and booked until summer and referred us to his daughter. He really seemed more interested in getting business for his daughter than anything else. We chose not to call her because she is not on Angie's List and we decided to call someone else.
5,"Richard is an absolute professional and joy to work with. He is utmost of meticulous, very detail focused and wants his work to be perfect! Which it is!!! I am very particular about how I want things done and Richard is more particular than I am which allowed me to relax about the entire project. We needed some painting done in addition to the tile work which we thought had been hired out to another contractor, that fell through. We asked if Richard if he could complete the work; though he was scheduled for another job he said he would make sure it would be completed either by him or his daughter Jenny. Jenny came and evaluated the project and gave us a quote that we felt was reasonable and she started the next day. Both Jenny and Richard's work is flawless. We have other projects we would like to consider for the future and we will definitely call on them to complete! Thank you!!!"
5,"Richard Byers worked in our home almost every day for several weeks. His daughter asisted him routinely during this time. They were very prompt and professional, and extremely nice people who were very easy to work with. We were completely comfortable during the entire process having them in our home alone. We were pleasantly surprised how clean their work was, especially involving the replacement of the popcorn ceiling. There was almost no dust involved. Their painting work was excellent, on ceilings and walls. Richard did an excellent job on the bathrooms, and we are very pleased with the tile work in all areas. He is very skilled in renovation work. One of the most important things to us was that virtually all work was done by Richard and his daughter, so we did not have to worry about dealing with a lot of different workers/service providers. As time went on, they became more like friends than just a service provider. Both my wife and I felt very comfortable asking any questions, requesting changes in the work, etc. and Richard was always polite and accomodating. He never answered our questions or requests in a condescending manner, which is something we have experienced with other service providers in the past. In summary, we would recommend Handyman Unlimited to anyone needing this type of work, and we had an excellent experience. We plan to use Handyman Unlimited again in the near future for additional work on our house."
4,"No work was commissioned since we needed the work done immediately, not in six months."
4,"The owner of Handyman Unlimited was busy doing other jobs and could not come when I called. He mentioned that he had taught his daughter Jenny, who works with him, and she could do job. We agreed to have her call me and I hired her. He taught her well, Jenny did a very good job."
5,Jenny came out and gave us an estimate for the work and then came back the next day and did the initial work. She returned once the grout had dried to finish the job and it looks great!
5,"Richard called before he came, he was punctual, and he completed the work easily. He clarified what he was going to do before he started. He has worked for me several times over the past five years on both small and large ""punch lists"" and has always been professional. He says that he tries to complete work on others' homes as he would want his to be done. He is very neat and he cleans up at the end of the day so that one would never know he had been there except that the work done looks exceptional. He is worth the wait that sometimes occurs because he is so busy. When he is actually working on a home, the homeowner would never know that he is busy because he takes his time to accomplish the job in the best manner possible. I highly recommend Richard Byers. You will not be disappointed!"
1,"See the details above in the ""What did the provider do"" section."
3,"He arrived promptly after we made initial contact. He gave us a quote & an estimate for cost. He also told us when the work would be done. However, he did not show up & when we called, he told us he was very busy & would have to delay our job. It was not a good experience. We would rather pay more for a repair & get the job done than to get the run around from a contractor. It makes us hesitant to find another repair person through your service."
5,"Richard and his helper (daughter jenny) was great. Did the work on time, made the drogues we discussed repaired all was focused on the job and finished all that was needed. He went beyond above!!!"
5,The worked was thoroughly completed and we are very happy with the results.
5,"RIchard quoted labor only for me so that I could purchase the materials I wanted. I had lots of questions about the projects which he answered patiently and thoroughly. Since I could not be at the house, I left him a key. He arrived when he said he would, did a great job with all projects and cleaned up after himself. He also gave me some great tips on projects I'm doing myself. I hope to get him to do more work for me soon. Very pleased!"
5,"We were thrilled with the work performed. Richard had integrity, was prompt and courteous. He cleaned up everyday of the job. He ensured that sealants dried properly before laying tiles on them. He made minor repairs throughout the house for us so quickly and efficiently. He insisted on completing the work before receiving any pay. My husband was a licensed contractor in the past and he loved everything Richard did. We are very confident that the job is now done right! I will definitely hire him again in the future. Thank you Angie's List for this referral!"
5,"Richard knows his business! He created an opening in the wall between my kitchen and living room that looks as though it has always been there. His carpentry and painting cannot be beaten, and he is well-mannered and well-spoken. He was not bothered by my curious beagle, and acknowledged him each time he came in. I was pleased with his professionalism. He always answered my questions about his process and progress kindly. I recommend his work highly."
5,"Richard has performed many jobs for me for the past four years. He has cut down trees, repaired my deck,put new railings around my deck, built a raised garden bed, painted the trim on my house and replaced rotten wood where necessary. He has also done maintenance on outside tools and he has power washed the house several times. He has replaced gutters that were chewed by squirrels and he has cleaned my gutters twice a year. He helped me design a front porch railing that was elaborate and unique and then he built it. Inside, Richard has worked on my bathrooms by changing the floors to tile, replaced toilets, and built frames for around my mirrors. He added chair railing, and has done some minor electrical work. He also repaired my indoor window shutters. No job seems too big or too small for him. He is extremely efficient and thorough and he cleans up so that you would never know he has been here.He completes work that would take other handymen a week in half that time. Everything is done with expertise. Richard's daughter occasionally helps and she is also very professional. I have no qualms about leaving him in my home and I usually just give him a key that he keeps until the job is done. I trust him completely."
5,"Richard was very responsive and did a great job. Timely with his estimate and with the work.. The refinishing was superior to the previous work done. The cleaning and washing were very well done. He also fixed other things that came up during the work, like the leak. I will certainly use him again and have recommended him to friends."
5,"Richard really helped us out of a jam this week when another drywall contractor who had given us the runaround for a week, finally fell through completely. With new kitchen countertops on order and with a short window until their install date, Richard was able to step in on short notice and install drywall in our kitchen. He estimated a very fair price for the job, showed up when he said he would, was obviously knowledgeable and experienced as he explained the steps in the process. He used the correct materials for a ‘wet’ area, thinking of details that we had not previously considered, and worked quickly and efficiently. He did a great job, and left the kitchen neat and tidy every day, which is no small chore when working with drywall! We are so grateful for his help on this project, and would definitely work with him again."
5,"We were redoing our kitchen and I was serving as the General Contractor. I was looking for a painter to remove the popcorn ceiling and repair drywall where a pantry was removed. I quickly learned that Richard could do everything and so I added lots of extra jobs to his list. He was dependable and very, very thorough. Whatever he did, he did very well and with professionalism. He gave suggestions and I felt like he was an expert in his field. He was very clean and neat and left the house having cleaned up whatever mess was made. I felt very comfortable leaving the house and not feeling I had to supervise. One day I called him from Sears to ask about the kind of ice maker line to purchase. After he installed the dishwasher he ran a cycle to make sure there were no leaks and the same with the faucet and ice-maker. I will definitely use him again. In fact, I am waiting on a quote for some outdoor repairs."
3,This was a case where I let myself get drawn in by all the positive hype I read about some of Richards previous jobs and trusted him because of that. I did not get him to break down individually the costs for the 4 different jobs I needed done but accepted a total estimate. When I decided to remove the 2 remaining jobs after he had finished the first 2 he only reduced his final invoice slightly from his original bid on the 4 jobs. I didnt argue as I was the one who failed to get him to break done the jobs individually by cost -but $120/hour for pressure washing and wall paper removal-come on man! Dont make the mistake I made -get a separate estimate for every single job you have Richard do and then get someone else to give you an estimate and I bet it will be a lot cheaper for the same average quality.
5,"This was a great experience. Richard called me when he arrived at my home. When I arrived he had already started on the project. He was able to salvage some of the railings and replace many of the others. He raised the canopy level on the porch by an inch. He took the time to explain that some of the replacement pieces need to dry before they could be repainted. He remained until he was sure that I understood the next steps. When he left, you couldn't tell he was there - other than the brilliant woodwork done on the porch. He IS my go to Handyman - period!"
5,"Excellent. Could not have gone better. Richard was prompt and considerate in his timing and communications. He stuck to his cost estimate and time frame. My one hesitation in recommending Richard is that he might get so busy, we'd have a hard time getting him back to do more stuff. He's that good!!!"
5,"Did not get very far, but my experience with Richard was definately a good one. I can only hope that he will be available when I revist the projects."

5,"This was my second time using Handyman Unlimited (Richard Byers) services. I was as pleased this time as I was the first time both in the quality of work and the overall cost. Both times I have used Richard's services, his daughter assisted him. This time his daughter assisted mostly with painting and did an excellent job. Richard was always on time, professional, attentive to details and delivered a quality product. I especially liked the fact that Richard would make suggestions on the work I needed to have done, but not in a pushy way. I appreciated his recommendations as he has been doing this type of work for years. I will definitely call on Richard for any future needs. In fact, I am having new front/back entry doors installed on Monday 6/11/12. Richard has already agreed to paint both doors after they are installed. I will contact him on Tuesday 6/11/12 to determine a date.I also have plans this year to paint the interior of my house. I will definitely contact Richard when I get ready to do that. One last comment. I do feral cat rescue and have several cats in my house as well as a colony of cats outside. This is a passion of mine and the cats inside the house absolutely cannot go outside. Richard was very sensitive to this and understands that any service he performs, such as the upcoming painting of the interior of my house, will most likely have to be done in phases. I have to secure the inside cats in 2 different rooms while painting is being done in the other rooms. I very much appreciate his sensitivity to my ""special"" needs."
5,"He also cuts our azalea bushes, fixes our appliances, and does anything else we need. He is very good. I give him an ""A"" overall."
5,"Absolutely awesome. Richard and his daughter were wonderful to work with. The remodel started thee weeks ago, every day I was amazed at the transformation! The baths were even cleaned at the end! They asked my input on everything they did. The even repainted areas when I was not pleased with MY paint choice. Richard even hung shades at no extra cost. His workmanship is superior! I knew he was the one to choose and am very happy!!!!! I have already recommended him to coworkers!"
5,"Richard is an amazing workman. He leaves no detail undone. He cleans up every day. He was here about 15 days to complete this job. I found him on Angies List. (joining was best thing I did) My words can not adequately describe all the work he did and the beautiful, wonderful bathroom I now have. I am handicapped and I can now - unassisted- use my bathroom/shower alone. Everything that I need for my shower is done- grab bars, in wall shelf, no lip on floor entry to shower - floor slopes into shower basin . Richard did so much more than I am able to describe. My finished project is everything I asked for and more."
5,"Professional and courteous, fair estimate, prompt and professional / very good quality work; highly recommended, would call again"
5,"He did more than I could even of asked him to do. I even gave him an extra $1,000 on top of what he charged. All of his work is amazing. He is honest and happy all the time. I wish we had more people like him in our area."
5,Very professional and nice.
5,Very professional and nice.
5,Perfect True professional A++
5,All work was completed on time. Great attention to detail and getting everything just right. Outstanding job. Estimate was inline with the actual cost. I have and would recommend this business.
5,"Richard was very pleasant, courteous, professional and knowledgable. He showed up on time every day and was very meticulous about the detail of his work, while doing his best to cause a minimal disturbance to the household. He cleaned up everyday and gave me routine progress reports and happily answered my questions and offered advice. On top of all of this his price was very competetive and unlike most contractors he provided an accurate estimate within a few days time! This experience is the very reason my family joined Angie's List! We researched about five different companies/people about the work based on reviews and ended up with fantastic work done at a very good price! I highly recommend Richard and Handyman Unlimited!"
5,"This company has worked for us a total of 3 times. The 1st time, I found the company on Angie's List and had them construct a handicap ramp for my husband who had just had a serious accident. I specified that I wanted the ramp to be removable after my husband;s recovery. Because I needed the ramp quickly, they gave this job top priority and got it done right away. Richard did a marvelous job and came back 9 months later to take it down when we needed him to. Next I asked for an estimate to have a complete bathroom overall- I wanted a 1960's long narrow bath to be gutted and become handicap accessible and I wanted a walk in shower. The completed job is beautiful and the price was excellent. There was a large amount of tiling involved: shower walls, decorative trim and a shower insert as well as the entire floor. Richard is very precise- he makes sure he gets it right. He had never done the type of sloped floor we needed in the shower and he did considerable research to do it correctly. (that part had me nervous because if the slope isn't correct there would be major problems. He did it perfect). I also appreciated how they cleaned up after themselves every single day. On his 3rd visit in the spring of this year, we had several small jobs done- fixing a door, taking down the ramp and storing it, etc. If you are in a hurry for a job to get done, be cautious: it WILL get done and done right, but maybe not on your time schedule. We will continue to call this company for other jobs."
5,"Richard came over to fix a leak. Thought he had it fixed, but it still leaked. He came back a second time, found the problem and fixed it. He then came over when we had a big rain to make sure it was not leaking. He only charged his original fee. Richard goes beyond what you would expect from a repair person. He is very professional. I highly recommend him. Ben Miller"
5,Services performed as agreed upon in a timely & professional manner.
5,"Very meticulous, makes everything right and I loved all of it! Completed it like it had never never been harmed. Daughter does painting and it was excellent."
4,"Richard was kind enough to go beyond his usual service area to give me an estimate on a variety of home repairs. He made me aware of a $40 fee at the time we first spoke. He went to the property and promptly provided me with a verbal quote of the estimate of his work (via telephone). However, he did not send me a written, detailed listing. While I appreciated his punctual response, I found the quote too high and lacking in specifics. Therefore, I did not choose to contract him to perform the work."
5,Excellent excellent job. Good work guys:))!!!
5,He is very prompt and polite. He is honest and dresses neat and clean. He does not waste any time. He will go and purchase supplies and come back and do the work and he is fast.
5,"Richard was prompt in getting back to me with the initial contact and then with the estimate. The estimate was provided on 6/19/11, and the work began the following day on Monday, 6/20/11. My punch list included both interior and exterior jobs. Richard was leaving for a trip on 6/20/11, and had informed me that his 2 adult children who work with him, would perform the exterior tasks for me on Monday, 6/20/11. His son called me first thing Monday morning and established a start time, and they showed up right on time. They were both very pleasant and professional. They began work about 9:30 am and finished around 3:30 pm the same day. I was very pleased with the work they did, the time it took them to complete the work, and the cost. As soon as Richard returns from his trip, he will contact me to setup a time to complete the interior jobs we discussed. I will submit a separate report when that work is completed. So far, I can say that I would, and will, use this service again in the future."
5,"Richard was great. He provided a very detailed estimate and did the work exactly as he said he would. In fact, in many cases he went above and beyond the estimate and did work that was not specified just because he saw that it needed to be done. He was on the job 100% of the time which was a plus for us when selecting him. His adult children work with him so they have the same work ethic as him. Have to say it took a few days longer than some of the bigger paint companies, but his scope of work is much greater and the quality and attention to detail was well worth the wait."
5,The work was professional and detail oriented and it was not an easy job on an older house to make everything fit.
5,"Exchanged calls, gave an estimate for the above. As Richard was doing the work I tried to stay out of the way but wanted to see what he was doing and how he was doing the work and to see the damage behind the obvious exterior damage. He and his son were very patient, covered the work in detail gave their opinion on what needed to be done and the cost of additional work if we wanted it done. Part of the problem was my delay in calling in the first place as the professionals we have called before Angie's list weren't. At least two are out of business but onward we go. Delay and the problems gets worse. I believe the problems addressed above have been fixed and the work is first rate. Found one additional nail in the driveway but the site was left very clean. Have other jobs to be done and we will give Richard the first call. Great Value."
5,"Richard did an outstanding job. He can repair anything. He repaired a door that others said could not be repaired. He is a true craftsman. If you want the job done right at a fair cost, he's your man."
5,Very well. We used his services before and knew what to expect. Richard is a very nice person to deal with.
5,"Richard came out to look at the job exactly when he said he would and called within the day with the estimate- excellent workmanship, gave helpful suggestions for the design and finished the work quickly knowing that we had a time issue. The ramp was completed in one day. We were thoroughly pleased with the project and would definitely use his company again."
5,"The experience was wonderful. He came out and listened to everything that I was wanting. He gave some really good helpful tips. He listened patiently and was right on time. Everything was wonderful but I hadn't budgeted for the $1,000. I only had budgeted $700 so I am doing a portion of the work myself and then I am definitely going to give him a call back to come and finish up. I really had a lot of confidence in what he was telling me. The estimate he gave was totally in line."
5,Everything went as planned. The job took the estimated time. The labor estimate was very close to final price and I thought it was a fair price. The materials that The Handyman purchased seemed somewhat high. I should have asked for receipts. I would say the work was exceptional. The Handyman pays a lot of attention to detail. I would call him again.
5,"Glad I found Richard. This was a project that I thought I might be able to do myself. I am certainly glad I did not take it on. After Richard tore into the project, we found electrial outlets had to be moved, heating ducts had to be moved and the door opening had to be cut just right. There is no way I could have done it. Richard did a first class job. He did the construction, electrical, pumbing, everything. He cleaned up each day. He was right on with his quote for the job. I would highly recommend this company."
5,"He is fantastic. Others in the know who have seen his work have agreed that his craftsmanship is superb. He is reliable, communicative, upfront, and very talented at what he does."
5,"They did an excellent job and we were very pleased with the service. The thing I like most about this contractors is, that he can do everything. He did so much work and it is all great. He was here a lot and the whole time he was pleasant to have around. I would recommend him based on the quality of his work and his prices are reasonable as well."
5,OVER THE YEARS I HAVE USED THIS COMPANY FOR ALL MY HANDYMAN NEEDS. THEY DO EVERYTHING FOR ME. I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISSATISFIED WITH THEIR WORK. THEY DO A GREAT JOB.
5,Very nice work.

5,"They were professional, dependable, affordable and friendly."
5,"Our 30 year old forced air furnace was costly to run and not efficient. From estimate to installation and a follow up visit to explain the finer points of our system, everyone was courteous, hardworking and reliable. We use Williamson's for service for all our heating and cooling needs. They are highly recommended."
5,"The service was excellent, came the next day, at the right time, knew the problem and fixed it immediately, exterior wiring issue that was repaired and got fixed."
5,"Rob the owner was very polite and honest , answered all my questions and concerns. His crew Daniel,mike,and Walter right on time very professional and outgoing,every step of the way was explained. They went above and beyond kept everything cleaned no messes . I overall would recommend Williamson’s heating & cooling to anyone that’s looking for an amazing honest local company and his team of wonderful employees.If u want the job done right the first time then Williamson’s heating & cooling. Thank you team"
5,"Williamson's installed the first HVAC system in my house in 1996. I got 23 years of operation out of it, with very few problems. Williamson's did all of the yearly service and the minor repairs that were invariably needed due to the age of the system. I hired them to replace the system and to replace the ducting in my house. They handled the complete transaction, from the initial inspection and estimate, through the installation and the follow-up very professionally. The installation was done with a minimum of disruption, and done very diligently. The crew was courteous and professional. They took care to protect my floors and walls, and cleaned up at the end of every day. During the replacement of the ducting in my attic (which is not a fun thing to do!), they accidentally caused some damage to my house. After the installation was completed, they immediately followed-up with the repair of the damage and provided a contract letter to indicate that if any other latent damage is discovered, they will accept responsibility and repair. I could not have asked for better service throughout the whole process. I have a long history with Williamson's and have always been completely satisfied with their service. They are honest and forthright and do excellent work. I have always found their prices to be reasonable. They may be a little more expensive than some other HVAC contractors, but the quality of their systems and their service is worth the cost. I highly recommend them."
5,"Absolutely superb response and service! Now our ""go-to"" company for HVAC and electric needs. Outside A/C unit malfunctioned Friday night. Called 1st thing Sat morning (8ish), received call within an hour for expected arrival time (noon), tech (Dave*) called and arrived a little before noon, diagnosed problem and buttoned up unit within 45 min. Reasonable labor rates given a weekend overtime situation in 100+ degree weather. *Professional, courteous, extremely knowledgeable and personable to boot!"
5,"The people at Williamson are outstanding from the office person to the installers. We have never had any service comparable to the service by the Williamson crew. They were fantastic and very professional in every aspect. The four installed: Quincy, Chris, Rene, and Devon were great, super attitude, very respectful of our property, did a great install....very professional. It has been one week today since the install and all seems to going well. We are very pleased with Williamson's and would highly recommend them."
5,Work was done well and cleaned up as they worked.
5,"We called Williamson's on a Saturday morning, and Walter (service technician) came out that day. Problem diagnosed and the system back in operation that day. A follow-up visit today made all the necessary adjustments to make sure the system runs smooth and healthy through the rest of the summer. So -- initial install = great job; service call = great job."
5,Repair was done quickly and efficiently
5,"I needed to have the work done in the spring because the wiring was also ruined and it controlled my swamp coolers as well. The technicians checked that the furnace worked (as did I), but I didn't really use it until more than six months later. It didn't seem to be working as well as I hoped, so I called Williamson's who promptly scheduled the service manager to come out. He looked at the furnace and told me that it was missing a part (to hold the filter) and further that it had not been sealed off properly. I was astounded at his honesty, although I shouldn't have been, because all of my interactions with this company have been extremely positive (unlike virtually every other heating and cooling company I have ever had). He also diagnosed and fixed a squealing noise that sometimes appeared when the furnace was running (furniture partially blocking a duct). They had to order the part, and their excellent technician, Walter, came out, installed it and sealed off the bottom of the furnace (which required climbing into a very tiny space). He did a fantastic job!"
5,"My existing air conditioning unit was old, noisy, and used R-22 refrigerant, which was becoming very expensive to acquire. I decided to update the A/C and furnace ahead of an outage in the worst of summer. I put out for three bids. Williamson's was the most professional of the three when it came to evaluating the job and providing the bid. The proposal was clear and concise, and the bottom-line number quoted was exactly what I ended up paying. There were no hidden fees or surprise extra charges. The installation was performed across the span of two days, which means that it was properly scheduled and not rushed (given the amount of work to be done, a one-day install is a questionable proposition). The two installers -- Josh and Randall -- were professional, courteous, and very hard-working young men. Their attention to detail was very good. The job is now complete. Today was when the owner of Williamson's came out to do a final post-install inspection of the work to make certain all was done properly. The professional nature of the dealings with Williamson's made the entire experience a positive one. In an industry with many who seek to make a quick dollar and leave, I found the opposite to be true with Williamson's ... they strike me as straight-up, professional business people. That is a very good thing."
5,They knew exactly what was wrong and fixed it. They cleaned the unit completely and explained to me everything they were doing. They diagnosed the problem and told me what part it needed and how much it would cost. It went just like they said. Very nice service repairman. I promised to hire them to come and service my air conditioner compressor in March.
5,Excellent. Very good follow up service.
2,"Poorly. The initial appointment was great. The salesman showed up and appeared to be very professional and knowledgeable. I knew they would be finalists based on reputation and the quality of the initial consult. The problem is that I never received the quote, despite letting them know that I wanted to start the work within a week or two (it was very hot outside still). I called back after two weeks and was told that I would receive my quote that day. Two weeks later, I went with a competitor and ended up replacing both heat pumps. Two months later, I'm still not in receipt of a quote."
5,They showed up on time and did a great job! We have used them several times and they are always there when they say they're going to be and always do a good job. They are very knowledgeable and informative and I would and have highly recommended their services to others.
5,"We had previously called another heating company who spent over an hour trying to diagnose the problem. They finally came back with an estimate of over $1,000 for repair but strongly recommended a new furnace. We then called Williamson (based primarily on their Angie's List rating) and the experience was great. They came out immediately, diagnosed the problem within 15 minutes, had the part in stock, and installed it the next morning. Great service and I would recommend them highly."
5,"I decided I wanted an installer that had been approved for the Tucson Electric Power (TEP) rebate program. This is a wonderful way to ensure that you are getting a top notch installation, which is critical for a system to work at peak performance. Hence, I checked the TEP website and got a list of authorized dealers. I then crossed referenced those dealers with the Angie's List top contractors and selected three to bid on the job. Needless to say, I selected Williamson's. Williamson's lived up to their reviews. Initially, Wally came to test my old system for the TEP rebate. After filling up the condenser with refrigerant, the system tested OK for the maximum rebate - $850. Williamsons also gave me an Angie's List discount and a discount for a cash payment, which made their price the best of all the bids. With the refrigerant added, the system limped along until the following week when Wally returned with an assistant to do the job. They easily handled a couple of minor glitches and completed the job as promised with no evidence (except wonderful AC) that they had even been there! TEP is sending an inspector next week to confirm that the job was done as they specified for maximum efficiency. I am completely comfortable that I received the best possible installation and will have a worry free AC and heating system. I highly recommend Williamson's and the TEP program."
5,"I have had Williamson's working on my A/C Heating unit for about six years and knew that eventually it would have to be replaced, and that time came this August.. Over the years I developed a trust in their expertise as their service calls were always on time and very professional. Dave came out on 27 July and told me that it is time to start thinking of replacement as the one of the coils is shot and is leaking Freon badly, 4 1/2 pounds in the last two months. I asked Dave to work up a proposal for me and I had it the next day. I also got three other proposals. Williamson's proposal was not the lowest but within $200.00 of the lowest so I decided to go with Williamson's because of the trust factor knowing that they would handle this promptly and in a professional manner. Made my decision on 30 Jul and signed the contracts. They even included a free two year maintenance plan at the contract signing. The unit had to be ordered and was scheduled to be installed on 10 Aug. The wait was not an issue since my current unit was working and Dave would keep it going at no cost to me until the new unit is installed. On 10 Aug John Paul and Devon arrived at 9:30, as promised, and removed the old roof-top unit and installed the new unit, explained the operation of the new unit, answered all my questions and cleaned up the work site and were gone by 12:45. It could not have gone better. John Paul and Devon were very knowledgeable and very professional not only in the way they did their work but the way they conducted themselves in their interaction with me and my wife. In fact , over the years with Williamson's, every technician that came out to work on my A/C unit was very professional in their work but also treated me, the customer, with respect. That is important to any customer. Their entire staff is professional and easy to talk with. All in all I would definitely hire them again and highly recommend Williamson's to anyone."
5,"The staff at Williamson is a great group of people to install and maintain your AC equipment. We had a defect in one of our units, Williamson's staff ordered the part and responded the day the part arrived. I cannot recommend them enough."
5,"What a pleasure it was to work with this company! They came out quickly to provide an estimate, gave me estimates on two options (either they provide the heat pump system, or I do), and did the work within the next few days. Every person I talked to was pleasant and professional. Both the estimator and the installers arrived when they said they would. The installers explained what they would be doing and then did it, including taking away two old nonfunctional units. They cleaned up and before they left showed me how to operate the system. For years I have been trying to find a heating and cooling company like Williamson's! Unlike all the other companies I have used, this was a positive experience from start to finish. I highly recommend them and will use them for all my heating and cooling needs!"
5,"On 2/03/ 2015 Mr. John Paul Kammeyer came to our house for an estimate and he arrived on time. He took all the necessary measurements, answered with patience and knowledge to our many, many questions and discussed with us, in detail, the equipment options, the installation, the warranties, the TEP program and answered every question we had and more. After two days he emailed the estimate, followed by a hard copy in the mail. Of course, after we got the estimate we realized that we had many more questions which he addressed entirely during our phone conversations. What I want to emphasize is his work ethic, professionalism and a deep, deep knowleadge of the equipment, functionality and the science behind all of this. He is a very honest individual, warm, willing to help, and he encouraged us to call him each time we have a question. There is nothing fake about him, and what he says and promisees it is exactly what is going to happen. He had never tried to deceive or push us. On 2/10/2015, after we had a clear picture of what we want and the cost involved, we went to the office and signed the contract. Everyone at the office was very courteous and helpful. The work was scheduled for 2/16/2015. The crew of four people arrived on time and split because each person had a specific, designated job to do. The installation team was led by Devon who is a very knowledgeable and competent person. The next day a crew of only two people was necessary to continue and again they showed up on time. They once more worked the whole day toward finishing the job. During the installation Mr. Kammeyer came by to observe the progress and intervene if it were necessary. The job was finished on 2/18/2015 and the work was clean, very detailed and proficient. Devon explained how each equipment functions, gave us the manuals, instructed us in programming the thermostat and of course answered many of our questions. Him and his team were very professional, courteous and hard workers. After the final test was performed and sent to TEP, Devon was able to tell us that TEP approved $850.00. Williamson's Heating and Cooling deducted this amount from the final price listed above before billing us. On 2/25/2015 Mr. Kammeyer came for a final inspection and to address any additional questions or concerns we might had. We are extremely pleased with our choice of contractor and the work they've done. We recommend Williamson's Heating and Cooling to anyone who wants a trustworthy, qualified contractor."
5,"We first hired Williamson's Heating and Cooling to take care of our HVAC when we purchased our house in 2000. We had two air conditioners and two furnaces, the original systems from when the house was built in 1991, and Dave did a great job of keeping them both running well despite their age. We decided to replace them with energy efficient units to reduce our monthly costs as well as take advantage of TEP rebates. Williamson's did a fantastic job all around, from explaining the benefits of upgrading, to testing and installing the systems, to getting us the highest rebates possible. Devon and his crew were excellent; very easy to work with and the new systems look spotless - they did a lot of extra cleanup of both areas before installing the equipment. We highly recommend Williamson's Heating and Cooling - it's a great company to work with!"
5,"I am totally satisfied with the work performed by Williamson's Heating & Cooling. John arrived on time and informed me of the process involved before he began. The job, from start-to-finish, was problem free. I really trust this company. When i make the switch to AC, I will be giving them a call!"
5,Very thorough. He took his time in the inspection. He found that the tenants from h*** had shoved newspaper in the heating vent. He told us where we could buy filters. We bought an annual system wellness contract
5,"I first started out doing research on which brand of split-type AC I wanted; then from Mitsubishi's web site I found which certified providers they had here in Tucson. From there I went straight to Angie's List and reviewed what the members had to say about each... Based on that read I selected Williamson's. Selling the system was not needed as I knew what I wanted, I just wanted to discuss the system (and get a quote) before I hired them for the job. John Paul was prompt and very professional... The information he provided and his non-pushy approach was enough for me to sign up to get it done, which just happened to be the very next day. Wally and Bill showed up around 10 am and wrapped up around 4:30 pm. They were both very professional and down right nice guys. I directed them to the rooms that the units were to go in and they took it from there. It was clear that this wasn't their 1st rodeo... as far as I could tell they had a game plan and pulled it off without any hiccups. Once completed they even painted the conduit covers with paint I had left over. They cleaned up everything and even washed the windows... other than having a great new system installed, one would never even know they were here. Wally and Bill spoke very highly of Williamson's as a company, which was great to hear; they are a credit to Williamson's and I expect I'll be adding another split-type AC to our master br in the months ahead and Willianson's will get the call. They even did a check on my main AC system while they were here. I am very pleased! One last thing... I was just kidding about them washing my windows. Cheers!"
5,"We have 2 AC units on our house. The old units had been in place about 13 years. We were dreading the day the units needed to be replaced and had been nursing them along the past 3 years, replacing parts here and there, hobbling by. It became evident it was time to replace them when both units ceased within a few days of each other.I had 3 companies come out to bid. We wanted someone withthe right combination of experience and equipment. We had done some research of AC brands and liked all we?d found about American Standard. In the end we went with Williamson's Heating & Cooling. (I found them on Angie?s List and had no prior affiliation). All the folks at Williamson?s are very professional, knowledgeable and friendly - and they were able to qualify us for TEP rebates most other companies cannot get through the ?CheckMe? program. (Honestly, their prices BEFORE rebates were very competitive!). Robbie (the owner) came out to give the estimate. I did not even realize until a half hour into the conversation that he is the owner ? a very unassuming, nice man who knows his business. The installers, Devon and Alan were also very professional and friendly and were happy to answer all of my questions. They worked very efficiently over 2 days to install both units. The new 17 Seer American Standard units are impressive and I swear I am feeling airflow that did not exist before! I am excited to finally see the efficiency increase and our utility bills decrease! Based on my experience with Williamson's Heating & Cooling, I highly recommend them."
5,"I was thoroughly impressed with the company, from the moment that I called to receive a quote and schedule the service. Williamson's provided a next day appointment. While there was a large window for the service, 1-4PM, the company called to inform me that the technician was running ahead of schedule and could be there earlier. They provided me with a 30 minute lead time to get home, they were waiting when I arrived. The service took no more than an hour and a half, the technician, Andy, was polite and respectful. I would recommend them in the future."
5,"Jean Paul did a great job on the estimate, recommending a unit that would provide the best Seer rating without replacing my heater. He provided an itemized list with the proposal. The only complaint I have is the installers thought the unit was to stay on the ground when the proposal stated it should go on the roof, but that issue was resolved before the guy with the crane left. Still, the installers should have had a copy of the work order with them. Not every item listed was performed but I trust the installers had their reasons. I did ask that the unit run as quietly as possible and Williamsons did well on accommodating me. They sent Wally and Allen out and they muffled the noise the air turbulence created in the return duct, metered it to be sure I was getting the right air flow, pulled out the motor on the heater, cleaned off the dust on the heater motor, and added foam around something there. It made a difference."
5,"changed air filters checked coolant level, and air pressure"
5,Went well and has worked well for 7 yrs
5,"We did have to pay the weekend rate, but we were happy to do so, given how hot it was. The cost was reasonable, and the repairs were quickly performed. We were very happy with the service and will definitely use Williamson again!"
5,"Both our zoned units as well as a new hot water heater work GREAT!!!!! Granted it's only been a few days! But I can not speak highly enough about the customer service ""We are impressed"" YES I would highly recommend this company, and NO....we are not related ....just a great recommendation from our realtor JC."
4,"Although I have been happy with the work done under my service contract, Williamson's is consistently unresponsive when it comes to other matters. For example, I have called them on different occasions about a bathroom ceiling fan, a replacement thermostat, and some minor duct modifications. I leave a message and am promised that someone will call me back, but no one does unless I nag them for several days. I have also tried leaving a message with my service technician when he comes for his semi-annual visits. He promises to follow up, but never does."
5,The work has always been great! They have been able come out after hours to assist with our needs.
5,They did a good job. I was happy with their work. The repair of the thermostat was included within a maintenance plan with them and there was no additional charge.
4,"They did a good job and I liked them very much. They are good, but they are little expensive."
5,"INSTALLATION WENT WELL ACCORDING TO THE TENANT. THE INSTALLERS DID A VERY EFFICIENT AND CLEAN JOB. THE HOT WEATHER, WHEN IT COMES, WILL DETERMINE IF THE UNIT IS AS GOOD AS I THINK! THE ENGINEER AND I HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS UP FRONT ABOUT SIZE (THE OTHER TWO ESTIMATES WERE FOR THE NEXT SIZE UP,) BUT JOHN PAUL CONVINCED ME THE SIZE WAS RIGHT!"
4,"The service technican was on time, friendly, courteous, and knowledgable. He told us what he checked and why and what he found."
5,"Great service, wonderful technician! Couldn't be happier! The furnace is working well now and doesn't have the annoying noise that les us to call them in the first place. They replaced two parts (inducer fan and blower wheel) and did a cleaning. Manny was our tech and is a great guy, very knowledgeable and thorough. Highly recommend Williamson's!"
5,"The old wall AC unit went out in our guest house and we decided to install a mini-split system to replace it after we had done our homework. We called Williamson to do an estimate, based on their good ratings with the BBB and Angie's list and we were not disappointed! The installed price was well within the reasonable range for the unit we needed, the installers arrived on time and did a fabulous job on the installation. That same evening, the unit started to leak water (we assumed the drainage was blocked for some reason). We called their 24 hour service line and agreed we could wait until morning to have it looked at. Their guys arrived early the next morning, apologizing for the problem and fixed it quickly (yep, clogged drain line!). No problems since.... We are very happy with the unit and Williamson's! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone!"
5,They did excellent work. They were very punctual. They were very communicative in regard to what to do and in fixing some of the issues that I had. They were very thorough.
5,"Our house was built in 1963. The new $70 / 70 cfm fan didn't quite fit in the space of the old fan, but the technician was able to modify the space and adapt the duct work. The new fan works just fine, but is a bit noisy. I don't remember if Williamson's offered us the option of a quieter fan. We would have been willing to spend more if one were available."
5,"We have used them for a number of years, and they have always been honest. We would use them again, and we would recommend them."
5,Installed quickly and cleaned up after work. Workers were polite and courteous. Unit was installed as quoted and looked great.
4,"We first visited their office on S Alvernon Way. Then we met them again at a home improvement show. Our decision was based mostly on price. The visit to their Alvernon office was not impressive. The receptionist could not help us with our questions. The sales person was busy on a telephone call in a back room. After a few minutes, we left without being helped. As we were leaving the parking lot to merge onto a busy street, the sales person ran up beside our car and tried to wave us down. This was not safe or professional. During the home visit, we felt the technician's emphasis on replacing our complete system was slightly heavy handed."
5,THEY GO BEYOND WHAT WAS EXPECTED-EVEN CHECKED OUT MY WATER HEATER.
5,They gave me great info on my current system. They didn't try to sell me a new system even though my current one is old. I feel they were honest and straight forward with me. I will definitely work with them again in the future. They were very thorough. Both my family and I use them for all of our needs.
5,Williamson's Heating & Cooling did an all around fantastic job. We had a really big problem with our ceiling and they came out very quickly with no hassle. The high quality or their work made us very happy and we highly recommend them.
5,THE MAN THAT COMES OUT IS VERY COURTEOUS AND NICE. HE TAKES HIS TIME AND ALWAYS HAS A NICE CONVERSATION WITH ME BEFORE HE LEAVES. THEY ARE JUST A WONDERFUL COMPANY.
5,Very satisfied!
5,Excellent service
5,Obviously very well.
5,EXCELLENT. great service
5,He did a good job.
5,Great job start to finish.
5,See above.
5,Very good.
5,Very good.
1,"Johnathan Delgado (don't know who Jesse is) assured me that the company was licensed and insured and that he would email the paperwork. When asked again, he said ""I'll send them tomorrow""... As he could never provide the Condo association with the documents, he made me waste 2 weeks waiting for him to do it. SO DISRESPECTFUL!"
5,"I was very pleased. Jesse was on time, did great work. Absolutely would call him again."
5,Falero did an awesome job at fixing our sink and installing a new quality disposal. Mike was amazing to talk with and walked us through each step. I can’t say enough about these guys and their work ethic and sterling quality of their work. I would not only recommend them to anyone but I would use them again in a heartbeat!!!
1,"Vendor is not licensed as a plumber per Miami Dade BCCO database. He arrived to work in our building which requires license and insurance and chose to register as a guest not a vendor to avoid this issue. With that said, he seemed nice however he vistited unit 2 times and each time failed to fix issue. The first visit he arrived with no tools or inclination to do more then look at the unit and report it fixed (which it was not) to the property management team. My experience overall was POOR. Each time he tried to convince me the issue was resolved when it was not. It has now been 30 days and I still have no functioning shower in my unit. I would not recommend hiring this firm without a defined scope and confirmation that they are licensed and insured to do plumbing work in Miami."
5,"Highly recommend. They came same day, super friendly, fast and cleaned up after."
5,They are absolutely amazing.
5,"The quality of work was excellent. They were the best plumbing I've got. They were timely, the quality of the materials was good, nice customer service, nice guy, and excellent service."
5,Mike was great. We had an emergency and he helped us right away.
1,Went over my list with them. Was professional and indicated I would receive an estimate of cost. Never heard from again and it's been over two weeks.
4,All work was done well and efficiently.
5,"Fantastic! I would definately hire this contractor for another project. I received a fair quote and was able to discuss the details. I was able to easily schedule my visit. I received email communication to confirm the visit. The technician arrived right on time and, even though he was working outside, he wore a mask the whole time. Justin K. was clean, respectful and professional. He knew what he was doing and got the job done quickly. The final bill was less than the estimate so that made me very happy. Highly recommended!"
1,He never got back to me with an estimate. Not even after I texted him to see if was interested or not.
5,The handyman had obviously done his research and arrived with everything he needed and knew how it should be assembled as well as the local codes.
5,Showed up on time. Work completed in a timely manner.
5,Kevin our tech was very professional and personable. He was able to complete the work without issues and we are very satisfied with the job. Communication from the office was great. We knew who was showing up and when he would be here. Great experience from beginning to end.
5,"They were wonderful. they were on time, didn't mess around, and very professional. I will have them come back nest Spring and I will continue to use them. The Office Manager, he responded immediately to my emails and calls."
5,"Unbelievable! Beyond impressed with quality of service, and the technician that arrived, very punctually was very knowledgeable and polite. Being a homeowner for approximately 10 years, I have dealt with quite an assortment of contractors. Mr. Handyman has gained my trust after this experience, especially after calling multiple contractors with a state of urgency, all of whom replied they ""may be able to get someone out next week""... Mr. Handyman dispatched a tech the next day! I will not hesitate to call again, THANK YOU!!!"
5,"Eric did a phenomenal job repairing our deck and was a joy to talk to. The work he did speaks for itself, and he is obviously is skilled at what he does, but what was also great was that he offered to do additional repairs outside the initial project scope. I would definitely hire him for future deck repair and woodworking needs again."
5,"Awesome. Bill did some of the same work for me last year, so it’s nice that they try to keep staff you’re used to do the jobs needed, if possible."
5,Very well. The service was able straighten and reattach a long length of siding blown off and reattached siding tat was loosened. The serviceman arrived earlier than estimated and completed the work quickly.
5,Mr Handyman did good job considering the circumstances. My mailbox was knocked down but the ground was froze. I was provided with a sound temporary solution. Plan on using Mr Handy man for the permanent installation.
5,"The Service Technician was extremely professional and paid close attention to our needs. He advised us that the screening did not need to be replaced, but only needed to be “re-seated” in the door frame (That saved us the cost of a new screen). I would recommend Mr Handyman of Waukesha to anyone for household repair."
4,Not completed yet. Was unable to repair. Will be replacing whole unit
5,"Great! Ron Marish was polite, pleasant and completed the job quickly."
5,It went well. It has been over two weeks and no mice. David was very professional and did a good job. He cleaned up after the job was done. I would definitely hire them again.
5,I could not be more satisfied with Mr. Handyman of Waukesha! Bill came to do the evaluation and it was clear he knows home repair. He is personable and I felt I could trust him - was glad that he was assigned to come back for the repair work. I also appreciate their flexibility - Bill advanced the project to the point where I can do finish it with the painting. Jessica in the office was great with communication. I have finally found a reliable solution for home repairs I can't or don't want to do myself - I highly recommend them.
5,"Great responsiveness, got work done relatively fast. And quality was very good as well. Very positive experience."
5,"Great! They were timely, professional, and affordable."
5,It went very well! Eric Glorioso was very professional and diligent with his work. Let Eric know that he hasn’t noticed yet. He will know what I mean.
5,"very well. Our handyman, David, did a great job. He was very efficient and completed the job in a reasonable amount of time. Do thank him."
5,"EXCECEPTIONIAL! Work was done as estimated. Removed all waste, and vacuumed. Professional work. Will hire for more projects!"
5,Everything was great. Professional and polite. Fast response times. Fixed both of the issues we had. Didn’t price shop so I’m not sure if they’re competitive price wise but we were okay with what was charged.
5,"Kevin Lucht was excellent. His work was top notch. He was professional, considerate , timely and a very kind man. The coordinator Carry was great at her job ...kept me informed and answered all questions I had during the process. I would highly recommend and will be calling again!"
5,The quality of the repair was perfect! It looks now completely like it was before Amazon truck hit it; no-one even would notice a difference.
5,"Very well! They were professional, on time, and did a fabulous job! I absolutely loved the finished product and would hire them again in a second!"
5,"I was very pleased with the responsiveness of both the office and the technician, Bill. I was kept informed every step of the way and the job was completed in a timely matter and with professionalism. I never used a handyman service before and am not able to compare price and rate the cost, I know enough that I will use Waukesha Mr. Handyman again."
5,"The entire process was excellent. We highly recommend Martin at Waukesha and Milwaukee County North Handyman, Supurb."
5,It went very well and timely. Extremely satisfied and will hire again for different projects.
5,All went well. will monitor if leak has stopped and will have them return to replace drywall..
5,"It went great. The technician, Bill Andersen, did a terrific job scraping/painting the garage. He went above and beyond in numerous ways (e.g., cleaning the gutters on the garage so they look brand new, meticulous scraping, making suggestions that ended up improving the look of the garage). He also replaced the leaf guards on the gutters around our house and did some other repairs on some of the trim on the back porch. Throughout, he was an excellent communicator, showed up on time, worked hard while he was here, and cleaned up the work areas. I couldn't have asked for a more skilled or professional technician. This was our second job with Mr. Handyman of Waukesha and North Milwaukee. Will definitely use Mr. Handyman again. Also, their prices were competitive, given the high quality work that they do."
1,I rated them F because there was no follow-up to my initial inquiry.
5,Took longer than expected but good job.
4,Price I paid was more than quoted but the job was well done and of all the contractors I contacted they were the most responsive. Very up fronT with pricing and I like they send a picture of your contractor before he comes to your home. Very communicative and professional!
5,"The job was more complicated than expected due to age of pocket doors and settling of house and took more time to complete. Ralph the technician was very knowledgeable and efficient given the more complex job. He completed the work in a very professional manner and was friendly and courteous. Mr Handyman's hourly costs were somewhat higher than I expected along with an additional $70 service charge, but Ralph did an excellent job completing the work in 4.5 hours."
5,Everything went great! Don took everything into consideration when figuring out what needed to be done before starting the job. The job went faster than expected. Don did a fantastic job and I would recommend for any job needed to be done. Thanks again.
4,The carpenter had to run home to get his compressor which delayed the start and had to come back to the house after the project was done to pick up his cell phone charger that he left behind. The work itself was just fine.
5,Excellent job. Would use them again.
5,Technician was on time and work was done in a very professional manner.
5,Went well the man they sent ( Jerry) was very professional and kept the area very neat. I would ask for him again his work was outstanding
5,The work was done quickly and with precision. The repaired area is matched perfectly to the existing drywall and texture. There is no sign of the original cut out.
5,Dennis was great. Sent me a text right away and asked for photos then quoted me a very fair price. Set up a time a few days later to come out and did the initial repair and came back the next day and did all the finishing work. Very personable and professional too.
4,"slight scheduling issue other than that work man was extremely polite and work performed was satisfactory. front door seems ready for winter weather. Job involved removing door, sinking door hinges deeper and evenly, striping one side of door casing and installing a new door sweep."
2,Had an appointment scheduled and got a call and left a message on the Friday before to cancel the appointment. I had to call back to find out why and the carpenter quit and they had no one to do the work.
4,Very Poor. Didn't want the job. Slow to get back with me but honest.
5,Excellent job! Looking forward to working with Justin again on my next project. Hanging pictures on my wall.
1,wanted to be prepaid in advance via estimate--not interested
4,it went as best it could on the repair
1,"The guy called 20 min. before the appointment to cancel, by which time I had already rearranged my schedule for the day to meet with him. He made excuses about his worker calling in sick or something and when I noted that that was not my fault he copped a very rude and unprofessional attitude to the point where I simply terminated the phone call. I would NEVER spend money with these people. RUN AWAY."
1,"We hired Mr. Handyman to complete a drywall repair. We had two spots in the house that plumbers cut out for repairs. I called and was surprised that they gave me an estimate over the phone and scheduled the appt to do the work right then. I went with it because I wanted the job done and the price seemed reasonable. First off the handyman showed up to do a drywall repair and did not have any drywall or supplies. Why would you show up with nothing? He had general tools but no drywall. So the first day he spent 3-4 fours cutting the spots out. They charge over $100/hour. So four hundred dollars into the job and the job was 10% done. The next day he showed up and we ran out to get drywall and supplies and they charge extra for trip charges. The company only scheduled him for 4 hours on my job. So by the time we got the supplies he only had 2.5 hours to work on my job. We (emphasis on we - I was his help for the entire job) got drywall into one spot. No mud or tapping. So now I am into this job $800 and the job is 25%. I am so ******. I called to complain and they claimed that he spent most of the time fixing previous work. Such BS. They wanted to schedule a followup appt to finish the job. I said no thanks and I called a drywall company to fix. The handyman also did not tape anything off so there was dust everywhere. I cleaned up after everything he did because I didn't want to pay him $100/hour to vacuum. And the next day I noticed a couple outlets didnt work. I am not sure what he did. Another thing...I also helped him with the job the entire time. Placing the drywall, screwing it in, holding it up, I went to the store with him and I cut 2x2s for him with my chop saw. The only thing they did good was showed up on time. I would not recommend these guys. Hire a pro not a general handyman if you want the job done right."
2,"Pros: - Work that was finished on siding was done well. Cons: - Job was left unfinished. Workers claimed the remaining part of the wall was ""too dangerous"" to access without a lift, even though nothing about it was pointed out during quoting and even into the first days of the job. When I pointed out the unfinished part of the house, I was informed that the quote was time/materials, and I would receive a separate quote for the work that was supposed to be finished in the first place. Still waiting for that quote. - Soffit color did not match existing soffit. I was informedafter the product was installed that the color I have would have to be special order and would take time to procure. They had 2 months between our agreement and the actual work being done (due to bad weather); more than enough time to find and buy matching soffit."
5,"Mr. Handyman sent Ralph Saverine for our job. He was on time, went out of his way to be responsive to our requests and was both personable and professional. We have used the services of Mr. Handyman in the past and will certainly do so in the future as projects come up."
2,"I had a water damage on my living room drywall and it took almost 4 visits spread across 2 weeks to fix it. The quality of work was poor and they were supposed to complete the work with interior painting too. But till date, after 3 weeks of follow up, the painting work is still not completed. No response to emails...I made the mistake of paying them for the work done till date. Now they have got paid, it looks like they have conveniently decided not to respond and finish up the work"
5,Ralph was professional and did a great job.
5,"Ralph was a pleasure to work with; friendly, prompt, and trusted during the two visits."
1,"I sent a message on their website on Sept 12th. They called me on the 13th and asked if I could send some pictures, which I did. When I did not hear back I called the next day. I was told their tech had yet to look at the pictures but that he should get to it that day. After still not getting a call back that business day, I sent another message from their website. I just wanted to know if they would take the job or if I needed to look elsewhere. The next day, a Friday, and hour before they closed for the weekend, I still hadn't heard from them. I used the ""live chat"" on their website. I got the feeling it wasn't live since the response was generic. The ""guy"" I was chatting with wanted my phone number and email then abruptly ended the chat saying someone would contact me. I did get a call back, but the answer was the same...the tech still has to look at the pictures, which he will do over the weekend. To date, which is Nov 29th, I have yet to hear back. However, they have added me to their emailing advertising list, which is ironic since they never followed up in any way for the job I needed done. By the next Monday when they still had not contacted me I moved on to another company who wanted my business."
4,"They added blackjack around the seam of that - but it did nothing to stop the leaks. When I called back to get next steps - they quickly said ""no thanks"" and suggested I call a roofer. They charged quite a bit for not much service. HOWEVER, that said, they were very professional, cleaned everything up quite nicely - so I cannot complain there - they did what they were asked - but the leak persists."
5,The was performed accurately and efficiently. I would definitely use them again.
5,"The large holes were on about 30ft. high, Ralph was very knowledgeable on how to repair the damage. He did a fantastic job, I can't see where the damage was. We are very happy with the job Ralph did. We would definitely call him for any work we need done."
1,"I strongly discourage using this company. First, the handyman that quoted our job quit and a different handyman came in his place a day early. The new man did a terrible job muffing and taping. He took the entire day to get about half of a standard size living room done. When your paying by the hour that’s a big deal. The next day when he was to come back he never showed and the company could not get a hold of him. After waiting all day I went out to the store only to find that while I was gone he broke into my house to get his tools. The company had nothing to say other than an apology. I never heard from the company again for months until I was sent a letter letting me know they’re putting a lein on my house for a bill I never even saw. So for $870 I had an incomplete job that had to be fixed by JB drywall."
2,"I found other comparable services providers who would do the same services for half the price. The reason I chose to go with Mr. Handyman is because they told me they could do the electrical that the other company told me up front they couldn’t do. Their tech came out, install the microwave fine. Hung the closet doors wrong (before they were getting stuck, after he finished they just fall of the track) and removed switch plates (and didn’t replace them) for the electrical to tell us he couldn’t fix it. For this I got billed for 3.5 hours of work; for tasks that should have taken two hours and the electrical they couldn’t do. I did talk to the company and they were very eager to make it right and their second technician was able to correct what the previous tech did wrong, but came back with same outcome on the electrical. I am fine paying an electrician to fix the lights, but I shouldn’t have been billed for the time they decided they couldn’t do it and, moreover, they should not have told me they could have done the lights if they couldn’t."
5,It was an excellent experience. Dean went above and beyond in fixing the issue and was meticulous in the finishing. He also came up with a solution for some rotting wood at the base of the window/door. He also came up with a solution to the cause/source of the water problem. The end result was a night and day difference. I look forward to working with Dean in the future.
1,"If I could give this company zero stars I would. This is the worst experience that I have ever had with a contractor. I truly cannot even understand how these people are still in business. We called Mr. Handyman to have two windows installed in place of one window. We called this type of service because the existing opening would need to be changed for the two new windows to fit and I could not find a window installation company that framed openings. I was assured that their guys would handle everything. My quote was to be on Aug 1st with work to start on Aug 4th as long as I had the windows. When the confirmation call came for the estimate I was told Aug 4th hadn't been saved for us and we were moved to Aug 10th but if something was canceled they would do the job sooner. A little disappointing but understandable. On Aug 1st their guy came out and did not do an estimate but told my husband that he had until 4:00 to work and would be able to get the two windows done as well as some of the basement windows we also wanted to install. With that information my husband signed for him to start work. However he didn't have all the tools he needed to do the job so he had to borrow them from us. He was also called from the office and told he would have to leave the job by 3:00 to go to another job, but he would have the two windows in by then since we now had a big hole in our home. A little later one of the owners came out and told him he had to leave at 2:30 not caring that we had a big opening in our home. In the end their guy left, leaving a big hole in our home, a window that he ruined by cutting the nailing tabs off and taking our battery and nice drill bit that had a sleeve to hold screws. He said he would be back after 5:00 to finish the job. We had to cancel our plans for the evening. Worse than that, upon further inspection we found that most of the work that had been done was wrong or unnecessary. At $104 per hour one doesn't want to pay for these things. Plus there was about an hour talking either to his office and the owner that I didn't think we should have to pay for. When I called the office I was told they would check into the missing items, but were in no way concerned with my window or the hole in my house. I told them not to have their guy come back except to bring back the tools. He never showed up. The next day I called and was told I was lying and that nothing had been taken from our home. We were still going to be billed and that I needed to take the issue of the window up with the owner. It took 3 days to speak to him and he didn't call me. In the mean time I called the office and told them that if the items were not returned that I would get the police involved. Later that day I got a call that their guy had suddenly realized that he did have our items. She didn't know if it had anything to do with the threat of the police, but he would be returning our items. She apologized and asked if they could send someone else out. I of course said no because not only did their guy not know what he was doing but they also had very bad customer service. I spoke to her about the window, telling her that they can certainly have the window I just need to be reimbursed because I had to purchase another window which I also had to order and wait for another week for it to come in. She was very apologetic and said she would relay the information to the owner. When I finally got a hold of the owner he said that he would not be paying for the window and that his guy did know what he was doing. I told him that just because we chose to hire someone to do the work rather than do it ourselves didn't mean that we didn't know what should and shouldn't be done. At that point he no longer let me speak but instead starting belittling us for hiring someone to do a job we could do ourselves. At this point I swore at him and he hung up. When I called back he hung up again. I then called back and spoke to the other owner. She was no better than the other guy. She threatened to put a lien on our home. DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!! To recap: One window damaged (new one still on order), tools taken, room left a mess, horrible owners. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!"
5,I was signing their praises. We have really had very positive experience with them.
5,"We've had nothing bad happen from them. They always come right away, honestly, I can't say enough good about them. My son moved to Austin and I made sure he knew to check in with Mr. Handyman. They are always on time and if they aren't they always call. They're professional and seem to know what they are doing They have always been able to do what we needed them to come do. We have just always had positive experiences."
5,went according to plan and met our expectations
1,"Worst install I have ever been apart of. Was rough quoted 5 hours for 2 storms and 2 entry, came home to check on the job and the installer made it known he was leaving at 4. At the end of the day, they installed 1 door, I will admit it wasn't an average install, but it was 1 door in 6 hours. The door was so poorly installed, there was gap on the bottom of the door that I could see clearly out to the yard. There was spray foam insulation on the new doors and the house and yard were left a complete mess. Screws in the grass, GREAT for young kids and dogs, shards of wood, cardboard and ""stuff"" left everywhere. I called, and gave ample opportunity for the franchise owner to rectify this and all I got was there nearly $700 bill for a garbage install and another bill to have someone else come back to correct the garbage job Mr. Not so Handyman did the first time. Still no call from the owner. I would not EVER recommend these people to anyone. Not worth the money!"
1,They never showed up for the appointment on 4/3 and I haven't heard from them since.
5,Very well. Needed a part. Once part arrived work was completed. He listened to what I needed. Made a recommendation which saved hundreds of dollars.
2,"Well the customer service was good. Very professional, they called back right away. The contractor showed up on time, and that was it. After he left I have yet to hear back from Mr. Handy. I paid $50 for a quote that I have yet to receive. It has been a week. I was told the quote would take 1 to 2 days. Well they missed out a job and if I do not receive the quote by Saturday. I will be calling to get my money back!"
5,On time worked diligently to complete all jobs.
5,Was on time ran & got supplies needed & installed to the best of his ability.
5,Very well. Dean did what he was suppose to do.
5,Excellent! Dean is very knowledgeable about his work & has a great personality. The work was done timely & all the patch work & painting was a perfect match & blended in beautifully
4,"One of the repairs, replacing some molding on a screen door, didn't last. The ""new"" molding came out a couple of days after the repair."
3,"My wife and I had completed the footing and framing ourselves but needed a hand getting it completed before winter. I uploaded some pictures to Mr. Handyman and the two in the office (one being the owner) said it would probably take a days worth of work with 2 people. They sent out a carpenter who was able to look at the job before we started and said it was at least 2 days of work. I was ultimately ok with this as I know it's hard to see a job with pictures. When the carpenter came out, he was early, which was great because he needed to get all set up and going. I had left. When I returned they had about 48 sq ft of deck completed and all of the starting hooks installed. There was 2 guys with a 3rd working about 2 hours. By the time the day was done, they had about 100 Sq ft of deck installed and instead of taking 2 days, it was now estimated at 7 days. They charge $98 an hour for the carpenter and $63 for the 2nd hand plus about $87 for a trip charge. This project, if I had them finish it, would cost me nearly $10,000! I got another quote from a guy that does Trex decks in the range of $1800. The carpenter for Mr. Handyman did superb work. He was very meticulous and what he did complete looked great. He claimed that the joists were 12"" apart and there was a lot of shimming that needed to be done. That was the reason for the time put in and the length of time it would take. Not sure why this was detected earlier? The second day that was initially scheduled could not be done until 11/07. I cancelled the second day and plan to hire someone else to complete it."
1,They came to give me an estimate and never heard from them again. Horrible experience.
5,They were prompt and did good work. A little on the expensive side at 90/hr not including materials.
2,Called a couple times and phone just rings; no answering machine either. Quite odd.
5,"This is our third time using this handyman company and all three times it has gone well. While they probably aren't the cheapest around, all three times they have been prompt, professional and got the job done well. Mike the technician did have a bear of a time soldering in the new faucet in a really awkward part of the basement ceiling (hence, the main reason I was not about to attempt this), but did a thorough job. He had to order a couple of parts for the Pella screen door and the shower door which we bought at Home Depot looks fantastic now that it is installed in the master bathroom. I would hire them again."
5,Everything all went well. Jason did a great job and was nice to my family! He kept me in the loop as far as when he would be at the house and would always keep me updated. I am very satisfied with everything!
5,Services performed were excellent. Technician was very friendly and knowledgeable and we would have them back for future projects.
5,"This was the easiest process I have booked in a long time they were on time and did not drag the process out,very happy with the job."
5,"This was our first time using Mr.Handyman and it was a great experience. The technician was punctual, professional and efficient. We will be using Mr. Handyman again for any repair projects I need done around my home."
5,"A very nice job, and great to get all of those things done that have been ""hangin"""
5,Excellent. He did the work professionally and on time
2,"Mike was punctual for our appointment July 28. He was pleasant and seemed knowledgeable. We have a number of small unfinished projects we would like to get done, along with a larger project in the kitchen to replace the counters and do some cabinet work as well as a couple of outdoor tasks involving the eavestrough and minor siding repairs. I had been very clear with Mike that the estimate should be broken out by job, for example the exterior projects as one sum, kitchen separate, and smaller odd jobs as its own sum. When i had not received the estimate for the work within a week, I contacted the office and was told Mike had the estimate in his truck and would send it through. Nothing arrived. We had a death in the family so I did not contact the office again until yesterday, only to have them call today and ask about what work I wanted done. I explained that Mike had been here a month ago and I was still waiting for the quote. Later this afternoon I received the quote for $6400, but it was just one sum, not broken out as I requested so I have no idea how much the kitchen work is as compared to the eavestrough etc. and overall the total seemed very high to me. I wrote back and asked for the quote as I requested it a month ago, no response yet. Either way, we are going to use someone else. If getting an accurate quote is this challenging I doubt I have the patience to deal with managing them for an actual job. It's too bad - we could have been good clients as neither of us are handy and we would much rather pay for good work than try to bumble along on our own."
4,"- Work was of good quality. - Coordination between office and contractor was not good. Consequently items were not ordered in timely fashion, and project completion was stretched out. - Originally assigned contractor did not show up for first appointment. Waited for close to an hour. Replacement contractor was punctual and did a good job. - They provide a nice service and I would use them again. Things work better when you communicate directly with the contractor versus going through their central office."
1,"I needed a handyman to make improvement to a few items on a house we were selling. The original employee that came to the house severely underestimate the time that it would take to complete the job. While at the job site, he wasted a lot of time, lied on him time card, and did not show up prepared for the job. He took apart the windows and then left to go get parts. He was gone for 4 hours. when he came back to the house, it started to rain, so he duct taped plastic around the windows and left. He charged us for 10 hours of work at nearly $100 dollars an hour!! I contacted the office with my complaints and gave them written statements about what had taken place. They notified me that I was not the only person to have this type of issue and the employee was let go. they said they would honor the price that was originally quoted, but it took over a month for them to get someone back out to the house. In the mean time, we are trying to show our house for sale with big ugly bags on our windows. Need less to say, we didn't get any offers during that time. Once the second employee came out the finish the work, he was very fast, but at the expense of some sloppy workmanship. I would not recommend Mr. Handyman to anyone I know."
5,"Upon the first visit everything went as expected, the guy came out on time, removed the casing, used a moisture meter to verify where the water was and even provided some tips on how to dry out the casing, treat for potential mold and repaint the casing. I opted to do the painting to save some money. After a few days the office called to schedule the return trip to put everything together which was really nice as it saved me on having to call in for an appointment. On the return trip I did run into a snag where the first appointment of the day was running late so I received a call from the scheduler to let me know he would be an hour late. I waited an extra 30 minutes past the revised arrival time but Mike never showed up. I called back and received the answering service which was not very helpful. Now 2 hours late I called back at which point the answering service said they would get the message to the scheduler but I never received a call back that day. The next day I called and received the scheduler at which point she had Mike out later that day. Overall I was impressed with Mike's knowledge and attention to detail on making sure everything was taken down and put back to look like it never happened. I would be nice if in the future if the service man can't make it out you would get proper notification so you are not waiting around all day. I would use them again for the items around the house which require more skill than I possess or am comfortable doing myself."
1,"Here is my response to each of his points: At that time all gutters were cleaned and all downspouts were working properly : How can you confirm? It was December 15th and there was no rain at the point of time gutters were supposedly clean, Again the technician cleaned the gutter but did not clean the debris at the elbow joints. We have cleaned his gutters before and he always waits to the last minute to get them cleaned: This is classic example of lame excuse. Did you ever mention late when I called you? If you think you cannot serve me in a professional manner rather than sending a lousy technician and do not stand up for your doing later. Signed the work order stating everything was good and to charge his credit card : My wife signed it and she also mentioned me the technician was done in 20 minutes ( and i was charged for 2 hours). As I hired them before , I let it go by with some kind of trust and reliability. I admit I made a mistake and should have notified them about the time. On Dec. 24th we were at (removed member name) house to fix the extension to the gutters to keep the water away from his house, nothing was said that there was a problem. 6 months go by and we get a call stating that we did a sloppy job on his gutters and downspouts. I first noticed a problem when it rained hard this May. Some water overflowed the gutters after a hard rain : Just to keep the fact straight they came to my house on Dec 15th ( I called in November). I saw the problem late April and thoughts my gutters are not working properly. I request quote from 3 different gutter company.They said my gutters are fine but the joints are clogged as it was not cleaned properly before winter. 6 months go by and we get a call stating that we did a sloppy job on his gutters and downspouts : Do not exaggerate; you better know dec to april are freezing months , during warm up the freezing water can seep by the clogged elbows. The problem starts when you start to have April showers. And at that time I have noticed the problem and start to find the reason. Clogged elbow will not cause of Ice daming. I would like to make everyone happy when we do work for our customers, customer service is important to us as we are a customer service company. We do have a warranty on our work if the craftsmanship is not up to your standards or a part fails during the first year: This is the first time I have complained your cleaning. You have cleaned my gutter previous three years ( annually) at the same time (just before winter)and no problem happened . This time you did a lousy job, hence the problem occurred and I have complained . Actually I have called 3 times , every time the problem was supposedly noted by your receptionist; after the third time she said me to sent an e-mail(wasted my time). After getting no response of the e-mail, when I called back , she chatted 2 minutes with someone and said "" gutter cleaning does not have a warranty"". You took 10 days to response(""saying you will do nothng"" )starting from my first day of complaint. Is this a sign of a ""customer service company""?"
5,"It went great, Menard was very professional and did a great job. I still have a few other jobs we discussed that I will have him back to complete."
5,"This is a very old house. Consequently all the pipes & routes to them were in small, hard to get at places. The bathtub is upstairs but the clog extended to the downstairs. Mike knew everything we needed to get the job done and it took minimal replacement parts ( some new PVC ). This man was awesome! He worked hard, getting covered in black crap & he even cleaned up the mess after he was done. He explained it all as he went. We felt his price was more than fair. We could have kicked each other later because we needed him more than a few times after but could not find his contact info. to save our lives. I don't think A.L. had him posted for me to review. We couldn't even remember his name for sure - & no we were not under the influence. We do think it was 'Mike' tho'. So Mike, if you are reading this, please get more advertizing out for yourself. I'm sure that others will be impressed with your work."
5,Created the arms to replace what original installer had and correct problem with amazing quality at a fraction of the cost of replacing the window.
5,Jim arrived on time and explained in detail what was going to be performed. Very polite. Work area cleaned. Look forward to having Jim return for future work.
5,"From start to finish, a job well done!"
5,"Chad and Mike picked up the new door at Home Depot, and installed it. They had to remove the outer storm door to do this, which took about as much time to put back in as it did to install the new entry door. They did a good job and even moved some hardware from the old door frame to the new door frame that I requested. Very courteous, explained what was going on, and did the job as asked."
5,"We were on a very tight timeline to get the work done prior to closing on the sale of a house. When I called them, Debbie answered the phone and knew exactly what I was talking about and made a very close estimate on how long all of the work would take. My only complaint, and it's not specific to this job, is that I hate paying for service by the hour. I always wonder if the provider is working to the best time equation or if the work is being drug out to get another 30 minutes of pay. I don't have evidence that this happened this time, but I just wonder. I was also concerned about a $10 charge for a few pieces of tape used on the dryer vent. I'm not sure that was a just price. In the end, the work was done and done well. I can't complain about anything in regards to the quality of the work. And the responsiveness of the office staff was superb-from the first call to the electronic copy of the paid receipt and lien reciept we needed to provide the lender."
2,They came out to give an estimate for interior painting in multiple rooms but they never got back with me.
3,They were very expensive compared to other handyman services; that is why I stopped using them. I had a big issue with their professionalism. I would probably not use them in the future.
5,"It went extremely well. They were responsive. They came when they said they were going to come; right down to the second. They performed the work that was requested and they kept true to their cost estimates. The repairs have lasted for two years; just long enough which was what I needed, long enough so I could afford to replace the pergola. So I am extremely happy because I was concerned the repairs were not going to be structurally sufficient to last as long as they have and they have. They are not cheap but you get extremely good quality work. I didn’t think anybody could make that pergola last at all but they did."
5,The overall quality of the work was good. The gentleman was pleasurable. He was a nice guy. He put it in and he was talkative. Everything was fine. He did a good job. I would recommend them. He did the job and he knew what he was doing. He did it professionally and has done it very well.
5,He did an absolutely beautiful job. I really feel that the price was fair. It has held up beautifully. I have no complaints. They cleaned up beautifully.
4,"They did a good job. Theirs was the lowest bid out of the three or four people that I checked out. They had to take shutters down, paint them and put them back."
1,"We live in a mobile home, there was only a small piece of siding that got affected, they were more interested in the fence that was across the way that is owned by the owner of the mobile court. They were more interested in fixing the fence which is owned by the mobile court owner. It was probably a $250 job probably to fix it which we still don't have fixed. He didn't even write up an estimate or anything. We asked multiple people to please write up an estimate and nobody was willing to do it. My sister in the last year to do a job and she was more than happy with him but to do this little, tiny job, they were not willing to do. If you have this huge job that's worth thousands of dollars, yes, the kind that you probably have to take a bank loan out, yes. But if you have this menial task that's probably beneath them, no. They didn't even gave us an estimate, they didn't want to do it."
4,"He showed up and he was very professional. He came on time, analyzed the problem and said it will take X number of hours to do the work and he was spot on. He was very friendly and told me how he began as a handyman. It was something he wanted to do for sometime and he is good at it."
4,"It was fine. I didn't have a problem with the storm door that they fixed. It was okay. It got the job done but it wasn't really pretty. It was an old storm door. The screws had pulled out of the wood and had been repaired several times, it just wasn't working, so he was able to fabricate a metal plate to put in there and attach that, screw that in and then attach the door closer to that, so it's working, it's just not real pretty."
1,Sent an email to get a quote. Got bac to send them my phone. Sent it. After 7 days no return. After all bad reviews I am not going with them.
5,"Installation went without a hitch. Friendly, expeditious, professional service. I had been concerned about this installation because Home Depot installers claimed I ordered the wrong size door for the space and seemed to want to create barriers to getting the job done (like scheduling me weeks out). I had faith in the manufacturer (ironically a supplier of Home Depot) and in my measurements. And I really had the feeling Home Depot didn't want to do it. Mr. Handyman just came out and did the work. Fit was perfect, door looks and functions great."
2,"The work to be done at my mother's home was ""estimated"" at approximately $750/7 hours of labor which broke down to $90+ dollars per hour plus materials. The worker showed up at 8:30 a.m. as promised and finished part of the work by approximately 8:30 p.m. This did include trip to the store for some unexpected but needed parts and a side trip to another job site. He had not yet completed the faucet replacement. He was to return at 8:30 a.m. the next morning. He called me at 7:20 a.m. the next morning and said he was on his way to my mother's home but did not have the tool needed to bore holes in the tub for the new faucet. He did, however, leave the bill and despite my asking him to do so, made no contact with my mother. I attempted to reach him at 11 a.m. wondering when he would be returning to my mother's home, as she had already had to cancel a medical appointment to accommodate the second day of work. I was told he would be there after 3 p.m. By 3:30 p.m. my mother rescheduled for another day. I found it funny that I had received a customer satisfaction survey prior to the work being completed. I did contact Mr Handyman to ensure that the bill would not be paid until the work was complete. They were agreeable to that arrangement. On the new date the worker showed up on time and finished the faucet installation. He did require my mother to sign another work order/bill for the faucet work prior to the job being started. The worker failed to clean up his mess where the new floor under the water heater was installed. He also did a poor job of reinstalling the paneling and trim that covered the access to the tub water supply. I will say that the trim was not in the greatest shape to start, but there was a complete length, albeit in segments, that held the paneling in place. After his work, there are simply small, non continuous segments of trim holding the paneling in place. Her final bill was $1,165.10 and according to the worker she was not charged for his shopping time and only charged half the labor time for the faucet installation. I did read at least one review on Angie's list that Mr Handyman did not honor their estimate, but I opted to go with them anyway. Most of the work was done well, but I would not hire Mr Handyman again due to the significant difference in the estimated number of hours to complete the job vs. the actual time to complete the work resulting in an increase of over $300 in her final bill."
1,"I called to check availability and rates for a handyman to install some doors and light fixtures. The secretary took my name and number and stated that scheduling would get back to me with availability. No one ever called back. Three days after my initial call, I called back explaining that this was my second call. The secretary took my info again and list of projects to be completed. She stated I would receive an email with an estimate. I never received an email, estimate or return call. . Also they charge $96/hour along with a one time fee of $58 for travel I guess. This is expensive compared to others I have researched."
5,"I had a very good experience. They were very prompt, courteous and very nice."
5,Great - no complaints. They returned my calls and emails most importantly.... they showed up on time- they completed the work in 1 day - cleaned up afterward--Would absulutely use them again.
5,I use the same person over and over again which they are allowed to do. You can have whoever is available when you want or you can have the same person over and over. It is very easy to schedule stuff. If you need them on a specific day they are pretty good at getting me in. I paid them on hourly basis and the things I have done was for three hours and they will go on drive if they don’t have them on truck and it has happened to us once.
5,"Chad is really, really good at what he does when it comes to repairs and upgrades. There was a bunch of stuff that needed fixing at my duplex and Chad was fantastic. The best part of the service is Chad had a idea for a door closer on the door from the attached garage to the back hall that was brilliant. I had bought one of those auto closers you see on screen doors but Chad was afraid a taller person would get poked in the eye by it in the cramped quarters of the small garage. He came up with a much better solution. Using his expert carpenter skills he modified the door hinge area of the wood door and installed spring loaded door hinges. I have never seen them before but do they work great! Now when one of my tenants leaves doesn't remember to closet he door behind them, the door automatically shuts itself now. Much safer for everyone in the building and way more energy efficient in the cold winter months. Chad is the best!"
1,"On March 27, 2014 I had an appt with Joe for 8:30 am. By 9:15 I called the office, Debbie answered, she didn't apologized for the delay, just said the office was hectic and she was sending Marty, the owner, and he will be there by 10. Marty showed up closer to 10:30, saying it was a hectic morning. We went over what I wanted done, and he said he will get back to me with an estimate. April 7, I called since I had yet to received an estimate, Marty answered the phone saying, he had some family issues and will get on it. I said not a problem. April 21, I called again to inquire about my estimate, Debbie answered and said that Marty had some family issues, I said not a problem but I would like to get the estimate, she assured me she will let Marty know. April 29, I called again to inquire about the estimate, Debbie answered and said she will let Marty know and that I will receive a call the next day (april 30) either from her or Marty. April 30 - no calls from either May 1, today, I called, Marty answered, I asked if he remembered me he said yes, I asked for my estimate and also said I feel as if he didn't want my business. He got very loud and said he was working on it with all these other companies...then puts me on speaker phone. I asked him what is up with the attitude? I have been very polite thru out. I said all I want is an estimate and it has been a month, and I thought they were nice when they came out last summer to give us an estimate (at that time I really didn't know what I wanted, this time I did), as I was trying to tell him that I thought they were nice, he hung up on me. I am not sure why there was such a delay with my estimate, all the other estimates was in within 7 days. In fact the estimate from his company last summer was submitted within 7 days after meeting. I have been polite and courteous thru out this past month, when I said I feel as if he didn't want my business, I said it in jest, I absolutely didn't not expect such over the top reaction from him. Why come out if they didn't want my business? Or why not tell me after the second phone call? Marty Putz is totally unprofessional and I will not recommend this business to anyone. I do not care whatever type of awards Marty has received, his dealing with me has been unprofessional and a disgrace to those in his industry."
5,Excellent service. They came in and diagnosed it for a reasonable price.
5,They did an excellent job but they were an hour late and didn't call to tell me they were going to be late. They are also very expensive.
5,"Well now I have met all the great people at Mr. Handyman and Chris was fantastic too. So for your projects big and small I can definitely recommend this great provider. The project was more complicated than it sounds because Chris had to drill through existing tile to install the new towel bars. No tiles were chipped or nicked which was great because I didn’t have any spare tiles. Chris is an expert at what he does. Some of the towel rods were too long and he had to cut them to fit but everything turned out better than perfect. These are great people to work with as their office is easy to schedule with and the field guys are very, very dependable."
4,Good service and very professional. The costs for the services were very expense.
5,"Fast, friendly and professional describes the work done by Jerry of Mr. Handyman. When I called in to schedule the person in the office was fantastic and I knew exactly what time and day to expect Jerry. Who is a peach and was very thoughtful too and completely did the work and cleaned up so everything is as good as new. This sounds like two simple things but it was not. The first installation of the large, multi-tier towel bar was not done correctly by another vendor and when it fell off the wall it left two gaping holes. Jerry installed it securely and perfectly patched over the holes. Great job!!! I would recommend this company to anyone you has those lists of things that need to be done well as their home too."
4,"They did a fine job cleaning the gutters, but when I tried to get them back for some repeat business, they never responded. I asked him about several other things while he was here and he seemed interested, but I have given up and hired others to take care of those jobs."
3,The gentleman came out...he was very nice... made a list of the things we wanted done...provided a quote....then never showed up or called us.
5,"They were outstanding. Treated my home as if it were their own. Protected stairs, walls and furniture as they were removing items."
5,"Work was done very professionally. Technician was very courteous and polite. I asked him to observe other necessary repairs - he noted nothing other than what I had already observed and did not appear to try ""selling"" me on any unnecessary services. My only complaint was that I requested a quote for a few follow-up projects but never received that quote. Nevertheless, given the quality of the work - I will use this provider again."
5,Matched and installed a deadbolt for an exterior door. I was slightly disappointed that the deadbolt was something i could have purchased at the local DIY store but it works fine and the installation was professionally done.
5,"I've used them several times, and they work with you, they are always there when I need them and they do very good work. And if they don't do good work, they'll come back and they'll fix it, no questions asked.I've got to also buy my own materials. All the other places, they bring the material and they have a mark-up on it. There's no other place that I know of, I just had some work done by Monty and I think there were parts that had to be replaced or rebuilt and they set it up for me but I paid for it, and it saved me pretty close to 50% if not more. Because I needed some sections of the kickpanels of the door, they were scuffed up and I wanted it painted and you have to have a plastic paint for that. They called NAPA and they gave my name, told me to give them a call, said I'll pay for it, etc. They told me it would cost me $140 some odd dollars for the paint, for two cans. And I paid NAPA $25. That's the mark-up. Just for the sake of we need this part to fix it. So that's what Mr. Handyman allows me to do, I will supply the materials and you supply the labour, you know what I mean? So I am very happy with them, very happy. As a matter of fact I had a little bit of plumbing work done with them, they came in gave me an estimate. And I said ""You tell me exactly what you need, I will go and get it for you"", and they couldn't find a corresponding number for it, they said we'll go down, we'll get it for you and we won't give you the mark-up. We'll give you the receipt for it - which was nice of them. It's a franchise, but the one here, I like. The other ones, I don't know. The one I dealt with, I am extremely happy. You call them, they talk to you, they'll take all the time that you need on the phone, in front of you, whatever. I like the workmanship that they do, and if they screw up at all they come back and they fix it. They put in a basement window for me. I had other people come in, where I was going to buy it from them. They came in and were going to charge me a minimum charge of $450, and of course you get all the excuses like ""Oh we have to pay them for minimum four hours work"" etc. etc. These guys? They came in and they did it in an hour and they charged me an hour of labour and I supplied the parts."
3,"I went with this company due to what I seemed to be a fair price based on the estimate given by the installer. The actual installer and customer service representative on the phone were very easy to work with and pleasent. We missed the original install date but rescheduling was not a major issue. The installation went smoothly and the installer was very careful not to make a mess. I did experience a leak in the faucet line, which I discovered the next morning but was able to get someone out the next day to fix the leak. My concern with this project comes with the final price as compared to the original estimate. When I received the original estimate of $350, the installer said it would be a $300 project. He put a $50 cushion on the estimate in case he ran into any issues. I was not advised of any major issues with the installation or other that would have increased my bill from the original estimate. In the end, the final bill was $599 or almost double the original estimate. Per the installer, since there was such a large discrepancy, I contacted the company to discuss the final bill in light of the scheduling issues and eventual leak I had experienced. I was very flexible to work with their schedule. After the missed original installation date, I took a day off of work to meet their schedule. I received a response from the owner that I consider rude and in my opinion, unprofessional. I was accused of ""using Angie's list as a pawn to get money off for a (possitive) review,"" which in no way was my intent. I take great responsibility in writing these reviews as I rely on other customer reviews to help make my service provider decisions. I was offered a $50 off coupon and was told I would either be taken out of their system or 'highlighted in red' for future services. I asked they remove me from their ""system."" Final opinion, I am satisfied with the work performed but dissatisfied with the discrepancy between the original estimate and final bill. I should have been advised during the installation if the final bill was not going to be consistent with the estimate. Customer service was mixed."
5,"If you need a professional company to help you with repairs this is the company you should call. I cannot thank them enough for helping me out with an emergency repair I needed today due to damaged caused by one of my tenants. Mr. Handyman went out of their way to come all the way to Shorewood and fix the doors that were broken and caused a security problem. This is a fantastic provider and I know you will be happy with the service they provide to you too. This business is owend by Marty and he and his wonderful office staff found a way to help me on such short notice which I appreciated and Chad, their technician, did a fantastic job"
5,"We found them on Angie's List. They were very professional. They responded quickly and they also followed up with quotes fast as well. Overall, they were very nice people. One thing they did was instead of doing everything, they even gave us options so that we could fix it ourselves if we didn’t want to pay them to help save us money as well, so they were very accommodating. I would definitely call them again if we need to do stuff around the house."
4,"The first guy did not do a good job. However, they sent another guy to fix and complete the work."
4,The service was okay. I felt the price was a little expensive.
3,His service is fine but the cost is way too high for the work done.
5,It went well. They're always easy to reach and they can get things scheduled and done quickly. They can also buy and pickup all materials so I wasn't having to do any running around myself.
4,"Because they charged me a $50 trip charge and never disclosed that this would be part of the costs, I feel like they deceived me. I would not hire them to come back because of this."
5,"Super friendly and professional on the phone and in person. Did the jobs quickly (did not milk the hourly rate). Keep in mind that if they have to get parts or supplies that you don't provide or tell them that they'll need to bring (they do inform you of this when you set up your appointment) that the time to go get things is billable. When I have another list of stuff to get done, I will definitely call them again!"
4,"The work was done quickly and well; the only issue was the complexity due to the number of switches turning on a light. The handyman needed additional help and added some time to the project. It turned out good, but was more difficult to estimate total cost."
5,"He was within budget, on time, and very professional. The job turned out great. He was reasonably priced. I would use them again in the future."
5,"Gave accurate time estimate, arrive on time every time, help prevent future problems."
4,"Overall it went OK and the end product was fine. The workman, however, broke the vanity basin that he was installing by applying too much torque before the basin was properly set. The basin broke and flying porcelain hit the workman in the head, causing significant bleeding. Stuff happens, and the workman was apologetic (and the cut wasn't as bad as it appeared). He also indicated that he had several other mishaps in the course of his handyman work (fell in a hole while carrying a big door, acorn junk in his eye while cleaning a gutter, etc.). In any event, they readily replaced the basin within a couple of days and came and fixed and finalized everything to our satisfaction."
4,Very friendly and punctual. Worked quickly and efficiently. Very reasonably priced.
2,"I thought the trip charge was a little high. He came to do a standard plumbing job which he knew in advance. You would think he had standard plumbing supplies in his truck, but no he left again to pick up parts at a store which is 4 miles down the road and returned 1 hour later charging me 88 dollars for the trip. while doing the job he spilled glue on the floor which stained it and never came off. I would never recommend them to any one in the future."
3,"We hired Mr. Handyman to install doors in December of last year. Quality and price were good, however punctuality was not. We were the first job of the morning, and he was an hour late. The poor grades are a result of them never following up on a larger job we had called on. After a positive experience with the doors, we called for an estimate to remodel a bathroom and convert a room into a 1st floor laundry. We never received a call back, called a 2nd time, and were told they forgot. We do not recommend them since there was zero follow through."
3,"Initially we were satisfied with the work. We ran into the problems with the most recent work. They sand blasted the fireplace hearth without a hepa-filter. That left fine dust all over the house. My husband is on oxygen and the dust caused serious breathing problems. I have contacted the owner Marty and have spoken to him multiple times. He is unwilling to take responsibility and said that I should have told the worker to stop once I saw the dust. He hung up on me and refuses to talk to me further. I had to hire another company to clean the dust and that cost me $500. All Marty offered was $300 of free service from them, but I never want them in my home again."
5,"Mark came to do the estimate and he was also the one who did the job. His performance was above and beyond the call of duty as he had to work in full sun on one of the hottest days of the summer. He was on time and he completed the job in the time he thought it would take. He was extremely professional. I also spoke with Debbie in the office numerous times and she, too, was great to work with. She was on vacation when I thought we'd have the bill so I called the office and Marty, the owner, took the call. It was a pleasure to deal with him also. I can only give Mr. Handman high praise! Thanks to Angie's List for helping me to find them. We will certainly call them again when we have jobs like that to be done. Our original handyman retired so we were at a loss for a time but Mr. Handyman appeared at the right time. Thank you to Marty, Debbie and especially Mark who worked so hard in the heat!"
5,"Chris arrived about 5 minutes early and I had two lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling in the garage and wanted them replaced with ceiling fans. Chris put the ceiling fans together and installed them, he even programmed the remote control so that both ceiling fans run from the same remote. He was kind enough to look at my garage door opener that was giving me some trouble. He even shared with me a product that he uses to repair cracks in drywall. He was very nice, and took the time to look and fix a couple of smaller items. He took about 2 1/2 hours to complete the job, and cleaned up everything completely. I have called the company to have additional work completed."
5,The workman was competent and pleasant. The work was performed very promptly. The job was reasonably priced.
2,"When they came over to do the work I needed they didn’t give me the discount the flyer promised, and they charged a travel charge as well!"
5,"He completed his job in a couple days with the two areas we had agreed upon. He was up front and honest with everything and the price was what it should be, with no added charges. When he came over he noticed that our screen door gets stuck in the ""open"" position, which had been a problem since we moved in, but wasn't as high of an item on our to do list. He had an extra part for the door and fixed that in a couple minutes no extra charge. Very helpful answering questions. I would contact this company in the future and recommend their services to anyone looking for quality work done."
5,"We are in the middle of renovating our kitchen on a shoestring budget and the dated and leaking kitchen faucet had to go. The plumbing configuration under our kitchen sink is unusual, due to the ginormous garbage disposal unit that the previous owners have installed. It takes up one half of the double cabinet with the sound muffling foam thing on it. It's a beast. So after giving it a look, we knew it was time to call in someone with way more experience and the proper tools to do it right. Chris showed up right on the dot and got to work. He had to make a quick run to the hardware store since we bought the wrong supply lines. It took about an hour and 20 minutes and I am sure a lot of contortion to get it done, but he did it! He then gave me some advice on how to prep the chrome finish existing air gap cover to paint it to make it match the oil rubbed bronze finish on the faucet because the bronze finished ones are oddly expensive for some reason. Everything was left neat and tidy and it works so nice and nothing leaks anymore! We felt that while we could possibly have paid slightly less for another service, there was no vague appointment window, they are employees of the company with background checks and good ratings on Angie's List and that it was well worth the ""splurge"" and we are happy."
5,They were very good. I would rate them highly and would use them again in the future if needed.
5,"Called Mr. Handyman on 6/20/11 to have gutters cleaned. Even though we've had a lot of rain lately and thought it would be awhile before they could come out, Brad was there on 6/22/11 at 8:00 am as promised. It took him about an 1 1/2 hrs. to complete the job. Our gutters are absolutely immaculate now. The cost was a little pricey at $86.00/hr. However, due to my husband having recent surgery, we had no choice but to hire someone to do the job. The $25.00 coupon from Angie's List helped and most of all Brad did an excellent job!!"
5,"He did a great job! He worked quickly and completed the project in a timely manor. Overall, I was satisfied with his service."
5,"Overall, the experience went well. We’ve used them three times now, and they’re phenomonal. They've been very punctual, courteous, professional and performed the work in a timely manner on all three visits. They have an hourly rate, which is reasonable. They also provide Angie's List discounts. The owner of My Handyman had subcontracted out another company when we had the gutter guards installed, but the owner was there throughout the process. I'm satisfied with their services and I would highly recommend them."
5,"These guys are exceptional. They immediately discovered that the builder had never included supports, so they added the supports, replaced the rough cedar posts - on time, at budget, you cannot see that the posts were replaced. A pleasure to work with - and will do so again when needed next time."
1,"We met Marty on April 13, 2010. We went over everything we needed done. Porch railings on bottom, some window sills covered in aluminum, garage door trim and rubber seal replaced.We told him we would like it done by end of April. He said ok. We waited for some time, we called him, he called us, eventually he said after a couple of weeks, that he couldn't find railings that long and will see if he can order them. By the end of April, or so later, after coming to the house a total or 2 or 3 times to meet, measure job, he said he ordered the porch railings. We had originally set up 2 or 3 tentative times to do the job. As of today, he called and said on this Monday, he will come tomorrow, Tuesday to do the job. I said ok. Then a few hours later on Monday, he left a message and said he can't do the job and to get somebody else. He said something feels ""wrong"" and he doesn't feel he can do a good job for us! This is almost 6 weeks later after first meeting him!! I tried to call him and l left a message stating that that was horrible what he did to us and unprofessional and told him of course I will make a report on Angies List."
5,The service call went well; he was on time and very nice. Explained what he did and explained the programming of the garage door keypad. Also unstuck a ceiling fan chain.
5,"He did a fabulous job. He was here the next day after I called, in the morning with all the supplies. He was polite and very good. He was very prompt in responding to my call and finished the work on time. The price was also reasonable. He told me what he wanted to do and asked me if I wanted him to do anything else. He is very neat and tidy. He cleaned up after himself. I have recommended him to a friend of mine."
3,"They did what they came over here to do, but I remember that we were not that pleased with the work. They were responsive, but we just were not very happy."
5,"He installed 2 deadbolts, changed the locks on 3 doors and gave me keys for them. He also went to the hardware store and got me a door knob with a lock in it and he did a nice job and I was satisfied with him. He was accommodating and waited for me because I was late."
5,He did a really good job. He cleaned up everything when he was completed and was very prompt.
5,"He was very polite and did a great job of explaining what he would do and how it would be done. They gave me a 25 dollar discount for being an Angie's List member. He did a great job, overall!"
5,"He was very prompt, knowledgeable of how to work with difficulties and was tidy. He performed a high quality of service."
5,I would use him again in the future.
5,We have no complaints about him at all. He was very personal and very polite. He kept me informed about the job how explained everything. We were very satisfied.
5,They are really good. They are prompt and on time. They got the job done in one day. They are professional and I have used them before. Their prices are very fair.
4,"The first employee was very courteous and did an excellent job with the patching, texturizing and painting. Unfortunately, the caulking wasn't quite up to par. After talking to Amy at My Handyman, we made another appointment for someone else to come out to re-caulk. Another employee from My Handyman (Chip) came out about a week later and re-did the caulk at no charge. Chip did a good job, is a pleasant person and thoroughly cleaned up the area afterwards."
5,"They were efficient, knowledgeable. They had the right tools to get the job done quickly and properly."
5,"We always get Chip as our handyman. He is a perfectionist so everything is done great. A screw was bent so our bi-fold door wouldn't close. He repaired that first. When putting the oak casing around the outside edges of the doors and drawers of our outdated bathroom vanity, he mitered the corners, matched up the decorative design of the wood perfectly at the corners, took extra time to sand down the outside edges so the edges were perfectly flat, used wood filler where needed at the mitered corners. When cutting the plastic trellis material for me, he was very patient so he would get all the different sizes I wanted."
4,"I was painting the trim on my home when I found an area on the garage where the wood was rotted. I placed calls to several handymen services. My Handyman returned my call promptly. They quoted me a flat half-hourly fee & scheduled a specific date/time for the service. They also stated that if I had other jobs that I thought of that needed doing, the handyman they sent ""was mine for the day"" & I could add these jobs on. The man they sent was nice, professional, & capable of handling the job repairing the garage. I had, however, remembered that my bathtub faucet was leaking & asked him if he could fix that. He said he would look at it. As he looked at it, it became clear to me that plumbing was not one of his skills. I later found that he was somewhat new to the company & still learning. As the plumbing job was not something I originally asked for, I was OK with this. I was disappointed though, that I was charged for the time he spent looking at & determining he couldn't fix the problem."
5,I haven't had anymore problems. He was courteous and a nice guy.
4,"Job 1: The tech was professional & eager. The office called the nite before the service to verify the details & to ask if there was anything to add. We did add to & it was added to the work order & finished. Job 2: Amy at the office was very responsive to my request for an appt., since the days I was available to have this work done was very limited. She called me bk after an opening which was right for me. They arrived on time. The shower in the basement had a plugged part which would ve to be replace. Brian left to buy a replacement but discovered it would ve to be ordered. He suggested 2 options: ordering the piece & coming back abt. a wk. later, or buy a whole new valve (cost app. the same amount) & replace that day. I decided to have him resemble the shower & leave it w/out doing either, since it is not the main b/room. Brian was careful to subtract time that took him to drive & get a replacement washer for outside faucet. Work took 4 1/2 hrs at $76 per hr, which added up fast."
5,I was very happy with the quality of workmanship that was performed and promptness of arrival! He was very willing and able to take care of the miscellaneous tasks that needed attention. I will use them again.
3,"Randy was late the first day, seemed courteous enough but ill prepared to perform task. Second day was on time, was courteous, but again ill prepared for tasks and made numerous trips to his truck for tools he should have taken with him the first trip. Work completed was done well but feel the cost was out of line with the amount of work."
5,"On time, polite, communicated clearly, explained his work plan completely, gave us options when able. Had trouble reaching company after hours - we are only home in the evenings, we had to leave 3 messages before the company actually called back - this may have been an answering service issue."
5,They were very responsive at returning our call and coming out to do the work. They came back free of charge to make some adjustments to a lock that was installed. We were very satisfied with the work.
5,THEY REALLY WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO ACCOMMODATE MY NEED FOR A FAST APPOINTMENT. I WAS RELOCATING AND HAD TO GET THE WORK FINISHED IN ORDER TO LIST MY HOUSE FOR SALE. I CALLED LATE IN THE AFTERNOON AND THE HANDYMAN WAS THERE THE NEXT DAY. THE WORK WAS EXCELLENT.
5,WHAT I LIKED ABOUT HOW HE WORKED IS THAT HE WOULD MAKE CERTAIN TO HAVE ACCURACY IN PLACING THE ITEMS WHERE I WANTED THEM PLACED. WHEN HE WAS DONE HE ASKED IF I NEEDED ANYTHING ELSE DONE AND HE DID SOME ADDITIONAL CHORES FOR ME. I WAS TOLD WHAT THEIR RATES WERE BEFORE THEY STARTED AND I THOUGHT IT WAS EXPENSIVE AND I WAS GLAD TO HAVE IT DONE.
5,"MY HANDYMAN (CHIP) IS A PERFECTIONIST. WHEN I SCHEDULE HIM FOR WORK, I KNOW THE FINISHED REPAIR WORK WILL LOOK NEW. THE OWNER SOMETIMES STOPS BY TO SEE HOW THINGS ARE GOING. THE COMPANY IS VERY FOCUSED TOWARDS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION."
5,"Polite, courteous, on time, very helpful, and knowledgeable. Excellent!!"
5,"They are not real cheap and I have used them about three times now. They really know how to problem solve and all the people I have worked with have been very knowledgeable. They have a service call charge, a trip charge, cost per hour and cost of materials. If you want the quality sometimes you have to pay the price. I would hire them again. They do not make excuses and I have never had to have them come back to fix something."
5,THE HANDY MAN WAS ON-TIME AND DID AN EXCELLENT JOB REPAIRING THE DAMAGE. HE LEFT JOB SITE NEAT AND TOOK PRIDE IN HIS WORK.
3,"I TOLD HIM THAT MY SPECIFICATIONS MUST BE TO VA STANDARDS, HE SAID THAT HE GOES BY THE STATE STANDARDS. I FELT LIKE I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO ARGUE THIS POINT, I JUST WANTED AN ESTIMATE BASED ON MY SPECIFICATIONS. HE DIDN'T ITEMIZE OR GIVE ME A DRAWING OF THE ITEMS THE WAY THAT I NEEDED. HIS PRICING I FELT WAS VERY HIGH."
5,Everything went great
4,Good nice man
1,wont return my texts or calls.
1,He said he couldn’t do it.
1,They do not service 53095 area
3,The job was too big for them
5,Very nice man and I trust him.
5,It went really well!!
5,It went well.
5,"Timely, professional work."
5,"Great, prompt and efficient"
5,"VERY PROMPT IN RESPONDING; HOWEVER, THEIR PRICES WERE NEARLY DOUBLE OF THE HANDYMAN I USED."
5,"Joe did great work. Timely, neat, and pleasant. It was so great to have him around to get to the things I haven't been able to do myself. I provided all the materials, and Joe was able to install everything and make his own adjustments if necessary. Very knowledgeable and definitely worth every penny. I have already hired them on for additional work and I recommend them highly."
5,"THIS COMPANY WAS VERY PROMPT IN RESPONDING AND INSTALLING OUR NEW STORM DOORS. THE INSTALLER WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND DID AN EXEMPLARY JOB. WE WOULD HIRE THEM AGAIN, AND NO DOUBT WE WILL."
5,CHIP WAS MARVELOUS. HE WAS EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL AND I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE CARE HE TOOK KEEPING EVERYTHING CLEAN.
5,Great job by Ralph.
5,Work performed as expected.
4,I was satisfied with the service.
5,Everything went great.
5,I think they did an excellent job.
1,Very disappointed
5,It all went well.
1,Very dissatisfied.
5,It went great.
5,"Lend A Hand was excellent to work with. The team was prompt, responsive, and great communicators."
3,"Paint, move electrical outlets"
5,Excellent service! Would recommend and use again.
5,I was satisfied with their work
5,"Did a great job, timely and professional. Excellent work and design would recommend them to anyone wanting to do any type of deck work,"
5,"It went as planned and on schedule. Had two good carpenters finish an incompleted part of our house, turning it into a very nice workshop."
1,"Mr. Woodcox did estimate on August 18,2020 my property mgr. He didn’t want to deal with her; only home owner. Spoke with him on the phone said she was my sister and property mgr. and that she knew what I wanted done. I received the estimate the next day. He added painting my kitchen cabinets, I told him that they were not being done and I wasn’t paying $2,995. He made the adjustment and I paid the first installment of $3,337.66 On August 24th I met him at my property. He was showing 2 employees what was suppose to be done. Stayed the bathroom downstairs wasn’t included and claim the concrete by the steps wasn’t suppose to be done. Then he was upset because we had done the cabinets ourselves and wanted to know who and how we did it finally we moved on through the house. Got to Master-bathroom and told his employee that the shower was to be regrouped. I said no, it doesn’t need it that it needed clean. He got argumentive about the grout. I said the garage down stairs was the one. I did price that job. My property manager chimed in and said I told you what they wanted. So the bathroom that he said he would have to pull the tub and toilet and cabinet out; now only need 2 floor tile remove and repair the floor and cut the drywall out at the tub and replaced tile. So he introduce his employees and said one was doing the deck and flooring and one did the painting. And another one would do the flashing on the garage and he was going to rewrite contract. He asked how I like pressure washing job. Told him that under the deck was not cleaned nor the house that was under the deck. Had it done again. Sparkling and repairing started Monday - Friday 8-24,25,26,27,28-2020. On the 28th the 2 employees asked if they could work late to have the weekend off, sure I said. My property mgr stayed until 12:30 a.m. and they were still at it after she left. On Saturday morning came into the house being painted, well we though 99.9% of the walls had damage and runs as well as a bleed through. Several pictures later and reminding Mr. Woodcox that I stated I wanted Behr paint because it has a primer built into it. That I didn’t want Sherrington Williams. He said the house looks good, I told him not for $5,995.00 and not for 1 coat of paint. I said you and I had this discussing on the 25th when you came back out. Stated he thought that the trial patch looked good for one coat and didn’t think the bleed through was okay. One employee was painting the kitchen ceiling with no drop clothes and paint on my hardwood floor. No lights on during painting. So on Augst 31st no shows no calls nothing. Called the owner said one man the painter had a Doctor appointment and they would be out before the afternoon. At 1500 hour called again. I got a text saying busy back tomorrow. September 1, 2020, no show until after 11:00 a.m. called the owner and I ways upset. Jeff the owner said now wait a minute the one guy had flu like system and was being tested for COVID 19. Of course I’m. Rey upset. Said will know in 3 days, here we are 6 days later nothing. On the 2nd I was out picking up supplies. He called said we would be back in 90 minutes or longer, we’ll call me. Now my bathroom in the downstairs the door was shut and stuff piled in front of it so people would know not to go in, Got back door was open I went off on 2 employees that claim they didn’t go in there. These employees knew that bathroom had problem issue and the Plummer had been there working on it that morning and 3 days before that day, The toilet was setting for 24 hours to cure the sealant, but know Jeff they said went in there. On the 5th of September when went to use it, after it worked on Wednesday the 2nd, it flooded. The previous day I fired Lend A Hand Handy man. Jeff came in while my property mgr was showing the house yelling my name and wanting to know why we were mad and ripping painter tape off the walls that showed the damages of their half butt painting job. Then informed me he would put a 2nd coat on. The proceeded to ask how I like the deck. I said it would be great if something was 100% completed. I said why would you paint a bathroom that had not been gutted out yet. I asked what idiot it would tell his employee to do it. No comment from Jeff, except all he cared about was gettin a 5 STAR rating. Oh, the deck will be painted tomorrow (Friday 4th). Friday September I asked Idaho who was suppose to be finishing the deck and the one who painted the ceiling with out a drop cloth what was he doing. Picking up all the wood that had nails and screws in them that had been removed on 8-24-2020, and laid I my yard for 11 days oh and when he removed the steps in between the two decks, he didn’t tape them off for caution to other workers or my property mgr or people looking at the rental property. I asked you are painting the deck no. Why not the deck is wet due to the dew. It was 0830 he said I’m putting second coat of paint on the walls. NO, you are not. You are doing the deck, no the inside of house. NO, you are not. Okay I’ll work on smoothing out the concrete, . So I asked when are you pouring concrete. We’re not that’s what the gravel for. I said I could have bought 2 bags of rocks like I did for my backyard and lay it if I wanted gravel. Oh, it’s better this way. I walked away. Left came back 2 hours later to all the painters tape removed a walls ripped and spackled walls half butt sanding a Idaho brush painting my walls. Contacted Heff who stated “What you want me too do, I’m home sick” and hung up. Idaho said Jeff told him to do this. I fired Idaho and text Jeff Woodcox. This whole deal was $10;012.98 that I paid 1/3rd already that now I will be suing. Do not recommend."
5,It went very well. It was a challenging job due to exposed stone work on one wall and fluted antique wood paneling on other walls.
5,"they did excellant work in record time. i am very, very happy...."
2,"It took a bit of time for them to get the job together, but eventually it was done adequately. The job was performed in August of 2019, and it cost me $425. Now, 7 months later, my masonry work is coming apart and cracking in spots again. For $425 I would expect the job to last longer! I called last week and talked to J R ? and he said they would get back to me. So far NADA. If this wasn't their area of expertise they should have said so and I would have hired someone whose it was."
5,Outstanding customer service! Expectations were exceeded!
5,Being done this day
5,"Great, I highly recommend Lendahandhandyman!"
2,The floors they done were done good . but they took the paint job also not a professional look.
5,Excellent Service! I definitely will use them again.
4,Was told to have mirror cut down but if they had measured the counter top I w not have to. Cost $25 and mirror looks terrible where placed.
4,The work of the Handyman was great.
2,Workmanship was shoddy. They damaged the door they were installing. They damaged the handrail on the steps. The door still doesn’t close right.
1,"Top to bottom the worst handyman experience of my life. Simple tv hang turned into property damage and a 1 hour job took 4. It was bad. They didn’t measure or plan, just kept drilling holes (14 holes for 4 bolts) and winging it. Laughed off my concerns. Scratched my floors. I told them up front I’m a renter and to be very careful-they promised they would and then...yeah. Don’t hire these guys."
4,"good job, and I was happy with the work performance."
5,Did a excellent job
5,It took them a little while but they were very very good. I was really impressed with the tile work.
5,"It was excellent, they showed up, excellent work and cleaned up before they left."
5,Tony was prompt and friendly! Screen looks great!
5,Great! The Team at Louisville Handyman listened to requested and communicated during the projects. They really did a great job delivering quality work!
5,Every aspect of the job. Professional from start to finish.
5,"Louisville Handyman and Remodeling wont be the cheapest estimate you get but the quality and thoroughness of the work performed as well as the care given to make sure you are satisfied with the final product is what the standard for all other contractors should be. At every step of the process we were well informed ahead of time what was going to happen, what was to be expected, and when it was estimated to be finished. The work on my kitchen was amazing and thorough as the technician (Brian) took great pride in the quality of his work. I am already inquiring about work I want done in another room in my home."
1,It still has not been done. Two scheduled appointments have been delayed and now they can't find anyone to do it within a reasonable time. I shall never use Handyman Connection nor Angie's List again.
1,"Talked with owners son and he conveyed that he did not have schedule in front of him and he would call me back in 5 minutes.....NEVR heard back, bush league company!"
5,Sam was very polite and professional. He did a fantastic job. Our front door trim now looks like new! Great job!
5,"Louisville Handyman March 2018 I was very pleased with the work that Louisville Handyman performed, March 2018. I had multiple small to medium sized jobs around the house. All were challenging. I worked c Sam W, and I found him to be not only competent, but skillful. He anticipated and maneuvered past the obstacles that had frustrated me. The price was reasonable for what he did. I considered it a high quality job. My motto has always been, “Quality is rarely cheap, but it is almost always a good value”. Sam did very good quality work at a reasonable price. Sam is also courteous and friendly and easy to work with. Tony Duncan"
5,All work performed was excellent but it was pricey.
5,"From the initial call to schedule an estimate to the finished job, everything was just outstanding with this company. Eric was our estimator and came out about 2 weeks after my initial call (they are pretty booked up, which I can see why). He was on time, very professional, talked us through all of the issues we were inquiring about. After we received the estimate and scheduled the service (about a week later) we had Billy do the repairs. Super nice guy, always showed up on time, and the door looks great. I gave the pricing a ""B"" only because we had two other estimates that were lower, but in this case, you get what you pay for. I will definitely be using this company again and highly recommend to anyone."
4,"I had them out for a quote, but I didn't use them. I asked them for a bathroom and basement refinish. They seemed fine, I didn't go with them though. The customer service was fine. I found better options."
1,"The woman I spoke with over the phone was very rude and unprofessional, and their prices were outrageous."
5,I got an estimate on one day and was scheduled quickly. The technician was nice and very efficient. He got the job done quickly and neatly.
5,"Beautiful Work. The repairs looked better than the original. Louisville Handyman was great to work with. Professional, ontime, work was delivered as agreed and price was reasonable. Still hard to believe that they sent a crew on such short notice when the front door was smashed in and could not be locked."
5,Overall it was a pleasant and professional experience.
5,"Excellent contractor. All work was completed within schedule and budget. Some project creep that was my fault, not theirs, did come up, and they rolled with it perfectly. Will be hiring these guys again."
4,"The work LH provided was very high quality. A true craftsman was assigned to our job. His skills were above and beyond as was his demeanor. He showed great respect for the customer and his/her property, keen attention to detail, excellent craftsmanship. If you want a craftsman to complete your project, you would need to request this one by name. We believe the work was as good as is available for the work performed. If you have the ability to pay the higher prices LH charges and you get their most skilled craftsman, you will likely be very satisfied. The project exceeded the 'estimated' time it would take to complete by 6-8 weeks. Initially receiving a whirlpool tub that would not install in the space was partially to blame. Waited on subs created additional extension of the project. Bathroom cabinetry was also made by superior craftsmen, a sub, initial cabinetry was delivered with the wrong doors and drawers, which was remedied --- it took about 3 additional weeks for new cabinetry to be delivered. Subs damaged one brand new cabinet door minimally, LH made an aesthetic repair but didn't offer replacement. Bath tub was minimally cracked at base, not affecting operation, but still cracked, mostly likely by subs who installed. LH had the tub repaired by a manufacturer's authorized person, and extended the warranty for two years. Cost was at least 25% over bid cost; most increases were do to customer's upgrades, other additional costs were 'hidden' in billing. Sometimes an answer was provided regarding charges, other times, an acceptable answer wasn't provided. I would hire LH again, if my budget allowed."
3,"Basement was finished on time, price seemed a little high. There were some mistakes made when a new copy of the blue print was not given before the work was started. Starting to see nail marks on the ceiling and had to have them comeback and push the carpet back under the wall in some places. My job wasn't the biggest so I didn't always feel valued as a customer. I would use again but only after shopping around and seeing my options. Outside of the doors and wood work every thing else is contracted out."
5,"After reviewing work, we hired him to paint interior of house, repair deck and stain deck, build hand rails in garage and on deck. Slava also repaired front door and painted it."
5,"They did not charge me for a quote. I did not have them do they project as the price was to high, I did not want to over improve for our neighborhood. I would love to use them, I wish I could justify the expense."
5,I couldn't be more pleased with the punctuality and professionalism. Mike introduced himself and explained what he had done when he was finished.
5,technician discovered that the home builder did not properly vent the exhaust fan but he was able to properly and correctly vent the fan
5,It went great. They did a really good job. They have good price and good quality.
3,"It was not very well. They wanted $11,000 for a $4,000 job. They showed up when they were supposed to show up. They were on time."
3,The fixtures and trash drawer were installed.
5,"Sam arrived on time, and was very professional and efficient. We are very happy with the service performed and with the company. We would definitely use them again."
1,Eric told me the job would take 6-8 hours and quoted a price of around $600 and the only way it would be guaranteed is if I had ice guard used. I agreed and someone by the name of John came out. He spent two hours at my home including a 30 minute break John spent sitting in the van. A year and a half later I have water pouring into my bathroom. When I contacted Louisville Handyman I was asked to send pictures of inside and outside and then told skylights are always a problem and that I should remove it and board it up. I was told I would get a call back to figure out what needed to be done and never received a call. I eventually called a roofer and they came out fixed the leak for less money and I haven't had a problem since.
5,"The service was prompt, the quality and people were fantastic!"
5,"I had rotten wood around the garage door. Since it was outside, the company came by while I was away to look at the damage and give a quote on the work. They were willing to work with me to get it done quickly, and were on time and extremely nice when they arrived. We had two gentlemen working for ~4 hours. They acted professionally and quickly, but were still interested in talking like normal people! They even offered to bring me back lunch after their lunch break, and showed me some good fishing spots. The work was beautiful. They replaced the rotten wood and aluminum siding around the garage. They brought me out to see the area causing the issue, explain how they were going to fix it to prevent it from happening again, and had no issues with me asking questions. I even smeared some of their caulking and they were kind enough to fix it for me :) The only iffy part was that they quoted the price in a bid format instead of a quote format, I would ask for a quote next time, to ensure I pay the actual price for the work, not a price based on looking at it for a few minutes."
5,It went well. Really knew what he was talking about.
3,"Eric noticed that we had rotted wood around our doors and windows and at the space under my garage door. I?ve had several people come out and he is the only gentleman who came and did a thorough inspection and he caught it right away. I can?t begin to tell you how good he is. He noticed it along one side and started pressing on the ramping and everything and said it felt ?crunchy? below it. He went onto another and pulled it out and all below was rotted wood. He said that it was in such bad shape that he might have to jack it up; he suggested bringing a contractor out and doing a flat estimate or charging by the hour. It will be a very expensive job, but he has saved my house, and no one else caught it before this. I?ve had Champion Windows and Cunningham Garage Doors as well as Handy Pro and Bright Pest Control and none of them noticed it, even when I pointed out some of the rotted wood to HandyPro. Eric from Global Handyman has saved my house. I don?t know if it was water damage, termites or carpenter ants, but it has done a number on my home, but he caught it, and I am so pleased. He deserves accolades all around for catching something no one else has found yet. He is very professional, well-bred and well-mannered, I can?t say enough about him. He?s a good, honest, man. ----UPDATE When it came to my bill he sent the price of $700, when had the other guy come out Eric came back and said ""Great you have steel, concrete, it may not cost as much as I thought"". Once the bill came it was double. He said I hadn't answered his emails and I said I was shocked and didn't know what to say. The price was DOUBLE. How can he say it will be cheaper and then double it?"
5,The person that came out and did the estimate was absolutely accurate as far as the time and the cost. The job the gentleman did was high quality.
4,"Gutter vendor did ok job, but left after job and never allowed us time to inspect. Garage vendor was good and professional, but work done was less than what we expected. Patio vendor was very good."
3,Very responsive and on time appointment for quote. They wanted a 50 percent deposit for minor repair handyman type work. I felt uncomfortable with this way of doing business. Too much risk for the customer. If high dollar parts were involved then maybe.
2,"We were charged almost $300 to reattach a piece of trim that had come away from the brick siding near the peak of our house. Mike showed up on time and after some time trying to figure out how to do this, he made a trip to the store for supplies that he did not have on his van. He reattached the trim using some caulk, and 4 tap con screws that he had to go get from the store. For that effort we were charged almost $300. He was very personable, however, my wife and I could not believe that he didn't have the necessary items on board, and that we were charged for him to go to the store. Not only was the cost of the supplies outrageous, so was the rate we were charged. We will not be using this company again for other projects we have, and I will not be recommending them to others as well."
5,"This company is responsive, quick, and will follow up if I have any questions after the job.? Their workmanship is thorough and professional."
5,"Eric was punctual, friendly and knowledgeable. He said that Sam was the guy for the job. Sam was right on time, very professional and a nice. The wood beneath the stained glass had rotted (being quite old) and the window had slipped down a few inches leaving a gap at the top. Sam removed the old wood and the window and showed me how to clean the window of the gunk it had collected using a razor blade tool he provided. After rebuilding the window frame with new wood, he added a layer of glass to provide further insulation and to protect the stained glass. The finished product is just beautiful! I couldn't be happier. Also, he loaned me some wood glue to fix a broken chair and added a vice tool to hold the wood in place while it dried. I honestly have no idea whether the price was good or not since I've never had that type of work down before. But regardless, I would hire them again."
5,It went well. He was a little difficult to schedule with as he was so slammed with Angie's list.
5,Great to work with. Punctual. Fast work and well done. Very good at correcting my mistakes.
4,people doing the work are very good and profession. our only criticism is the price charged is very high. Louisville handyman takes a higher margin for subcontracting the work than most companies. we will not be using them again.
4,"The quality of the work was very good and on par or better than the existing construction on our 6-7 year old 4,000 s.f.+ home. We were especially pleased with the quality of work with regards to custom wood trim. The employees of Louisville Handyman were professional and communicated well regarding any problems or changes that had to be made during the work. L.H. contracted the paint and drywall work. It took a lot of effort from us to get the custom finish the way that we wanted in the bar area, and there was some drywall work done that was not completed to our satisfaction that had to be redone. I am very happy overall with the quality of the work. The price was fair, but was not cheap. You get what you pay for. However, I would say that, for the money, I should not have had to work as hard as I did to get the contracted work completed to our sastisfaction. The owner of the company was not as responsive as he could have been, forcing me to follow up on issues instead of taking care of them himself. I expected L.H. to be all over any issues and that wasn't always the case. That aspect of the project could have been better. I would still recommend the company, especially the work of the employees of L.H.. They are true craftsmen."
5,"I have used Lvl Handyman for several years and have complete confidence in their talents, workmanship, professionalism, and results."
5,Arrived as scheduled and completed repairs in two days with a high degree of professionalism. Job went smoothly. Doors work like like new and leak appears to be fixed.
5,"Louisville Handyman's office was easy to deal with, set a scheduled date & time that worked for me. John the seviceman showed up went right to work & had the job taken care of very quickly. He looked ed at other repairs that he assured me could be taked care of which I will be scheduling shortly. Good company."
5,"Joe came out to give a free estimate to screen in a porch that required two sides to be screened. His estimate was $2500 to complete this job. He was very friendly and seemed knowledgeable and came up with some good ideas on how to handle the work. However, we did not choose him to do this project due to the price. I guess as a first time home-owner I sometimes get ""sticker shock""!"
5,Joe was very particular with all details. He even had the carpet removed to prevent it from being damaged. He was careful which subcontractors he used to cut the the hole in the basement wall. Gas and water lines had to be rerouted in order to dig the hole for the egress window.
5,"They did a really good job. We had a problem with out back door where water starts standing and it rotted the wood around the door frame, they replaced it. It seems to be expensive but they did it correctly. They used the proper wood for weather. We've been very happy with their work."
5,"A frozen bathtub pipe burst during the first polar vortex. The bathroom and adjoining closet and bedroom had always been cold in the winter and hot in the summer. The plumber who fixed the pipe suggested we look into additional insulation for the wall around the pipe and in the ceiling over the tub. We called Louisville Handyman, because our pipes to the bathroom had frozen again after repair of the broken one. Craig from Louisville Handyman came out the next morning and quickly added the insulation. He had loaded everything he needed on the truck for the service run. He was friendly, professional, and efficient. We quickly felt the improvement in the temperature of the bath and adjoining rooms after the improved insulation, and are ready now for the next polar vortex round of freezing temperatures. Craig and Louisville Handyman gave us our peace of mind back, since we had taken turns throughout the day and night blowing a hairdryer over the frozen pipes to prevent another broken pipe until the insulation could be added. We will use Louisville Handyman again."
5,They did a great job and they are professional.? They called and showed up on time and did everything they said they would do.
5,"The provider, Sam, was on time and very neat. What looked like a simple cut-out turned out to be anything but simple. The original cabinetry had been custom built around the cooktop/stove leaving a non-standard space for a standard sized gas range. Sam expertly re-engineered my cabinet in order to shave the half inch necessary to make the range fit. I had thought I was going to lose the functionality of a drawer and a shelf in my cabinet but he not only spared the drawer but he expertly re-sized the shelf in my cabinet to accommodate the half inch he took off. When you look in the cabinet in question, you cannot tell he was even there. He was quick, precise, and very clean. As I learned during the time he was here, he is the one Lowes and Home Depot refer customers to who realize their new appliances don't fit when they get them home. Sam's carpentry work was amazing. I look forward to using him and Louisville Handyman for my future remodeling and handyman needs."
5,"Results were dramatic! Eric Thornton has genuine talent. I had a list of improvements I wanted for the kitchen, but Eric supplied the ""vision."" I didn't want to overspend on this small house, and he made recommendations In keeping with the budget. I wanted to use Greg Bilyeu for painting the room and cabinets and Son of a Carpenter for the flooring, and Eric made all the timing work. I was very busy with a renovation at work, so my home project was not my top priority, but Eric did not let that impact the necessary communication. We texted and messaged quite a bit, which I appreciate. I'll let the photos say the rest!"
5,Everything done to high standards. Excellent workmanship.
4,"I spoke with the owner at a home remodeling and lawn/gardening show. I had noted their presence at several shows, which to me was a good sign of the company's potential for good work. i spoke with the owner over lunch at the show and had intended to explore further the 3 projects I had in mind, bathroom remodel, kitchen remodel, and construction of a 2000 sq ft shop/garage/storage building. However, after discussion, I felt that the building construction might be beyond the scope of this contractor, so I decided to look elsewhere. It wasn't anything that the owner said or didn't say, just a feeling on my part. In the future, if I have need of a contractor for a remodeling project, I will certainly give Louisville Handyman Inc. another look."
3,They were expensive. The quality of work was okay.
3,I did not use this company.
5,Perfect experience. Reasonably priced.
2,"Called Louisville Handyman to make a small repair to a few pieces of vinyl siding that were coming. Repairs were requested due to home inspection of house pending sale. Person who came out said we also needed several other areas repaired. We said no, only fix what was noted on home inspection. Once on the ladder he said the siding in question was not installed correctly and that he would need additional parts and labor to fix. We again said no, only fix what was noted. He grudgingly complied saying without the extra parts and labor he would not guarantee the work. I called the builder, Ball Homes, and they dispute the claims made by Louisville Handyman."
5,"It went superb. I have been out of reach for about a month due to personal reasons, and he called me back to check up on me. He went above and beyond the call of duty."
4,They showed up on time and did what they said they were going to do. Their prices also stayed the same as their quote but they might have been a little high.
5,"They showed up on time and did a great job under very adverse conditions. It was wet and cold. They tore off the decking, repaired joists and put new decking back on. It took 3 days as they promised. Cleaned up very well."
4,"I called the company based on Angie's list reviews; they were evidently very busy, and so even the estimate date was several weeks in the future, but that didn't matter. The woman I talked to was very polite and precise about dates and making sure we were both on the same page. On the estimate date I received a call a little bit before the actual time, asking if he could come a little early as he was in the area. He arrived promptly, I showed him what needed to be done--a wooden awning had the spokes on one side starting to bow out in an unstable fashion, and some wooden 'soffits' on the front porch had some slats that were starting to sag; I thought the wood was rotten and would need replacing, but he said not. He said it looked like 'a couple hours' work'. He was very pleasant and professional, and the whole thing took less than ten minutes. The estimate was $390, which seemed a little high, but at the time I thought it included some painting of the areas (I found out later I had mistaken something he said, but this was not a big deal, as I can paint things myself). I agreed, and we set up a time for the following week. Again, the man who showed up (not the estimator) came on time, and was very pleasant, and as far as I know did the work competently (the awning spokes are back in line, anyway). The thing that bothered me, was that it turned out the materials for the job seemed to consists of some screws (or nails, maybe) and caulk; and it took him less than 45 minutes. In light of this the estimate seemed to me so expensive, that though I went ahead and paid it without saying anything, I eventually emailed the company to let them know what I thought, and received back a prompt reply explaining how this was a perfectly reasonable price, but offering me either a $75 refund or $150 off my next project (which I had asked them to estimate before the original one had been completed). I chose the $75 since I had decided to cancel the other project, and this brought my closing cost down to the $315.00 listed elsewhere. My dismay at the cost may have been, in part, because I have been spoiled by jobs done by my previous carpenter, who worked only for himself, and thus had I suppose fewer expenses, and could afford to charge $350 for a job that took him most of the day and used considerably more materials (Howard, why, oh why did you have to move to CO??). In summary, Louisville Handyman is a very well run company with great communication skills, responsiveness, and punctuality, but in this economy, I personally need a better hourly rate!"
4,"I think they would have done a good job but I did not go with them. The person who came was very professional. At that time I just felt that their bid was a little higher. But after having the work done, I thought that their prices were probably very realistic. I would rate them very highly as far as their promptness and professionalism based only on the quote experience I had with them."
4,Used Josh and his service for a couple of small repairs and a door installation. He did a through job on each task and did not cut corners. Had a minor issue with the finish on a door installation but he came back promptly and made corrections. I would recommend him for any small handyman work or repairs.
4,"The price was reasonable. It was a good experience. The service was good. It was really, really fast. I am pleased."
2,"It was a bad meeting, the job would have not bee done by this company. I got someone else to put in my door."
5,"I had ideas about what I wanted, and the people where eager to listen to what I wanted; when I wasn't sure which way to turn, they had lots of ideas to help me sort it all out. I worked with Angela (cabinets), Dixie (flooring) and Mike (appliances) and they were all extremely knowledgeable and patient. It took a while (about 2 months) and I hated living without a kitchen for all that time, but I understand that is pretty much standard. When it was all over, I definitely felt it was worth it."
5,He was on time. I bought all the fixtures and had them all ready so he didn't have to go to get parts. He showed up and did the work.
5,"I needed an estimate for a bathroom remodel that was already half finished, but abandoned. This company was prompt and professional, and upfront about the challenges and cost of finishing work started by others. Although I did not hire this company for this project, I felt confident about the details and price of their quote, and would seek quotes on future projects."
5,"Josh began by doing several small handyman jobs for me. He does good work, his prices are fair, and he's trust worthy. My house needed painting and he bid on that and gave me a very fair price. His crew was very neat and I'm very pleased with the whole paint job. So, when there is anything I need done at my house (whatever size job) - Josh is the man!"
5,"Their people were really professional, friendly and nice. The only thing I didn't like was when I had them first out there was that they didn't actually get up on the roof to look around. We had already been up there and I kind of told them different things that were wrong. I didn't like the idea that they didn't get up there and look for themselves. That was the only thing I didn't like. I think overall they were nice."
5,"He is wonderful, the most wonderful contractor in the world. He did more in one day than some of these others do in a whole year. They always walked out before the job was done. He is the one. I don't think I will ever need another. He is too good. I have been taken by so many other people that's why I like Angie's List."
4,"First man came out to my mom's house to find out the problem. No one got on the roof to look around he was just going by what I told him. They e-mailed out a quote, which I accepted and was asked to give half down. Then we scheduled an appointment which was very timely. The handyman that came was very pleasant and did a great job but going back to what I said about no one getting on the roof, they missed a vent pipe. But it turned out fine they sent another truck out with the extra part. i was very happy with this company and would use them again."
5,Excellent. Identified further issues and project completed on time and on estimate. Look forward to working with them again.
5,He arrived on time. Quickly assessed the need and completed the work. Also wanted him to do small plumbing job but he said he could not do it.
4,"He came out a couple of years ago to give me a quote, but I thought it was too high. I really didn't have any opinion either way, the reason I didn't choose him was because he was too high."
4,"The service sent out a man who was extremely nice and very prompt, he complimented my work but ended up having to take down most of the drywall to fix the seams. His work was excellent, however since it was only a 2' by 14' section and I had all the materials and had performed all the demo and structure build looking back I can't see why it cost $600. I've recently had some work performed by another company that involved a major gut and re-drywall and their prices were far better then this cost was. He was very prompt, he even showed up one morning when the roads had ice on them and many businesses and schools were closed. He parked his van in my driveway and when he stepped out and closed the door the van actually slid out of the driveway into the road, it was bad, but he was not only prompt he was about 15 minutes early. He seemed to really care about his work."
5,"They make you pay for a full hour of $110 before they would even come out and then it was $70 after that. They will do just about anything for that price. I had him look at remaking my banister in the house. I had this particular gentleman come in and do it another time because he is very busy with the electrical, but he does that too. I think he is really great. His is really painless service, just one person because he is good. I think they are kind of expensive. I have already used them before and will use them in the future."
5,They were great and did it in half an hour. He spoke to his boss to help reduce the price.
5,"Crew did a thorough job on the repair.?When they came for the first visit, they advised that the area had not completely dried and suggested holding off on the repair for a week to allow an remaining moisture to dry out. ?When they returned, they were able to coordinate all of the work, between drywall and painting in a narrow window of time."
5,"They were prompt, punctual, responsive and got the job done efficiently. We were very pleased with their level of professionalism and expertise."
5,They were very professional. They set up an appointment and were on time. It went well. Their estimate was pretty high. I would use them in the future.
5,"We ended up not using this company, as we did some of the work ourselves, but I was very impressed by this company's response, the professional contract and estimate, and most of all by the follow-up calls to see if we had the work completed and/or if we had any other needs or questions about the remodel work that we did."
1,The response to my request for an estimate was initially very good. I received a call and the handyman showed up on time. My son talked to him about what needed to be done. My son said the gentleman was very polite and seemed very professional. The handyman told my son that an estimate would be emailed to me in a few days. Never received an email or an estimate and never heard from him again.
3,"I was called at 1 pm and told Louisville Handyman Inc?was running late for my 12:30-1:00 appointment for an estimate of deck install/roof/door replacement. We discussed him coming later that afternoon but was unable to set a time due to his schedule and mine. This was ok and I said we can make appointment another day. Then the odd thing was he asked if I had other estimates already. We reviewed the work I needed done. He said he asked because his company would probably not be comparable to the other estimates. If I understood correctly, there was a set $635/day plus $75/hr. Being on a fixed income and the?economy, cost was of course a major factor. ?I told him that seemed very high and he said it was due to the number of workers on the job and what they were paid, gas prices and length of time on the job. I thanked him for his time and told him I would not be needing his services."
5,"Appointment made over the telephone. The service person Sam arrived on the exact time and date. He did an excellent replacement of the damaged drywall. Once compound was applied and dried. He painted the area and it is now impossible to tell where the repair was made. He cleaned up his work area, was very thorough and professional. We will continue to use this company in the future."
5,"After we agreed to the price, the planning began. From the start date, everyone involved showed up exactly when they said they would. All of the work was completed as planned. Eric was involved from the beginning to make sure all was on schedule and that there were no problems. I could call Eric at any time with questions or concerns and he was very responsive and always went out of his way to make sure that we were pleased. The main person working on our kitchen, Philip, was an excellent carpenter and very skilled at all that he did. He was pleasant to have in our home and my children loved having him there. From start to finish, they got the job done quickly and with quality. Couldn't have gone any better. I will use them again on our next project. I have a beautiful kitchen and am very pleased."
5,There were some leaking pipes. They fixed that leak and cut some holes in the wall and patch them up. The guy that came to do the job was really nice. He did a great job. The work he did looks good. I felt they were a little expensive based on another quote we got. I will consider using them in the future again.
5,Great experience. I have now used Louisville Handyman three times. I have always had prompt and professional service. Would definitely recommend this company and I will use them again.
5,"Louisville Handyman was extremely professional, yet wonderfully personable. I definitely got my money's worth! I'm a very inexperienced homeowner, had just moved to a new town, and had a long list of ""little things"" from the home inspection report. Eric Thornton, the estimator, was terrific! He helped me prioritize the home inspection items and had some really helpful suggestions. His empathy far exceeded my expectations, and he was genuinely friendly toward my dogs. After his visit, we communicated very effectively by e-mail. My projects were scheduled about a month after Eric's visit, which didn't meet my expectations, but I can easily see why their services are in demand. They pride themselves on the knowledge and experience of their professionals, so they are selective about who they add to the team--also obvious to me now. On the first morning of my two-day project, Sam arrived on time, was very thorough discussing his plan for my closet, asked plenty of questions about my needs, and also was genuinely patient meeting my barking dogs. He offered to let them out during the day, assured me he would be very careful they wouldn't get out except into their fenced yard. When I arrived home, everything was in order, and my closet was AMAZING!! I instantly realized that I had been in the presence of carpentry greatness that morning, and had hardly challenged Sam's abilities at all. When Sam returned the next morning--again promptly--we admired the closet together, he seemed pleased that it meets my needs. We discussed some projects I would complete on my own, and he made product recommendations and suggestions. Sam had warned me that I needed to try to add more tasks to my list than he could complete in a day, in order make the most of my time. I was so happy to find how many things he was able to accomplish and the attention to detail throughout. I will use them again without hesitation, and am actively working to dream-up carpentry projects for Sam!"
1,I did not appreciate the extreme price they quoted me.
5,"They were good, but, were on the expensive side. I may use their services in the future."
5,He did the work in the most cost-effective way possible. He was very good and very reasonably priced. I was expecting a much bigger deal. He came up with a good common sense and effective solution. I like his service and the way he operates. He tries to the best of his ability to give his honest opinion. He's an excellent carpenter who uses his time efficiently. I loved him. I would use him again.
5,He did an excellent job. I had no complaints. I didn't price anywhere else; I just wanted it done. He was very responsive and came at the time he said he would. He was very professional. I would absolutely use him again.
5,I have used them in the past. They are excellent. I would not hesitate to use them again. They were prompt and gave reasonable bids. They were generally able to stay within their bid amount. They do high quality work.
5,"It entailed a lot of work and it was a good quote. We just didn't use their services. Just by talking to them and having them come out to my house and give me an estimate, they were very professional. If I could have afforded the quote, I would have used them. They were too expensive. They have a really good reputation as far as I could tell from Angie's List and just from other sources around here. They were very responsive. Actually, the president of the company came out and did the quote for me. I was very impressed with what I saw of them. They had 3 of their top guys come out and examine my house and what I was asking to have done. They called back to me within 3 days of being at my house. If I could afford them, I would use them in the future."
3,"Came and gave an estimate,arrived when stated. I mailed a deposit in and set appointment time for work. Handyman arrived without supplies he needed. Went shopping for light and stucco mix, got wrong kind of mix. Installed light and went to get correct mix. When he got back it was to late and was starting to rain. Said he would be back. Ten days or more later after some calls to see where he was, he returned and finished the job. His work was good, I asked how much I owed and he gave me a total and I wrote a check for balance due. A month later I received a bill for almost double what I had written the check for, when I called the office and spoke to Brian he said he would check with the person who did the work and find out about the check I had written that had not been deposited. Two weeks later I call again as I hadn't heard from Brian. He stated he had paperwork in front of him and would get right back with me. Four days later Brian called and wanted me to stop payment on check and issue a new one which I immediately did. I ask Brian why the handyman had not came with supplies he needed and why he wanted to charge me for hours he used while shopping. Estimate said for time and supplies. I thought that was for time worked. The check was for original total the handyman had said was balance in full. I think their estimate needs to clarify the terms more clearly. They give a bid for a specific job and should come prepared to do that job."
5,Excellent - Dan looked at all of the jobs and determined which tools to bring in from the truck and the order in which to do all jobs. He was very efficient and professional.
5,"Very well. When I called I was promptly given an estimate (in this case time and materials) and a date for the work to be performed. The repairman showed up promptly, worked quickly and efficiently. He did a very high quality job and cleaned up when he was done."
1,No one ever came
5,The handyman did an excellent job
5,Can not tell it was ever there!
5,It went very well
3,Didn't use
5,Great as always!
5,Great.
3,"The bookshelves were built to our satisfaction. The work was of very good quality. The craftsmen were polite and efficient. Unfortunately, they spilled oil based paint in our driveway at the beginning of the job. The stain was finally removed after 6 months had elapsed. They attempted to clean it with chemical methods, all of which failed (and killed some new sod to boot). Eventually, a light sand blast was required to remove the stain. I feel the response to this was extremely poor. It should have been addressed immediately after the spill, not 6 months later (and a few calls to prod them to do it)."
5,"THEY WERE PROMPT, POLITE AND EASY TO WORK WITH. THEY DID A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS WHILE THEY WERE THERE AND THEY WORKED VERY QUICKLY IN THE TIME THAT THEY WERE THERE."
2,I can't recommend them.
4,They were good.
3,NO est. no work
5,They performed the work just fine.
5,great
5,"He is reliable, he is prompt. He is cooperative to add a project that originally not on the list. He is fun to work with. He is flexible and agreeable. His talent are diverse. His pricing reasonable. I would recommend him without hesitation.."
5,Great! Very professional and prompt.
4,"Could have been better, really should not have taken 3 days."
5,"Mr. Hammond and his employee were very professional. We had them install siding and windows and then had them do some drywall and trim work. We were on vacation, Mr. Hammond’s work exceeded our expectations, work and cleanup were done when we got home. Would definitely hire him again!"
1,call did not go through. Can’t say I would hire again never got to hire them the first time. I called Takl.
3,"Declined to do concrete work, though they replied to my request promptly."
5,Excellent job will definitely use them again
5,"Mr. Hammond and his assistant stayed focused on their work but were friendly and helpful. They cleaned up after their work and left the house as they found it, but better. I will definitely call on Mr. Hammond for my next jobs."
1,"Took several days to call me, then came out to give me a quote but said he would have to email it to me in the next few days. I’ve never had anyone not be able to give me a quote on the spot. So, seven days later I got the quote & I asked when he would be available to do the work. He was supposed to get back to me in a few days again to schedule something for the next week. Well, it’s now the end of the next week & I haven’t heard a thing from him. I’ve already hired someone else for the job who called me back, gave me a quote & came to do the work all within two days."
5,"Mr. Hammond and his assistant did a first-rate job and accommodated my time constraints. I thought their price was reasonable. The man whom I engaged through Angie's list FIRST was a total disappointment. He tied up the first day calling at the end of the day. He was just there to look over the job. He said he would get in touch with me the next day...his schedule had become to busy to do the work that day. He only called me and came after it was dark the next day, and he did not seem to know how to do the work. He said that an address plaque had to be secured by a bolt that screwed in at two directions. He did not center of finish drilling holes. He was foul-mouth and crude. HE said that he would come the next day, day 3. He acted like I could drop classes and other obligations for him to come ""sometime"" the next day. I told him that if he could not get me into his schedule after two days, I did not want to wait more time to have the whole thing be bumped into a third day. He struck me as being unscrupulous, and he talked about bigger jobs being his main consideration because they paid more. He was proposing that I set aside a whole third day for him to maybe be able to be there to do the work. I said that the arrangement did not suit me. He said that I needed to get someone else to do the work then and hung up on me. I would NEVER call that man to do work for me. He was unreliable, crude, temperamentally unsuited to deal with people, and appeared to be unscrupulous. Hanging up on someone who does not let the small job be bumped into a third day was a deal breaker. The guy's name was ""Larry"" and he worked at the Jeff Davis company in southern Indiana, which is in southern Indiana. Please do not name me as the person who gave him a bad report. I found the man scary. I would give the man low marks in honesty, reliability, sociability, and know-how. I would never call his company again. The review below is for David Hammond, the second man whom I called through Angie's list, did a fine job installing my address plaque and remounting a garage rack. I was very accommodating and did a fine job. I would call for him again."
5,David was very responsive and did a great job. I wouldn't hesitate to contact him in the future for larger jobs.
5,"The work was done well, on time, professionally at a reasonable cost."
5,"Always stayed in contact with us, always on time and very flexible which was very important."
5,Great they were in and out and knew exactly what to do.
5,They finished quickly and worked to make sure it was turning out how I envisioned.
5,"David is a honest and hard-working guy. He and a helper did a really good job repairing some rotten trim and soffit, painting the exterior wood and installed a new backdoor I purchased at home Depot. The price was more than fair and there were no surprises even though the door required more work than expected. He always notified me prior to arriving which was nice. I appreciate David's work and will not hesitate to use him again."
5,He and his helper were very friendly and considerate. they arrived on time and got to work immediately. They were knowledgeable and exacting. We thought it was charming that David whistled while he was working. He knows his stuff. Was a perfectly perfect experience and I couldn't be happier. We will definitely use him again!!
5,"Good quality work, prompt, cleaned up after. Friendly and courteous. In one instance where mortar was dripped onto the sidewalk, he came back with a wire brush to clean it up."
5,Great! Excellent work restoring our barn and building the large compost bins. Very pleasant to work with and work is xcellent.
5,Great. This was a very small job and they were willing to do it. The price was right for the work required.
5,"I have used We Can Do LLC on several projects over the past few years. To date, I have never been disappointed with quality nor cost of their services. They are polite, reliable, pay attention to details, and pick up after themselves. I would recommend them without any reservations."
5,"Dave arrived on time and began working on the deck. Not only did he tear down the deck but also took all the debris with him. Job took about 4.5 hours. He did discover that additional wood would be needed for the job due to more extensive wood rot. He secured the additional supplies and still finished the job on time as promised. The quoted price did go up however even with the increase, the price was within our range and the finished product was well constructed."
5,"I found David Hammond's services (We Can Do. LLC) through Angie's List and was very happy with his professionalism and the quality of the work he completed for us. Not only was he personable, upon first contacting him he happened to be available for an onsite estimate the same day! Our front entryway job included drywalling 3 adjacent surfaces, retexturing the replaced section of ceiling, reframing the door with trim, and replacing the entryway ceiling light fixture. The project was tidy and completed over two consecutive days, despite the drying time for multiple layers of mudding and sanding. In addition, the end cost matched the initial estimate and though I always got an answering machine when I called, David consistently replied within the hour (usually within 30 min!) and communication remained good. He came to do the job on the days he said he would, and even called on those mornings ahead of arrival. Mr. Hammond is definitely at the top of our list for our next home repair/improvement job."
5,David returned call with a prompt estimate. When we decided to go with him he was prompt and reliable. He did the work just as he promised and there were zero surprises. David performed the type of work you expect from a professional but rarely get these days.
5,"We have used several handyman services in the past. David Hammond is the best of the group. He is prompt, professional and pleasant. Quietly gets the job done, and the price is reasonable and fair. It is a good feeling to know we have David Hammond when we need a handyman and then some."
5,"David was very responsive and after the initial estimate, he was able to make it out about two weeks later. The job lasted 3 days and everything was completed as I had expected. This is the second time I've used him and I will call again if I need anything else done."
2,Called twice and never got called back. Suck.
5,"Punctual, performed work exactly as agreed, nice guys. Doors look great!"
5,"The owner, David Hammond, provided a detailed, written estimate of the job. After the estimate was accepted, we agreed on a time to complete the work. David met the schedule. He called before his employee and he arrived. Both worked steadily to complete the job and were skilled, knowledgeable and respectful. My husband and I were very happy with the work and would recommend We Can Do to anyone."
5,"This was new construction. a bedroom for our 3 year old grand daughter. They worked quickly, were fun to have around and never minded that they were under the watchful eye of a three year old supervisor. Great work, careful cleanup."
5,David was pleasant to work with and did an excellent job on screening in our patio.
5,They came out the day that I called. They contacted me one hour before they arrived. Cleaned up there mess and gave me an approximate coat before they arrived. I will definitely contact this company again.
5,"This was the second time we used Mr. Hammond's services. The first time, was to remodle an old bathroom that required a replacement bathtub and shower, sink, new tile floor, exhaust fan, and replastering. Our experience this time around with Mr. Hammond was no less favorable than the first one. He proved himself to be a courteous and experienced professional in his line of work. On a couple of occasions he made suggestions that saved us time or money toward the completion of the project. He also took pains to keep the dust level in the house to a minimum. Should we need the services of a skilled handyman in the future Mr. Hammond would be the first person I would call. On both occasions he did a great job for us."
5,"David of We Can Do, LLC arrived precisely on-time. Appeared he had all the materials and tools needed from his previous estimate. David carefully moved our clothes dryer closer to the exterior vent, and he explained why - a shorter vent pipe means less lint thereby reducing fire hazard. He removed the old 15-foot long vent (aluminized plastic) and replaced it with corrugated aluminum - greatly improving the fire resistance. Surprisingly he also used brackets instead of spring clamps to attach the new vent pipe to the dryer and the exhaust. He explained this should solve the problem we had with the old vent piping disconnecting from the dryer due to vibrations. Overall, most pleased. We Can Do is slightly more expensive than other handyman services. However, David listened to my concerns and needs, solved each one, and explained what and why he did something."
3,"They returned a phone call to came to give an estimate promptly. The job was $650 which sounded a bit high, but I just wanted it done, and quickly so I could get everything put back together! They told me that they thought they would be able to do the work the next week. Then it turned out to be the next week, then the next. I had to call them to find out about the rescheduling. In the meantime, they did give me the name of another person to do some other work around my house that I needed done that they didn't do. I called him and he came and gave me estimates, one them was for some of the same work and it was literally 1/2 the price--to remove and replace 6 planks on my front porch/deck. ""We Can Do"" gave me an estimate of $120, the other guy $60. The new guy did that job fortunately, but drywall wasn't his area. Anyway, the drywall was done, done promptly, and done well when they came. They were there each day (it had to dry after each day) first thing in the morning and called each time to say they were on their way. Again, their drywall was good. However, in the iiving room, they pulled up the carpet tack strip to take out (or replace, I'm not sure which) the drywall, and when they did it left big holes/divits in the concrete. When we called them about it, they did come back to repair them, but they said that they thought that when the carpeting people came to lay the carpeting back down they figured that they would fix it! It was fixed, but David didn't seem happy about making the trip to do so. I'm not too picky, I mean, I am, it's my house, but the little details can impress, or unimpress me. Like, they didn't fix the concrete, they didn't put outlet covers back on the walls, I had to touch up paint where they didn't when they put the trim back up in the living room."
4,"He Informed me that he doesn't do work in the Old Louisville Area. This is neither a positive or negative review, just informational."
5,"The work went well, he was on time, neat & everything was done professionally. He brought the necessary trim & matching paint & the garage doors look great. The faucet works well, no drips or leaks. I'm going to be using his service in the future."
5,Everything they did was very good.
1,"We chose We Can Do depending on the Angie's List ratings. I called and left a message several days passed and he called and left a message. I called and left a message several days passed and he called and left a message. I called to respond and could not leave a message. I understand being busy. However, not even responding to a possible client or making an attempt is not professional."
4,Response took a few days. I wanted laminate flooring installed. They don't do this type of work.
5,They were very dependable. They did high quality work. Scheduling was kind of slow but they would call and check in with me.
5,Scheduled appt. and repairs were done quickly and for the price agreed to
5,"He was there when he said he would be. He finished when he said he would, The job was great, he cleaned up after himself and was very forthright with his communications. a great experience, (which does not happen often) I WILL use him again"
5,"I found We Can Do through Angie's Big Deal, and things have turned out really great. Following a call to explain and arrange a time, David came and estimated how long it would take (the deal was for two man hours of work), and then has come back to patch the walls. David is still going to come back one more time and sand and then paint the repairs being made, but has been waiting on me to get the matching paint. He's been very friendly, yet professional, and excellent with communication. That is something that often frustrates me with contractors - not communicating when they can arrive or following up with return calls. That hasn't been a problem at all with We Can Do. Pending the outcome of the sanding and painting, I am definitely planning to use them again when I need handy-man work done. I especially also appreciate that he's been willing to make three separate trips - the 2nd one was to cut out small pieces of the walls that had been repaired so I could get an accurate paint match) for the discounted work."
5,"David was prompt to show when he came for the estimate. Initially we were just going to do the deck doors (the seal was broken on one) but I also got an estimate to enclose the bottom of the deck. He had an excellent idea, to use T-111 wood siding, which we will stain in the spring....a much cheaper alternative that hadn't occurred to us. He and his partner/helper did a great job, were kind and considerate the entire time, cleaned up after themselves, and could not have been any better. We intend to call David again when we need a handyman. I highly recommend him!"
5,"David was good about calling when he was on his way to my house. Since he is only about 15 minutes away, this was very helpful. He was careful about covering the surrounding areas with drop cloths before beginning the sanding. Tthe job was finished to my complete satisfaction. David was professional, attentive to details, and pleasant to work with. He made friends with my dog who was always happy to see him arrive. I will definitely call upon him in the future."
5,"Great experience, will use 'We Can Do' again.Prompt and courteous. Always called before coming over. Very satisfied."
5,"He and his helper were very friendly and did a good job. I had a problem about a week later with one of the door knobs and he came out the same day and fixed it immediately. Then I had a question about something else and called him and he responded the same day, answered my question and was very professional"
5,Our bathroom upstairs had a leaking and stained the ceiling over the kitchen area. So we wanted to have it repainted. I have tried a few handymen and neither wanted to take the job because it was a small job and required multiple trips. Dave gladly accepted it and did a wonderful job.
4,David was reliable and good to work with. We went back and forth on ideas about completing the project and he was patient through the process and did a good job
5,All services were performed in a timely manner with very professional personnel. David was very fast and courteous as was his helper. I will use them again as things arise in the house.
5,"Fantastic. Easy to schedule. Easy to work with. Nice job done, reasonable rates. Will gladly work with again!"
5,"David did a fantastic job - we couldn't be more pleased. He was hardworking and honest in his dealings. He did a lot of work in a short period of time, I'm certain we would have paid twice as much with a different provider. He took on our BIG problems with ease and make them look like small issues. We will definitely use him again as we need other things done around the house."
5,David called soon after I purchased the coupon from Angie's List and scheduled a time to come and see what I needed done. He took all the measurements for purchasing and installing a banister to my basement on a concrete wall. He returned about a week later and completed the work in about 45 minutes. I am beyond pleased with the job he did.
5,"The contractor was very efficient in attempting to fix the existing fixture. After determining that we would need a replacement, we were able to find the same model at Home Depot. Mr. Hammond responded very quickly in another trip to our home to install the new fixture.We were very pleased with the response time and the effort made to fix the old fixture."
5,"I have several rental properties and David has done several projects for me. He does a very good job , is always professional. I know I can trust him to get the job doe correctly the first time without any follow up on my part."
5,He came and was only here for 1 hr. He got everything I needed and is going to come back for the other hour at a later date. I really didn't even have to make an appointment with him; he was just that prompt.
4,We are remodeling a house that we just purchased. I called We Can Do and spoke with David Hammond the owner. We set up a time for a review for an estimate. Well it was about a week later than he said but he came a provided us with an estimate. After getting a few other estimates we decided to use We Can Do. I had removed most of the wallpaper in the dining room but the drywall was damaged and the wallpaper backing remained. The first layers of the drywall came off in places. In the kitchen we removed a back splash and it also made a mess of the drywall. Same problems in 2 baths. David showed up when he said he would and he and his helper worked a very long day that first day. While they were working I pointed a few other small drywall problems and asked if they would repair them and move an electrical wire for a light in the pantry. They fixed them all. They covered the hardwood floors and cleaned up each day. They came back 2 more days and finished the work. The drywall is ready for priming. Even after the extra work they did for me the final bill came in under estimate. I would highly recommend them and will use them again if I need any drywall work done. I've got a basement that needs to be finished.
1,It took too long to set an appointment to come out and obtain an estimate. Finally set an appointment and they came out to look at my house. They told me they would have the estimate to me the following Monday but it has now been over a week and a half since they came out and still no estimate.
5,David was on time and very professional. He worked hard and did very nice work. He left the work sight clean. I received good value for the money spent. I will hire them in the future and I highly recommend them to anyone. I have him on speed dial.
2,Wanted some dywall repaired. Left email and phone messages never recived a call back
5,"It went very well--I was so pleased to get this long-standing nuisance taken care of in such a short time. I estimate he was here a bit less than an hour. He charged by the job, not the hour. He also gave me some tips on keeping the downspouts clear. (See "" Description of Services Performed"" for details)"
5,See above - very professional & courteous!
5,David was extremely easy to work with. He returned my calls promptly. Estimate to completion of job was about two weeks. It was a relief to have someone call us back in a timely manner and complete the work. We are very pleased with the work he did for us. He is very honest and up front about cost and materials needed. He even took it upon himself to fix our slamming storm door on his way out. We've already requested him to repair a small crack in one of our exterior columns on the front porch. We will definitely use him again! Could not be happier!
5,David did a wonderful job. He arrived when he said he would and was even a day early in one case. He did the work even when we were at work. He is a really nice and dependable individual. We will definitely use him in the future!
5,"It went great. He went over the detailed list, identifying those jobs he could do; those he could not; and those he would handle differently. The jobs he could not do he recommended someone. and he provided a realistic, informative discussion of the materials needed which I purchased which saves the consumer a lot of money. He clearly has an eye toward saving consumer money and works diligently while he was here. The time he was running late, he called promptly. Very pleasant to work with. Will definitely use for all handymen type jobs. Highly recommend for all those jobs you have been putting off."
5,They have excellent service and they did good work. They are very good company to work with. I have had no problems whatsoever.
5,"He was very professional, showed up on time every morning and even came back out earlier the next day to make sure the job was completed before the painters got here.. Did a great job with out charging an arm and a leg and I will deffinatley be calling him again in the future.. I have saved his number in my phone. Bypass all other handymen and go straight for him, he is worth it and you wont regret it... I just hope he is available when i need him next time."
5,I hesitate to say how good he is for fear of him getting too busy! But he deserves the highest praise! He knows what he is doing and doesn't waste any time getting his jobs done. I'm making a list!
5,"Put together furniture, fixed light switch, put nails in brick..... they were quick and did exactly like i wanted"
5,Contacted David by email using the link on Angie's list. He got back with me within a couple of days and was able to do the work according to our schedule.
5,"We Can Do was very easy to work with. Very pleasant, punctual and easy to get in touch with. He quoted a very reasonable price for the work and actually charged less when it was done. Cleaned up work space. Finished work very quickly even though he had to come out 2 more times to finish sanding the drywall. Excellent work. You can't tell that there wherever 5 large holes in the wall. Will definitely call him again and recommend him to my friends and family."
5,"Main handyman arrived on time with his father-in-law who originally started the business and provided assistance as necessary. Both men were professional, capable, and very personable. They stayed on task, answered all questions, and were able to trouble-shoot problems as they arose. I feel confident that they would let me know if a job required another person with different skills than they have."
5,he does great work but best of all he explains every thing and the ways we might want something done and how much each way would cost so that we can choose. We will certainly have him do work for us in the near future. My husband would like a little lower cost.
5,I had a great experience using WeCanDo handyman service and would highly recommend it to others.
5,Great job.
5,"fine, did a good job"
5,Perfectly well
5,Guy was a perfectionist!
4,They don't level mobile homes
5,"Amazing people, Amazing Work!"
5,He was very detailed and did a great job. I have used before.
4,"gThey came out very promptly after I called, and did a professional and thorough job. They installed the closet rack, mounting the hooks more securely so it won't rip out of the drywall again. The same day they installed 2 bath lights and fixed the drywall around it. A few days later they came back and cut beveled wood boards to replace my old ones on my front porch posts. They primed and painted the boards also to match."
5,"Mr. Hammond proved to be a skilled, contentious, and reliable worker. He was pleasant to work with and maintained a tidy work site. Iwould not hesitate to use his services again."
1,I called them and they could not help me out until a week or so after.
5,"They came out and looked at the job. The guy who came out, said it will take 2-3 hours to complete the job. He gave me an estimate of around $35 an hour, which was less than what another guy charged me. He was pleasant. He talked about some other things. He gave me some advice on future jobs I was thinking about. When I called him, he said he would here the next day, and he was here the next day. He was on time."
5,He did it very quickly the day we requested the service. A quality job was done swiftly and we will definitely use this company's services again!
5,"We couldn't be more pleased. David was professional, kept us informed on schedule and had wonderful ideas. He completed everything on time and under budget and finished before Derby despite the April monsoons. He also managed to complete extensive plaster repairs and painting and kitchen cabinet painting and hardware replacement at our daughter's house during the same time period. We will definitely be using him again."
5,went great. Wil be using him again in the very near furture. painting this time
5,"Outstanding work. We had to cancel the first appointment due to weather, but he promptly rescheduled and arrived on time for the second appointment. My husband was home when the door was hung. My husband was pleased and that says a lot. We will use this company in the future."
5,"These guys did a great job! They were very quick to arrive and quote the job and the total installation did not take more than a few days to give the mud appropriate drying time. We noticed some small imperfections in a couple areas and they took care of it without issue, they also insulated the outer wall at no extra charge."
5,"Ordinarily I am too busy to ""report"" on service providers. But Mr. Hammond is a gem. Last job he did for me was to remove a lighting fixture, and install two in its place at opposite ends of a room, one of which was a fan. He had to got out and get some extra parts and crawl into my attic to get the job done. Great job. Done in a day. When Mr. Hammond did his first job for me, I offered to pay part of the job up front. He refused to take my money and told me right away that he never accepted any payment until he was sure his customer was completely satisfied. You can't go wrong hiring this man."
5,"Two other contractors were lined up to do the job, but were repeat ""no call, no shows"". I called ""We Can Do LLC"" and Mr. Hammond showed up at my door a few hours later, gave me a reasonable quote and started the job right there. My ceiling did not require a huge drywall job (like the other two led me to believe), but merely a plaster repair. He came everyday to apply coats of plaster and then sanded it down on the fourth day. It's a perfect job, I'm so pleased. It's rare to find a company that answers their own phone and keeps their promises these days, thanks ""We Can Do LLC""! I'll be a lifelong customer!"
5,They did a very good job. The job was done quickly by one worker and he completed the job within 2 hours. He did show up on time and cleaned up after he was done with the job. They came and started the project within two days of the time when I called them.
5,"I thought he was great. He came when he said he would. He did what he said he would do. We were very pleased with him. He called us back, a lot of times people in that industry don't do that. He showed up on time. He cleaned up all the mess. I was very happy with him."
5,Excellent service and work!
5,Great service.
5,Great.
5,see review.
5,Went great. Very thorough
5,A very good experience.
5,"Joshua was incredible! He did a perfect job and did it quickly! With Covid being a worry, I asked him to do the work in my garage which is not heated. I felt terrible about that but he was very agreeable and polite. I could not have asked for a better person to do the job. I would definitely hire him again. He gets a A+ from me!"
5,Wonderful. I would hire them again.
5,We are very pleased with this work. Repair of walls looks great. The pattern in the plaster was matched and painted. Joshua was on time and got right to work. He cleaned up after the job was complete.
5,"Joshua showed up on time and was ready to go with all the materials. He estimated it would take 2-3 hours, and it ended up taking about that time. He is professional with a great attitude and I would hire him again. This was a fairly small project which many won't do because it's not worth it, but Joshua understands one small project usually leads to more in the future. He has good business sense, and did a great job on this project."
5,"Had couple drywall repairs that he took care of for me. Very punctual, reasonable & did a Great Job!!"
5,"Josh and his nephew did a an outstanding job, very professional in his work. 5 +stars"
1,"first time the call did not go through. Next time, I left a message, no one ever called back"
5,"Joshua has been great. He has proven to be a tremendous help in preparing our house in the Highlands for our move this spring. So far he has installed a kitchen sink, water filtration system, garbage disposal, new lighting inside and outside, oak handrails and newel posts for the main stairs, a new 15' countertop in the laundry area, new front storm door, replaced a dimmer switch while re-anchoring a track lighting fixture and he has fortified the long closet rod in an upstairs closet. Joshua is prompt, efficient and extremely professional. As a sole proprietor of his business, his name goes on every project and he is very mindful of that fact. I will absolutely continue using Joshua's services and highly recommend him to anyone who needs a well-rounded handyman. Having gotten several quotes before beginning work, I determined Joshua's pricing to be very reasonable."
5,Very well. I was very impressed with his attitude and professionalism
5,"The first handyman I contacted through Angie's list did NOT get the job done because he had ""bigger irons in the fire,"" and I do not think he knew what he was doing. He kept bumping me off of his agenda over a period of three days. I would NEVER call him again The second one was considerate, gave me a reasonable price, fixed my two projects, and was prompt. Both jobs were done to my satisfaction as promised within an hour for a reasonable price. He had an assistant. This second handyman is one the husband of the childhood friend of my daughter. This second workman, who did a first-rate job, is a very capable and polite man that I would be glad to ask to do jobs for me in the future. His name is David Hammond."
5,Ceiling looks great and he did a great job! Will definitely hire again!
4,"The work was performed on schedule and correctly. However, the drywall finish wasn't great. The mesh was still showing when complete. Thankfully the drywall contractor I had come in afterwards fixed the work."
5,"I'm providing an A grade rating to this company because of their honesty. I loved that this company was transparent and did not commit just to get our business and then make us wait like so many others do. I spoke to Josh and he was honest at providing his availability. Even though we didn't to do business with him due to our immediate needs, we will certainly keep him in mind if ever needed."
5,It went well. The work was done quickly and the craftsmanship is good.
5,"Handyman was timely, professional and helpful."
5,"When we finally connected, he came over and did an excellent job!"
5,It went well. He was the lower of two bids for the above work.
5,He as always did a great job for a fair price. Highly recommended!
5,The work turned out excellent and I would hire again and/or recommend him to other people. The workman ship was excellent and complete.
5,"Joshua is very good at what he does! I LOVE my new bathroom. I had intended to just get needed repairs done in my bathroom, but Joshua suggested some tweaks that would update the entire room. He was willing to do whatever I wanted, but I went with his suggestions and could not be more thrilled!! And he stayed within my budget. Excellent work, professional, kept work space clean, responded quickly to any concerns, and price was very reasonable."
5,"Very good, extremely nice and did a great job of repairing walls and ceiling. Even went to Home Depot to get caulk to complete time I had paid for."
5,"Joshua was great. Arrived early, did the job needed, was very friendly and answered all my questions."
2,"After much back and forth as to time to do the work, a schedule was finally agreed upon. I took off work and waited and waited. . . finally I emailed him and his response was that he had not put my name in the time slot. Not a word yet about rescheduling or refunding coupon cost."
5,"Very well so smooth on dry wall, I only have to sand a little bit -very professional."
5,Joshua performed the work above and beyond my expectations. He explained what he was going to do and gave me great information for what to look for to determine if we have a larger issue than just old grout.
5,"Great! Prompt, courteous, excellent work."
4,"Punctual, very nice. I may have been expecting too much on the crack in my ceiling."
5,Josh came on time and did an excellent job. He explained everything he did and told me hints to try to prevent it from happening again. I will definitely use Josh again on future projects.
5,I am very pleased with the quality of work and would recommend this professional.
5,I was very impressed. We will be hiring him again.
5,"He began work as agreed and on-time. Was careful in repairing what could be repaired and what had to be replaced. Nice job ""distressing"" replacement wood to match original. Came in at the lower end of the quoted range."
5,Excellent! He even bought the new hinges.
5,"Sun porch is approximately 10 x 12. We supplied paint and primer. Joshua recommended a high-quality primer since we were painting an interior vinyl surface. He also supplied some extra primer. Joshua took extra care with caulking brad holes, taping baseboard and metal hardware, and any other imperfections. Nice job! Repaired a 90-year old ""Russwin"" door latch. Removed a bathroom door to completely rehab, which included removing and polishing all metal hardware. Very well done! Work done on-time and, as always, at a fair and reasonable price."
5,"He is excellent and very fast and neat. He does excellent work as well. In fact, I damaged someone elses house and I had him go and fix that too at a reasonable rate. I would highly recommend him."
5,"Josh did a great job. He arrived on time, worked fast, and did a great job. He is highly qualified and is a very nice guy, too. We have already asked him to do more work for us."
5,"While in the midst of a renovation, we ran into a problem requiring installation of a new ceiling electrical box. Joshua has done multiple jobs for us in the past so I called and asked if he could come the next day so we wouldn't have to delay our project. Joshua was gracious to come even though he had a full day's work scheduled. He's a gentleman and always does a good job."
2,"His caulking job was fine, good work. BUT: IT took him 3 1/2 hours to caulk 4 tubs??? He double charged me because he said the Angies List deal was only for one residence and I had him do two apartments. What's the difference: $75/hr for two hrs. of caulking in either kitchen or bathroom is what I bought. So I paid him additional $75 - culda got it done with Lowe's or Home Depot guys for $50. But: The guy knocked a tile off the wall, left it barely hanging. Going to have to have that fixed now, thanks to him. And then, somehow he pulled the handle on the handheld shower head, dropped it, and broke it. So, now because of him I have to go out and buy another showerhead extension and pay another handyman to put it on for me. So,,,,,no, don't think it went very well for me at all. Mr. Roark, however, made out like a bandit."
5,"If you are a perfectionist (or are married to a perfectionist like I am), Josh is your guy. He replaced four exterior doors and three screen doors in our circa 1964 house with new doors from Home Depot. They look great and fit perfectly. He is a great communicator, and does an outstanding job for a very reasonable price!"
2,"The drywall repair was okay, but wasn't smooth, and they suggested it was ready to be repainted, which is just silly. In the process of the ceiling drywall repairs, the moulding at the top of one of my cabinets was broken off, and repaired by haphazardly nailing it back in place (crooked) and bending the nails onto the wood (?!). I would have preferred that they admit they did not have the proper tools, and wait to do the repair. We contacted them to come back and repair it, which they did. It was done, but still not very well. it's obvious not flush with the rest of the cabinet, but it seems to be permanently warped or something. He showed up in a bad mood-- pretty much just coming in and leaving without saying anything, obviously upset that he had to come back. Even though the repair was mediocre, we were ready to be done with them."
4,It was alright. We were not able to come a convenient appointment until the March or so. He offered to come but we were unable to make our appointments work. He showed up when we agreed to and kind of cleaned up after himself. The price good. I don't think that he did as good a job on finishing it up especially with the spackle. I think that could have been done a little bit better.
5,Josh did a terrific job! He arrived in time was friendly and professional. Kept the area clean. Would definitely recommend Josh and would hire again.
5,Joshua provided the estimate on a prior visit and showed up the day he scheduled the repair even though it was raining all day. He completed the work in a day and agreed to add on some extra indoor repairs I requested. He and his coworker were professional and thoughtful.
5,It went fine. It was just the cost of the Deal. They were a little late but they called and let me know so it was fine. I would recommend them. They had a lot done in the 2 hours.
5,"At first we had some difficulty (punctuality, professionalism, thoroughness of the job) as we were working with a gentleman who was an employee for the owner, Joshua. For reasons unknown to me this employee no longer works for Joshua. After I began working directly with Joshua things got immediately better. He and his assistant were very professional, polite and flexible. They were eager to work with me to make things right and exceeded my expectations. I have since scheduled more work to be performed."
5,"Joshua ran a little late the morning of the appointment, but was good about informing me (I was off all day, so it wasn't any kind of problem). Quality work and looks good. The job was bigger than the 2-hours purchased through Angie's List, but he's coming back late this week to finish the job."
4,"The worker arrived on time the first day, and worked on caulking the shower/tub. I also asked him to return to repair some drywall in various areas of the house at an additional price. He was late the second time he came, and did not call to let me know. The caulking work was not acceptable, and I asked him to re-do it. Even the re-do was not acceptable to me. The drywall repair was good. The young man and his co-worker were pleasant, but I don't feel that the caulking work was professional quality. I wanted it to look better than if my husband had done it, and it didn't. Very disappointed, but at least it didn't cost very much."
3,New grout did not match the remaining old grout - the new was much darker. I declined the provider's offer of a re-do.
5,Joshua Roark came write on time. He promptly started working. I had a leak over the granite tile above the kitchen counter. The kitchen counter tile had lifted. Joshua carefully removed the tile without a scratch and placed it back in place He also fixed the drywall above the kitchen counter. My wife came home and was very pleased with the work performed. I would highly recommend him.
1,We received no reply form our inquiry to this provider.
5,"The handyman and his helper arrived on time, worked quickly and finished the task in the two-hour time-frame that I had already paid for. I was very pleased with the finished product, and with how knowledgeable this handyman was of historic properties. He shared some very good ideas with me about how to proceed with the bathroom renovation."
5,Came on time and completed job I less than 3 hours. My wife had been wanting this done but I just couldn't get around to it. Happy I called them. Excellent job
5,"Very professional, friendly, cost-efficient work. Would use again."
5,"Josh and Jamal were on time, extremely courteous and professional. They completed the work requested in a timely manner and cleaned the area accordingly. I would definitely recommend them and would hire them again."
5,Old caulk was removed (which was a challenge). New caulking was completed. It made a tremendous difference in the appearance in the areas that were done. Everyone was professional. I would definitely use them again!
5,Professional Handyman arrived on time and went right to work. I showed him some other projects I wanted done and he prepared an estimate. His rates are reasonable and his work is professional.
5,Josh was prompt and professional. He called ahead to let me know when he was coming. He was on time and completed the work exactly as promised and cleaned up the bathroom following the job. Great service.
5,It worked out really well. They did a very professional job and it was exactly what we needed. I rated it highly.
5,It worked out really well. There were no extra fees. They did a very professional job. It was exactly what we needed.
5,"Josh and his assistant were great! I was very impressed with him as he gave me a time to meet him at my house and he was actually there a minute early. He gave me a fair estimate and I accepted. He showed up at my house (again on time) and completed the work when he said he would and it looks great! My wife was hesitant about strangers being in our home when we weren't there, but Josh is very trustworthy and no need to worry if you can't be there while he is working. He does general handyman jobs and I will use him again should the need arise."
5,"Excellent. They arrived exactly on time, completed the work efficiently and well. I will definitely use them again."
5,"These guys were great. I had really only planned to have the shower caulk removed and recaulked and that would have been worth the $75 to me but they told me that wouldn't take 2 hours so we added 2 tubs caulking to the original job. Since they were here and I had another thing I needed fixed, I asked if fixing a pocket door would be something they would be able to do. Of course they could and they fixed it at a very reasonable cost. They were very punctual, polite, professional and I asked for their card as I plan to hire them again whenever I need a handyman. Highly recommend! Thanks Josh and Jamal!"
5,"Meticulous removal of old caulking with new razor blade for each room. Perfect new caulking, deep and neat. A true craftsman and artist with a caulking gun. A great value with so much accomplished for such a reasonable cost. I will never try caulking myself again."
5,Joshua arrived on time and went right to work. My husband and I were amazed at how quickly and expertly he performed the job. This is an older home and neither the floor or walls are level or square. Joshua efficiently made adjustments to make the cabinets and countertops work without additional expense to us. I had ideas that weren't the easiest to execute but Joshua completed the task without complaint and even politely suggested ways to improve on my ideas. He did a superb job installing a dishwasher where one didn't exist. He is a quality craftsman as well as a very fine person. He was extremely easy to work with and I will always use Joshua for repairs. His pricing is very reasonable when you consider how quickly he performs the work. We really appreciate his attention to detail and his commitment to pleasing his client. I've already scheduled Joshua for another job!
5,"Joshua is great! He looked over the work I needed done and quietly made great suggestions that saved me money. He was there working efficiently. Yes, there are times when he needs to pick up his sons because his wife is finishing school, but I was flexible and trusted him to let himself in and out of the house as needed. I was out of town and impressed that he had everything done so quickly and well. When he saw an area outside that he missed mortaring, he was back the next day and fixed it without me even knowing it. He's a hard worker, and he came up with some creative solutions for an area that was really hard to work with. Hire him! I'm going to write him write now and ask him to come do some other tasks. So wait a day or two, please, before contacting him."
4,"They arrived on time but did not have all their tools on the truck. Left to go back and get what was needed then realized that the ""snake"" had been broken on a previous job and not repaired. I marked down a little on professionalism because they should have checked all their tools and supplies before heading out for the day, The work they did was fine and I would use them again. I think the experience was a learning one for them on checking their equipment!"
5,"Joshua came with his partner John and completed the work they hung 22 pieces of art and 2 mirrors and moved three huge carpets and put three different carpets in their place. They were great as long has he's willing to do handyman services we'll use him and or his team. They completed the job taking care to hang art with wall mollies to ensure their safety all the while being very very professional I have just remodeled our home and have had electricians, plumbers and painters who would be wise to take a page from Joshua's book in professionalism. LOOK NO FURTHER you've found your next handyman...just call Joshua."
5,"also calked under my kitchen cabinets. Like I said, he has a good eye for detail. I would use him again."
5,Joshua and his helper quickly moved through my projects. They were very professional. I'm having them back to install screen door when it's delivered.
5,"They did a great job! There were no additional fees associated with the Big Deal, not even for materials. The guy who comes out is easily available and does what we ask him to do. He is professional at caulking bathrooms and his pricing is great on Angie's List."
5,"He was efficient, nice, attentive. He did what I asked and it was quality work"
5,"I was allowed to use the coupon that I had purchased from Angie's list, but due to the problem, the cost was higher. Both men were professional, courteous, and respectful. The job was explained as what needed to be done and its cost. Only wish that I had was that they had provided and installed a new tub drain mesh as well."
5,Everything turned out well. They showed on time and did the work as promised.
4,"It was good. He was a pleasant guy, did good work, and did a good job. He looked good and cleaned up. He took him about six hours and probably paid him an extra thirty dollars."
5,The drain cleaning ran into a hiccup with piping what was in poor condition. The gentleman took extra time and repaired the piping.
5,Joshua was very nice to work with. He arrived promptly and went right to work on cleaning grout around our two tubs. He applied caulking where needed. He also applied a layer of silicon seal to finish the project. We are very pleased with the finished project. He also did a nice job cleaning up when he was finished.
5,"We just wanted to hire someone who is dependable and is good at what they do. After looking at his reviews, we decided to hire him. When we contacted him, he was able to come out on a Saturday to provide an estimate. He ended up being able to complete the work on the same day. It turned out really good and it looked much better after he completed the work. We are going to be calling him to install the bathroom fan in the future."
4,Josh arrived exactly as scheduled and went right to work. He was a very pleasant young man and a pleasure to have in our home. He regrouted the shower and caulked where needed. He also caulked around the tub and vanities without being asked.
4,"he did a pretty good job, looked clean and fresh after he was finished"
4,"Service came out and previewed work requested and approved list. The work done was done well, except for the ceiling fan. Fan was out of balance and needed to be cleaned and balanced. He worked on the fan for a long time, 3 hours, and no fan remote will not work. Spent a lot to time trying to fix a problem that wasn't the issue. He didn't carry a lot of tools, and had to make trips to get them. He even requested that we pay for renting a taller ladder to facilitate the work. The eight hours work was scheduled over the course of a month, because of the limited time he was available, only week days from mid morning until 3 PM due to child care issues. I will say again, the work was good, just long and drawn out."
5,The service provided by Professional Handyman worked out fine. I got the job done. He was quick and communication was fine.
5,He was on time. He did his work. He was clean. He gave us a good estimate. There were no complaints about it. Everything was fine.
3,"Our kitchen sink is badly clogged and they tried to unclog it but broke a pipe. The sink is still clogged, but I think that's mostly because our plumbing system is badly designed, so there's more work to do no matter what. My landlord was not happy with the results but I thought the father and son who came and fixed it were very nice people. If anything I think their customer service was great."
5,"Joshua did an excellent job. In fact, Joshua also put in a back yard fence, re routed gutters, and cleaned brick mortar for me. Also, when there were problems with the air conditioning, Joshua went right over, checked out and repaired the problems. I have been so pleased with Joshua's vast knowledge in diagnosing and repairing the home maintenance problems I've had this year. I would use Joshua in the future and both recommend and endorse his work quality. Mary P"
5,"He was very fast, friendly and efficient. He also seemed quite knowledgeable about all types of projects."
4,"I have used this provider three times. The first time, Josh did the work himself and he did a beautiful job. The bathroom looked great and the clean-up was immaculate. The next two times he had a new worker in training. The quality of the work was not the same, and I had to cleanup the excess grout myself. I would use this company again if Josh was doing the work himsef."
3,"Part of the work was of pretty good quality and part not very satisfactory. Not very good on cleanup or do over where needed. If I needed tile work done again other than the very simplest thing, I would hire a tile specialist. This contractor in my opinion is not in that category. A Very nice person, but the work as a whole was somewhat disappointing."
3,"It was okay. It was supposed to be 8 hours worth of work. It was not a direct 8 hours of service; they are allowed to bring somebody and split the time up. I didn't see that part. He came and said someone else was coming. I just thought it was a friend and didn't know that it was on my dollar, which it was. He did 4 hours and the other guy did 4 hours. I probably wouldn't use them again."
5,"He responded quickly to my emails and showed up on time. He came out to take a look at the job and then came back on 2 different dates to finish the work. This was great because the coupon we bought just covered 4 hours of grouting and caulking and he actually needed some thin set for the tiles in addition to grout and caulk. We are very pleased with the work. Turns out he's a widely talented ""handyman"" so we'll be able to work with him again in the future on other odd jobs. He cleaned up after himself and only charged us extra for the special caulk he had to purchase to match our tile grout (which was a great attention to detail)."
5,The person who came out was very prompt and very efficient. The price was appropriate. I'd absolutely hire him again.
4,I was looking to replace the missing and damage wood siding on my chimney. They seemed knowledgeable and they were professional. But I decided to use a local company instead. I will not use them in the future.
5,The repairman fixed all broken grout and cleaned shower. He did not however have the sealant and asked me if I had already purchased it. I was not aware that I had to. Other than that he did a great job. Will probably use him again.
2,"The handyman from Professional Handyman was on crutches when he got here and he brought somebody with him to take up the slack and I had purchased 2 hours of professional handyman service and I wanted a ceiling fan to be hung and it required me making a scaffold in the room so that they could work. He told me that it would take longer than 2 hours to hang the fan and he said he would charge an extra USD 200 to get the fan up and that was estimating an extra couple hours. The fan got put up and the handyman wasn't here very much and he was gone to different places, but the guy who was helping him did most of the work. I really had questions as to whether it took as long as they did to hang the fan and I went ahead and paid the extra USD 200 and he said that he thought that it was more than that because he had 2 guys on the job and I told him that he was himself on crutches but he paid me by the man hour, so I ended up paying much more to get the job finished. I just wasn't happy, I don't think I good deal.He made the comment that he had 2 men on the job, but one man was not capable of doing anything. I told the guy to use his best conscience and let that be his guide. He offered to give me a USD 20 refund and I thought that was a slap in the face. They took so long to do it and I have hung fans in the ceilings and it doesn't take 4-5 hours to do it. It was a vaulted ceiling and he knew that before he got it, he should have passed the job over instead of doing that."
5,Joshua meant with me to get the floor loaded And bought back to the house and unloaded It as we'll.. Great guy!!
1,"I contacted the company via email with information about what work I needed done. I did not receive a all for two weeks. Once contacted I was informed the owner was in the hospital and that the caller worked with him and could assist in providing an estimate for the work I needed. The caller informed me they were busy since the owner was in the hospital but could come out the following week. I requested him to call me the next week to confirm his Saturday appt. he called Friday to let me know he could come that day but would be able to come Saturday. He never showed up, never called to cancel or reschedule."
3,"I called provider before scheduling the work to describe the job and make sure he was equipped and able to do what we needed. The job was described to the provider as cutting and installing tiles around the base of bathroom vanities. It would require cutting so the tile would fit around the corner base of each vanity. He said he would be able to do what was required and had experience so I scheduled the job. After arriving, I showed him the three vanities, the four corners of the vanities (two tiles on one vanity and one tile on each of the other two vanities) for which tile was to be cut and placed. He suggested just putting grout under the cabinet instead of tile because he thought no one would be able to see it. I repeated that we wanted the tile to be cut to fit around the cabinet base and that you could see underneath when sitting in the bathroom. When he finished three of the four tiles, he said he thought he was done. I checked and saw that he had left one area undone, so I gave him the tile and he started again. When he cut the tile, he said it didn't break where he wanted it to because it was brittle. He asked again if he could just grout under the cabinet. I called the owner and he affirmed that the tile was to be cut around the cabinet, rather than just a straight cut and grout. The tile was the only one we had, so it was too late to do an L cut that would fit around the cabinet, so he just cut another small piece from the scrap tile and installed it under the cabinet instead of just grout. I said, though not the best, it was better than just grout. I discovered then that the other 3 had been just grouted under the cabinets instead of cutting the tile as he had been told. But then his 4 hours were up and he had another job, so it was too late to do it right. He mentioned as he was leaving, that he usually only did ""repair work which didn't justify him having the saw for detail work."" I wish he'd told me that and been honest with me before we scheduled the job, and told me he couldn't do the required work. I feel the provider was not honest in representing what he could do, both before we scheduled and during the install. We are now stuck with the only tile we had being destroyed for any repair work we'd like to have done to remove, repair wall, cut and install tile like we requested. We were very unhappy and will not use again or give a good reference."
5,Project completed in a short time. No problems.
5,"Great! They completed the work in a timely manner. Grouting & caulking the entire tub area. They also recaulked around my sink. I would recommend this Co. to anyone who needs grouting, caulking, etc. They did an excellent job for a fair price."
5,Great! I'm very happy with the finished product!
5,"Worked very carefully - it took him a few days to complete the work, but it was beautiful when finished!"
5,Everything he does is good and he is a good finish carpenter.
5,He did a fantastic job.
5,JOB WENT WELL
5,Fantastic!
1,Handyman never returned my call !
1,No one ever even responded
5,Went great
3,Too expensive. $150.00 per sill.
5,Extremely well
1,They never called me back
5,"Josh arrived on time. Performed his duties in a very timely manner, cleaned up and was gone."
1,I called on 10/4/12 to arrange for roof repair. The guy stated he would be here at 7:30 am on 10/5/12. NEVER SHOWED . He called approximately 1 hour after his stated arrival time wanting to come in the sfternoon. I had already called someone else to do the repair due to rain forcast for afternoon.
1,"I don't think they were professional at all because they didn't write me anything out, that is what bothered me and when I questioned his prices and I ask him if he could please write me something out he went to the store and sent me pictures of the parts and prices. I thought that was ridicules and they he changed his prices. He said he way under quoted me but he still was pretty low so I was going to have him do the work and then he emailed me back and said he would not be able to do the work. He said he had way underbid me and he wouldn't be able to come to my house and give me a quote. I thought all of that was unprofessional. To me somebody should write you out an estimate that says this is what I am going to do and these are the prices. To tell somebody you are going to do the work and then the day before back out. I just would never recommend them. They were punctual but they were not professional. I was very shocked because I thought they were on Angie's List because they were very good and professional."
5,He was meticulous in his work and clean up. He will be back to perform other services for us.
5,"He arrived around 8:00 AM armed with all his tools and even a tarp to throw on the floor to contain the mess from the removal of old grout, soap scum and mildew from our shower. He worked steadily until the job was done about 3:00 PM. When he left the shower shined like a jewel so I was very pleased with trying my first service through Angie's List. He was extremely professional and caring about his work! I am going to keep his name and contact information in my iPhone so I can give his contact information to my friends and family."
5,He did great. He always tries to save me money without cutting corners.
5,"Fantastic value! Went above and beyond for our bathroom -- including removing our shower doors for extra thorough cleaning and remounting them after the job was done. Clean, polite, diligent and considerate. Well done."
5,Overall this job went off without a hitch. No major snags and he took care of the minor ones.
5,He showed up on time and completed his work quickly and professionally. He cleaned up after himself and asked me to approve the work before he left. I was very pleased with his work and would contact him again for handyman types of work.
5,"Arrived on time, friendly, and efficient."
5,"Did a great job. Came out as promised. Dug deep to remove all signs of mold. Replaced grout and came back a few days later to caulk because grout hadn't dried yet. I appreciated that he didn't just caulk and I'd never have known. I had paid him for 3 hours and he had some time left and offer to replace caulk and grout around my tube. Again, I that wasn't part of our deal but I sure appreciated it."
5,"We originally bought 4 hrs of tile, grout and caulk work from one of Angies list specials. However, when Joshua came to do the work it was discovered that we had extensive water damage behind one wall in the tub area. Found out there was water condensation doing the damage from improper installation of drywall from a previous job). He replaced the drywall with durock (a sheet of concrete) replaced tile, grout and caulk. He spent 4 days here making sure the job was done properly. There was a day he was unable to arrive as scheduled but called us to let us know of his delay and the delay wasn't that bad. We are very pleased with Joshua's work and are planning on using him in the future"
5,"Joshua was here when he said he would be, did the work in a professional manner; and when he finished prior to the four hour time frame to which we had committed, he offered to hang a towel rack which had fallen down in the area in which he was working. (It fell through no fault of his.) He did the job cleaning up any mess that was created as the result of doing so. I will definately have him back to provide some of the other services he list on his profile."
5,Excellent job.Our 50 year old floor looks like new. Very professional and at a very good price.
5,They arrived on time and did a good job.
5,Very prompt in coming for estimate and in doing work when contracted; quality of work appears to be satisfactory; and very low price compared to other estimates.
5,excellent work
4,That went fine.
5,Very professional
4,Short and sweet!
5,Fine
5,Perfect job. Very satisfied
5,He really did a good job.
1,Never showed up.
5,"Extremely well. We didn't realize the cabinets had to be assembled, but Nate forged on and completed the job even though it was bigger than we thought. He did a beautiful job, balancing their placement perfectly and taking the time to make adjustments to make sure they were even. I would call him again for any work I need done."
5,"It was perfect, the guy is great and unbelievable. I will be calling them again for another job."
5,"Nate was a true Professional. Highly recommend him. Punctual, respectful of home, and did a great job."
5,"Nate is a consummate professional, he did an exceptional job and clearly communicated the process for completing the requested work. We are thrilled with the results of Nate’s work and I highly recommend Nate. Nate exceeded our expectations, very timely, professional and he keep his work areas very clean and neat."
5,"Nate was exceptional from beginning to end. When I initially called him with a list of 4 'random' items I needed to have looked at (replace fence posts; replace a railroad tie that we have by our driveway; some siding repair & ceiling issues due to a previous leak), he responded within an hour. He came by later that evening on the way home just to look over the jobs and let me know what he would be able to do (everything except the ceiling). He got back to me with an estimate with 2 days and scheduled the work for approximately 3 weeks in advance. His schedule opened up and he came within a week. Even though he had not done siding repair before, it looked incredible! The fence posts were perfect - very sturdy, and he somehow replaced the railroad tie without having to remove the shrubs right next to it. He was extremely responsible, polite & the clean-up was immaculate. I definitely will use his services in the future and refer him to anyone needing Handyman services. There is a reason he has an 'A' rating."
5,"It went great. Nate communicates before project on his time, shows up at home as scheduled and gets right to work. Once arriving he worked continuously and moved from one project to the next. He is willing to tackle just about anything. His expertise level is superior."
5,He is very good. The work was beautiful I give him 5 Star.
5,Both jobs were well done and priced right. He is excellent.
5,Nate is the best! Always responsive and uses time very efficiently while doing a high quality job. Prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend!
5,"Nate is a good craftsman. He has varied skills that can be used in maintaining a house including minor electrical, fence /gate modifications, drywall repairs, painting, and mounting artwork. I've had to hire him to fix jobs other handymen have botched."
5,"I love my new shiplapped entryway! Nate has helped us with several smaller projects involving ceiling fan and lighting installation. When I reached out to him on a idea to shiplap the entryway, he was ready with solutions. From idea to execution took less than week. Nate is always responsive and reliable. His pricing is competitive and the quality of the work is top notch. We'll continue to seek Nate's help as we dream up new ways to customize our home!"
5,It was excellent! He was ahead of time and very professional.
5,"Excellent, reasonably price, knowledgeable."
5,"Wonderful. Nate responded to my Angie’sList inquiry within 24hrs. Based on my description of work needed, (install a chandelier at about the 18’ height) he gave me quote and projected a callback where we agreed upon the date. As everyone else has reviewed, Nate arrived on time; exercised care when maneuvering an extended ladder through my home; performed the work needed; and cleaned up behind himself beautifully. All I had to do was put my room back together. I have my new go-to person for Handyman needs! Thank you Nate."
5,"Great work once again by Nate. He is a very rare example of providing top notch quality of work and customer service/responsiveness. Not surprisingly, when I first contacted Nate he told me he was backed up a couple of weeks, yet he continually followed up with me until we found a mutually convenient time for him to do the job. I would hire him again in a heartbeat."
5,Nate arrived on time and completed our entire less in less time than I believed possible. The quality of his work is superb. He is the best handyman we have ever used. We would use his services again and we recommend him without reservation.
5,"It went great, the guy was fantastic."
5,Nate showed up on time. He did a very nice job and left the area as clean as if he was never there.. Highly recommended.
5,Nate was on time and got to work right away. He is very conscientious which built my trust in him. Nate did a couple of other small tasks that were not on my original list. He is a true professional and one I will hire again.
5,This is the second time we have utilized Nate's services during the last month. The first was in our current home which we are preparing to sell. We have utilized the services of several handymen during the last 25 years. Nate is not only the best in terms of his range of capabilities but also the best by far in the consistent quality of his work. We wish we had found Nate much earlier. He is straightforward and honest. He works hard and very intelligently. He is friendly. He has our strongest possible recommendation. Nate is the best!
5,"Everything went wonderfully well and it took a lot less time and cost less than I anticipated. Nate did everything from replacing seating straps on porch furniture to replacing screen panels on our screened porch to changing front door hardware to replacing toilet seats to replacing screened porch light fixtures to taking down a wall mounted TV (and the mounting device) to moving furniture, to replacing all door stops, to setting a hinge pins on doors to running an errand to Lowe's, etc, etc. His attitude was great. We would happily utilize his services again."
5,It went well. Nate is always a professional.
5,"By far, one the best I've ever had to my house. First of all, Nate communicates prior to visit and is always prompt with responses. Checks in day before to confirm and arrived on time the next day. As for his work, Nate arrives and gets right to business. Updates me during job and asks me to check out each task as completed. Understands cost-effectiveness for jobs being performed and provides good advice. His skill set is large and he will be my first call next time I need help. I had mostly small tasks but won't hesitate to call on bigger items next time."
5,"Nate is an outstanding service provider. He is a careful and competent professional and his prices are very reasonable. I call him when I have a ""handyman"" job and I highly recommend him to others."
5,"Great! Nate is our ""go-to"" handyman, and as always, he did topnotch work, promptly, professionally, and at a great price. Our bathroom looks terrific."
5,"Nate was very responsive to my inquiry and in providing an estimate. He was able to fit me in earlier than expected and arrived when he said he would. Nate was professional, courteous and did an excellent job. I will definitely reach out to him in the future!"
5,"Excellent. He is really a nice guy. Everything was perfect, he was really good."
5,"Nate was courteous, clean, on time, and knew his stuff. He was in and out in no time. He's definitely worth hiring."
5,"Nate arrived on time and ready to work. We just moved into a new house and had several small jobs to be done, like hang curtain rods, tv wall mounts, remote garage door opener. Nate has also worked for us at our previous house in Charlotte and always does a nice neat job. Will certainly hire again. Need to book in advance"
5,"Did great work. Very responsive to phone calls. Prompt and punctual for appointment, even though it was scheduled on the day of the biggest snowfall of the year."
5,"Wow!!! It's been a long time since we have had someone the caliber of Nate come to do work on our home. He returned our phone call almost immediately...arrived exactly on time...got to work immediately...was thoughtful, professional and kept us in the loop the entire time. And the end result? PERFECT deck steps!!!! He was faced with a problem, quickly analyzed the situation and resolved it and now we have a beautifully fixed deck with some very sturdy amazing steps!! So grateful for Nate's work ethic and skills as a craftsman...like I said, it's been a long time since my husband and I hired a handyman that actually did what he said he was going to do and then went above and beyond to do an excellent job!!! Thank you, Nate - we highly recommend you!!!"
5,"The service was excellent, they were punctual, fair priced and good quality of work."
5,Nate was very responsive...he was able to visit my home and provide an estimate in a very prompt manner. Nate finished the job on time. He did an excellent replacing ceiling sheetrock and painting. Nate left the place spotless. Overall a great experience and I highly recommend him!
5,"Nate was able to fix a number of items around our home, to my wife's delight. He was professional, courteous and reasonably priced. I would recommend Nate to anyone who asked if I ""knew a guy who could fix..."""
5,"Great! Nate is knowledgeable, professional, prompt, and very accommodating. I can always count on him for topnotch service! Work above was performed over two visits."
5,"It was a pleasure having Nate work in my home. He was courteous, punctual, professional, and kept me apprised of his work as he went along - what he had completed, and what he planned to complete the next day. The quality of his work was excellent, and I would not hesitate to recommend him to anybody."
5,"On time, accommodating, friendly, professional, quality service"
5,Responded promptly but told he was not available for few weeks.
5,"Nate fixed some holes and rot on my siding. he was on time, quick, friendly and did a fantastic job! can't even tell there were holes/rot to start with, perfect match. coming out next week to fix/replace my fence and gate and know he'll do a great job. now i just have to make a list of everything on my to do list cause this is the guy i'm going to call. I highly recommend Nate"
5,"Nate is very professional. I wish all service providers were like him. Because Nate lives clear on the other side of the city from me, I took pictures of the projects that needed to be done in order to receive an estimate. Nate got back to me almost immediately with an estimate. After deciding to hire Nate, the job was scheduled with the first day of work to start at 8:30 AM Nate arrived on time and got to work right away and worked through the day only taking breaks to pick up needed supplies and for lunch. The 2nd day of the project was the same. Nate does quality work and doesn't take short cuts. Prior to contacting Nate, I had contacted several others about doing the job. Most of the bids were for less work (such as putting the new vinyl flooring over the top of the old vinyl flooring instead of removing the old flooring first, which is what I wanted) but at a significantly higher cost. For future projects, I will definitely be contacting Nate."
5,"Great. He was professional, timely, did quality work."
5,"Went great. Nate was extremely responsive to my initial call, and he was able to come to my house later that day. He was prompt, professional and did the job exactly as I had hoped. Would definitely call him for other projects."
5,We have used Nate for multiple services now and he has always been great to work with. Very professional and does a very good job. We will continue to use him on future projects and have referred him to friends and family.
5,"Great! I am hiring him again for a double ceiling fan install. He was professional, courteous, punctual, and exceeded all of my expectations."
5,"I wrote a review at the time but I don't see it and I was so impressed with Nate that I am doing it again. Back in the spring we had Nate come and do a couple of hours worth of small tasks and repairs, and then had him come back and pressure wash and stain the deck. He is professional, efficient, timely and goes the extra step. I am so happy to have found him and will definitely use him again."
5,"Very well. Nate called and scheduled the appointment. Arrived on time and gave an approximate time to do the work -- and he finished 45 minutes ahead of estimated time. Very polite, professional, and efficient. He also cleaned up his work area.Would definitely recommend AND hire again."
5,Surperb. He found another rotten piece of wood on the railing that we were unaware of and replaced it without increasing the price of labor. He also replace a piece of weather stripping on the door that he noticed should be replaced.
5,Wonderfully! Called ahead to confirm date/time; very pleasant and efficient...cleaned up too!
5,"Nate was early (which is awesome and something that rarely happens). He was professional and cleaned up after he was finished (also something we haven't seen very often when we've had people do work in our home). There was an issue with the first electrical box being very difficult to remove so it took more time than he planned, so he worked on the first light, left to take care of another customer, then came back to finish the second. He had to replace the existing electrical boxes with the reinforced boxes which we anticipated, so we purchased them along with the fans ahead of time. There was an additional fee of $50 per each fan for Nate to replace the electrical box with the reinforced ones which he let me know ahead of time. If it was a 1:1 swap, there would've been no additional charge."
5,Everything went well. I plan to hire him again to install two lights once the come in.
5,great! very respectful-wonderful experience--professional
5,He Did great work . Will hire again.
5,"Provided an estimate within a day or two, and had availability to execute the work within a few days of my request. He purchased materials and completed the work in one single day. The hand rails that Nate built are much more sturdy than those which were replaced. Nate worked quickly and efficiently. He cleaned up nicely, and was conscientious about providing a ""product"" that met my expectations."
5,Nate called the evening before to confirm the time and showed up on time. He worked the whole and did a great job.
5,I can see why Nate has Service Awards - he is extremely professional and a very nice person. He did a great job installing all 4 of my ceiling fans (2 which were vaulted ceilings) and took the time to ensure that the height was satisfactory. I have a couple of jobs in the near future and he is now added to my phone contacts as the person to call for all of my additional work. The cost was $325.00 which is very reasonable for the job done. Thank you Nate.
5,"Nate was punctual, professional, and worked very quickly. He is definitely someone I would call on again"
5,"On time, very thorough - highly recommend"
5,"Wonderful person to work with. Professional, courteous and reasonable."
5,Nate showed up on time and did great work. I would definitively use him again in the future.
5,"No doubt about it, Nate did more than I had expected and very efficiently. His work attitude is an A+ and he will be on my list for future jobs. His fee is more than fair and he has good communication skills which means alot."
5,"It went great. I loved that I did not have to follow him around to make sure he was staying busy and that he NOTICED stuff. (He was the one who noticed the exterior flood light was broken, and the one that offered to replace the porch light cover.) I initially hired him because he was the only handyman I contacted who could make it out in less than a week and I was concerned about the water. I'll hire him again because he does great work and works quickly."
5,Nate did an excellent job installing the ceiling fan and even came back when the fans didn't work right the first time. Great job
5,Nate was resourceful in providing suggestions on how to seal the concrete gaps on the drive way and patio. He was able to make a quick trip to the local home depot to get the necessary materials and get the job done promptly. Would hire again!
5,"Did a great job, was very careful not to cause any damage to the parts of the door not affected by the install. Cleaned up afterwards and did not leave until I was totally satisfied that the installation was to my satisfaction"
5,Great! Nate was on time and did a great job. Very efficient.
5,"Nate was very professional, completed my to do list quickly and clean. He ask the right questions on hanging my shelf and pictures. They look really good. I appreciate him providing a service to get this type of jobs done. Upon first calling Nate he confirmed an appointment also followed up the day before to make sure everything was on point. I will request his handyman service again. He charged a fair price."
5,"Nate was very professional, on time and very good at his work. I love my ceiling fans. Nate will be the one I call if I ever need electric work done again."
5,Nate is always dependable and does very fine work
5,"Nate is a really nice guy. Job well done, neat and clean. Very respectable friendly person. I would use his services again."
5,"Great! Nate was willing to work me in on short notice. He did a great job, and the price was very fair. I appreciate Nate!"
5,"Nate arrived as promised, finished the work in a timely manner and did a great job. He is friendly and personable. We will use him again and in fact he is coming back in a few weeks to powerwash and stain the deck. Highly recommend."
5,"Went well. He works hard, takes his time and gets the job done. He went above and beyond a simple installation with one of the fans by having to go into the attic because the electrical box was loose and needed some tweaking. It took him longer to install this one particular fan because of that. We appreciated his professionalism. I've used him before and will use him again. Thx, Nate!"
5,went very well. he's a great guy and knows what he's doing. he called and followed up and came back a second time.
5,"Great. Nate is a great communicator, was on time, let us know what he'd need to charge project-by-project, and did great quality work. We recommend him highly."
5,I emailed Nate with the list and he called me back very quickly. I explained what was expected because the house was vacant and we lived in another state. He gave me a very reasonable quote and scheduled to come and do the work and I sent him a more detailed list with pictures. On the day of the work he called to let me know he had arrived and had looked at the work to be done and was ready to go buy supplies. He checked to make sure there were no changes. He spent about 8 hours doing a list of about 21 things including digging out two posts and cementing two new ones on the backyard gate. He took pictures of his work and called me when he had questions. I highly recommend Nate for his professionalism and commitment to detail. The work done was great!
5,Nate did a superb job and was very professional and trustworthy. Price was very fair and quality was great. I would definitely use him again.
5,"He was very efficient and quick. Nice, personable, friendly, and professional."
5,"Nate was right on time and performed the work exceptionally well, and I was very satisfied. Even though his calendar was booked, he made time and came to my house first thing in the morning to install the new microwave. I would not hesitate to call Nate again for any additional work that may arise."
5,"I used Nate in the past for exterior light installation. The cost and work were excellent, so I decided to use him again. Nate did an excellent job this time as well. We had 9 lights installed throughout our home. A lot of the lights had intricate details and strands, which were time consuming to install. Nate assembled and installed everything with ease. I highly recommend him. I will definitely use him again for future projects. Thanks Nate!"
5,He was great! We were moving from one house and bought another house. He came in and did the whole punch list thing for me and I was very impressed.
5,"Did a great job. Had to install an anchor on one, and had to re-work the wiring on one of the light kits. He stuck with it and got it done. Appreciated the effort and would hire again,"
5,"I was blown away at how nice and helpful this guy was-hired him for a small job putting in a door jam but he changed out my smoke detector batteries, all the bulbs on my bedroom light fixture and even hung some of my Christmas lights on my outside bushes so I could use up my minimum time. Loved it-definitely recommend him!"
5,"Excellent work. Nate came out to see what needed doing, gave me a price (not including faucet which I purchased) and came back the next day with his assistant to complete the work."
5,He was prompt and professional. I would highly recommend
5,Nate arrived on time and did the job very quickly. We have about 300' of 6' tall fencing installed 6 months ago that needed weather proof staining front and back. Some areas of the fence panels were coming off the post so Nate fix those areas too. Nate purchased the materials needed and showed us the receipts. There was leftover stain that he left for us to use later on. He is very professional and trustworthy. We will defiantly hire him again.
5,"Nate did a great job , he was on time and the job didnt take long. I would highly recommend him to others. A few months later and I noticed one of the fan blades is a different shade but it hasnt bothered me enough to flip it around."
5,This was an excellent Angies's deal. What I needed done was done at an excellent price with an excellent handyman.
5,"Everything went smoothly. Nate's professionalism is evident in all he does. He responded to all my requests promptly, did the work perfectly, and the cost was more than fair. I highly recommend Nate and will definitely contact him again in the future when the need arises."
5,Nate has done several projects around my house over the past two years and has always done excellent work in a timely fashion at very reasonable prices. Very professional and is always my first call and will continue to be my first call for any handyman work.
5,Very well. Quick and we'll done job
5,Excellent. Was in and out in no time. Everything working fine !
5,"Everything went great! Nate arrived well on schedule, was incredibly friendly, personable and professional. We walked the property and he was open and direct regarding the work he felt needed to be done and wanted to ensure that I was in agreement and that it was the scope of work I had requested. I left him to his work feeling confident that this was a hard working guy with integrity, and he certainly is. I highly recommend him and will certainly hire him again in the future!"
5,This was the second time we have worked with Nate. I texted him and he was at our home within a day to give us an estimate. We had a color already picked out but he suggested a lighter shade and I'm so glad he did. The room looks great. Nate is very professional and so easy to talk with. We will definitely work with him again.
5,"It was great, Nate was able to fit me in the same day I requested service and was fast and clean. I was very happy with the service provided."
5,"Nate did a great job. He got the appointment set up quickly, confirmed it and showed up on time. Work was done quickly and flawlessly. Looking forward to using him on other projects."
5,"Excellent! Nate has provided handyman services before, and I highly recommend him. He is very thorough and does a great job."
5,"This is the second time I've hired Nate to do some work for us. He is always punctual, fair priced and does good work. Would not hesitate to use him again."
5,"I had several small things that I needed to have done. Based on reading the reviews, Nate was my first choice. I definitely was not disappointed! He was on time, professional, and courteous. He takes pride in his work and it definitely shows.I was very pleased with the work performed and should the need arise, I will definitely call on him again."
5,"He has a $100 minimum and it was certainly worth it. These had been installed incorrectly and he had to fix them both. He is very professional, knows what he is doing, is punctual and responsive."
5,"Nate was a very professional guy, and he had an awesome work ethic! He was driven to do the job and to do the job well from beginning to end. He responded quickly to my request for a quote, followed-up, asked questions if he needed me to make a decision during work-in-process, and he kept his word. Nate was a pleasure to work with, and I would definitely recommend him and ask him back. Nate was very conscientious. It amazes me that people have these types of skills because I have none of them at all! It is such a relief to have this work done and done well."
5,Nate was really great to work with. He picked up when I called him the first time and set expectations on when he could perform the work. He was able to perform the work sooner than he originally thought. He communicated well and was organized. He did the job well. I would definitely hire him again and recommend him.
5,Nate was very professional. He worked me in quickly. I plan on hiring him again for future projects
5,"Nate installed a kitchen light fixture, dimmer switch and a bathroom fan/light. Both were difficult to install but especially the bathroom light and fan combo. The fan was very difficult to install because of its location and the difficulty of extracting the old fan. He did an excellent job and I would hire him again and highly recommend him to anyone. He is very nice and easy to work with. Definitely hire him!"
5,"Nate was punctual, courteous, professional, friendly and tidy. We have him scheduled to replace four additional fixtures next week. Could not recommend more highly."
5,"Used the 'Deal' offer and Nate was very responsive as soon as I completed the purchase. He worked me into a very busy schedule, was prompt and very efficient in completely the job. Would definitely recommend and will use him again if need arises. Very happy with price and service provided!"
5,"Used the 'Deal' offer and Nate was very responsive as soon as I completed the purchase. He worked me into a very busy schedule, was prompt and very efficient in completely the job. Would definitely recommend and will use him again if need arises. Very happy with price and service provided!"
5,"Used the 'Deal' offer and Nate was very responsive as soon as I completed the purchase. He worked me into a very busy schedule, was prompt and very efficient in completely the job. Would definitely recommend and will use him again if need arises. Very happy with price and service provided!"
5,"I've used Nate before to hang some fans in the house for me. Always punctual and very pleasant guy and he's priced fairly. Works by himself so he takes his time and is meticulous about the work. Working in the attic was a real pain in the butt. He spent the better part of 3 hours completing the job. He had to wrestle the rotted board out from approx 20 ft up outside, then had to brave the attic heat to finish the job inside. I didn't have a subfloor in attic so we put some boards down for him to place his ladder on to reach the inside attic vent, very tricky business for Nate. He was a real trooper about sticking with the project and seeing it to the end. Fence posts and trim look great. He sanded/ painted and wood filled low seams on trim. He cleans up after himself too. Price included digging and replacing 2 fence posts as well, but I have Poison Ivy in the area so we scrubbed that project. I stuck with price because he worked very hard in hot/ compromising conditions. He is a good handyman."
5,Excellent job install ceiling fan. Very professional and courteous.
5,"He was on time, completed work for quoted price and his work is top notch."
3,"Fan installation was done, but lights in some rooms in my house was not working later! Found the actual problem hard way after 2 days. He did not insulate the wires inside the box which caused the electric arc issue causing short on a circuit in my home. I had to get a licensed electrician an pay $200 to diagnose and fix this problem!! :("
5,couldn't have been easier. Nate knows what he is doing and does a great job
5,"Nate is a very competent workman and very pleasant to be around. He had planned to be at our home for a half day, but stayed all day as we kept adding new tasks to his list. He was very pleasant and patiently keep running to Lowe's/Home Depot to get new parts and supplies as we kept adding to his tasks. This guy is one-in-a million! The above price does not include the substantial bonus we added to Nate's bill to express our gratitude."
5,Nate was very efficient. We will definitely use his services again.
5,"Nate did a great job. Quick, professional and all around nice guy. I hired him to paint my deck and he did a great job with that too."
5,"Great service from Nate. I saw his special on AL and while it didn't match what I needed, I figured it was close enough for me to call him and see if he could do the work. We have switched furniture in a couple of rooms and now the fans did not match the furniture. We wanted Nate to switch the fans for us. He was very responsive on the phone and very helpful in scheduling an appointment quickly. He showed up on time and was done in less than an hour. The $99 is his minimum charge. Excellent service and work and highly recommended."
5,Great - will use again for other work
5,Nate was fantastic. Very helpful and actually performed more services than originally agreed upon as we realized the task was more involved. Would definitely hire Nate for any household improvement needs.
5,Nate was able to replace one and then he had to come back since I was not able to install the second one. He was very helpful and will be using him again.
5,"Nate communicated with me promptly after service was purchased, setup time and arrived as discussed. Once on premises, job was completed fast, efficiently and with good quality. I can highly recommend Nate."
5,Nate was great! He worked so hard and did a great job. He was very fast and cleaned up after himself. We will definitely use him again.
5,"He was very fast, efficient, and pleasant. He came the same day I contacted him which was fabulous."
5,Very professional and considerate. One of the best and will use him for all home repairs. I highly recommend Nate.
5,"I highly recommend Nate. He confirmed his appointment, arrived promptly and worked tirelessly. There were some issues with the items I gave him to install and he worked around them, bought the additional parts necessary to complete the job and performed additional electrical work that was required. Nate routinely gets excellent reviews and if you use him you will see why. He is accommodating, friendly and neat. He doesn't take shortcuts and seems to do every job as if it was his own house."
5,"All went well. Arrived on time, work done efficiently and cleaned up afterwards. Nate was very professional and was able to look at a few other jobs I was considering while he was there."
5,Nate was professional and efficient.
5,Nate did a great job - very professional and efficient.
5,Excellent handyman. Was very prompt and responsive prior to the appointment. Showed up on time and was friendly and professional. Handled both jobs I needed with ease. Results were great. Would use again.
5,Went well. He was pleasant and provided good quality work. Plus he went a step further and corrected poor installation of old fan.
5,Nate was easy to schedule the service with. He arrived right on time and was very professional. I had purchased an Angie's List deal but needed an additional light fixture installed that was not part of the deal so he gave me a very fair price and completed all of the work. I am happy with the results and would use him again.
5,"Last part of the kitchen remodel. The old backsplash had been taken out some time back while we were doing the countertops. Took time to find the right backsplash material and when finally installed, there were a few places where new drywall was needed. Nate came (on time) the first day, scoped the job, went to get materials, and came back to begin work. Was a two day job, to allow drywall mud to set, then sand, etc. Painted it after that and bam -- done."
5,Service was prompt and friendly. Will definitely call again and recommend to friends.
5,Nate did an excellent Job! He is very nice and courteous and he went above and beyond what was necessary to get the paint job done. He also did an excellent job cleaning up afterwards! I will absolutely use him again in the future!
5,Nate was very professional and did an awesome job. He was on time and before I knew it he was finished. I would highly recommend Nate and will definitely send business his way.
5,"Midway through the initial install (3 fans removed and 2 replaced) I realized the replacements I ordered were too small. Nate was understanding, accommodating, and indicated he was fine foregoing payment until he returned to install the correct sized fans. I offered to pay him twice for the fans that were switched twice, but even if I hadn't I don't think he would have been offended. At the end of the day, you want a competent, conscientious and trustworthy guy in your house and Nate is just that. Don't pay an electrician for fan/lighting work. I've completed several fan installs myself, but now I'd rather leave it to a pro, and Nate is just that. We will have him back again!"
5,"I joined Angie's List to find a competent and reliable Handyman. I spent a good amount of time reviewing the ones that had A ratings. Even though there were quite a few I felt best about the reviews for Updates by Nate. I decided to try one of the deals that he offered to replace 2 light fixtures. I thought it would be a good opportunity to see how things went. Nate arrived on time, he was both friendly and professional and he made sure I was happy with everything he did. Since the first experience went well I had him come back out to do some additional items. One of the things that I liked best is that Nate did all of the work himself so I did not have multiple people for different tasks. He is also very neat and he cleaned up everything before he left. I will definitely use him for additional projects in the future."
5,I would highly recommend Nate. We purchased a deal on Angie's List and Nate contacted me immediately. He scheduled the install the following day and did a great job.
5,"Nate was very professional and completed the work in a timely manner. He cleaned up after the job and you would never have know he was there. I was impressed as he had only had foot surgery about 2 weeks before coming out to install our fans. He worked around our bed, which one of the fans hangs over, so we would not have to take it apart and move it. I was very impressed with his service and professionalism."
5,"Nate is a skilled and friendly professional. Work was scheduled promptly, completed quickly and to perfection. Could not be happier with the end result. Highly recommended."
5,"Nate emailed within 24 hours to schedule. He came by the next day for estimate, and said that he could go ahead and do the work that day! I was thrilled! He was in and out in about an hour and a half. My bathrooms look great, ready for holiday guests."
5,Great! The provider was extremely responsive (we had several email exchanges while I was purchasing the lights). His communication was prompt. He arrived on time and cleaned up afterwards! I would definitely recommend Nate Handyman Services and will definitely use him again for a number of house projects.
5,Called before service arrived on time. Very quick and professional. Will definitely hire again.
5,Nate was fantastic and I will definately use his service again in the future.
5,Nate was great. Pinged me to let me know traffic was bad and he'd be a few minutes late. He fit me in his schedule as I was off all week. Work was very good and he pointed out several issues that I needed a plumber and a qualified electrician to take care of. I will definitely use Nate again. I plan on having him come out to do outside repairs if the weather co-operates.
5,"Nate has helped us out with a couple of projects in our fixer-upper. Recently he helped install some large cabinets in our kitchen. What should have been an simple job turned into a full morning due to our uneven flooring. He refused to leave the job undone, and was actually more of a perfectionist than I am. Nate is always pleasant, easy to reach and goes out of his way to make sure we're satisfied with the end product. We'll definitely be calling him again as we continue to work on our ""to-do"" list"
5,Nate was very responsive. He came out and looked at our deck before making recommendation of how to treat. Additionally he helped us select the product to be applied. We bought the restore product and had it ready for him. Nate came out a day early to remove the deck furniture and pressure wash. Next day he was back early and worked all day applying the product. Deck is 20x12 with 3 steps to the yard and rails on 2 sides. Excellent job. We are very pleased and highly recommend Nate's services.
5,Nate did a great job of taking down the old ceiling fans and replacing them with new ones. Would definitely use again.
5,Nate did a great job. He was professional and meticulous. Even cleaned the new fixtures to remove dust and hand prints. Will definitely contact him for future needs.
5,"The job went well. Nate was punctual, professional and did a quality job."
5,"I purchased the Angie's List deal to have ceiling fans installed and it took Nate a few days to get back to me because he was out of town. However, once he returned, he phoned to schedule a time to come out. I was delayed and once I was ready, scheduling was easy and he was on time. He was quick and quiet (I have newborns who were napping). His work was great."
5,Nate called me back immediately and quickly came to the rescue to help get our house ready to sell. His attention to detail and quality of work was impeccable. This is the second time I used Nate and I highly recommend his services.
5,Nate showed up on time. He constructed the ceiling fan quickly and installed. The ceiling fan he removed to be replaced with the new one was installed in a different location. He brought all equipment and tools needed. he was polite and efficient. he was there probably only an hour.
5,"This is the 2nd time we've hired Nate to do work for us, and it went great. He was willing to work on a Saturday morning, which really helped us out. He showed up on time, and worked quickly. He also put together another set of shelves that I was planning to finish, but didn't. After he left I noticed that the shelves were not secure to the drawers. I called him and he came back and secured them right away. We are very happy with our new office furniture!!"
5,"He arrived on time and he was done in less 90 minutes, very impressed, will hire him again, his reviews speak for themselves."
5,"Nate did an excellent job. Was prompt, courteous and cleaned up debris from the install. I would highly recommend his services."
5,"Great service. Nate was clean, efficient and knew what he was doing. He did a great job!"
5,"Prompt, professional, good work - he came to do the work when promised, cleaned up after, and worked efficiently. Will call him again for my next projects."
5,Went great. He was professional did the job clean and quickly. all around good guy. I would for sure use him in future projects.
5,He worked fast and did a great job.
5,"I had had Nate install some ceiling fans previously. As with the first experience, he was responsive in scheduling and the finished work was exactly as expected/needed."
5,"Nate did a great job, he was prompt and was easy to work with!"
5,"Nate was very responsive, timely, a great communicator and a pleasure to work with. Seems very competent for basic handyman work."
5,"Nate did a excellent job for me. This is my second time using his company for odd jobs. He is fast, professional, and takes pride in doing the job right the first time."
5,EXCELLENT!!! Showed up on time and installed the fans without any delays.
4,"It was good. He was very nice and very professional. He came, did the work and put his ladder back and everything was on a professional scale. When he couldn't make it he did call back and tell us exactly when he would be here."
5,"Nate installed 5 fans for me. No problems. He was responsive to my emails, showed up on time, and provided the service without any issues. I purchased the 2 fans for $99, and got the other ones installed at approx $75 each. One of my fans was apparently missing a piece and Nate was kind enough to go to Lowes during his install to pick up a replacement. Nice customer service, I'd use him again. Thx, Nate!"
5,"Very professional, prompt and patient. Works very fast but his quality of work can't be beat. I recently moved and needed some handyman work done so I reached out to Nate and he responded almost immediately. I will definitely hire again and will be sure to share his information with friends."
5,"Nate was prompt, professional, and got the job done! I would definitely call him for other handyman jobs."
4,"Nate did a very good job. I purchased the installation special through Angie's List. He showed up on time. He went above and beyond the special as I was not aware it did not include chandelier installation. My chandelier has at least 100 decorative ornaments that had to be hung on it. A very time consuming project. But with the help of my boyfriend, Nate completed that and another regular fixture in about an hour. The installation instructions of the chandelier said it would take a minimum of 2 hours. My chandelier looks great and it changed the look of the room. He agreed. I wanted to get a quote from him to install more fixtures in my house where there are currently none. But he informed me that since he is not a licensed electrician he could not install fixtures where they aren't previously preinstalled. If he was, I would definitely use him again"
5,"I called Nate at 8.15am on a Monday morning. He called me straight back and had taken a cancellation for the same morning. He arrived at the house atapproximately 9.45 am. He was polite, courteous and very professional. The job was taken care of and finished by 10.15 am. I would definetely use Nate again."
5,Nate was able to schedule my work today because of a cancellation. He arrived on time and efficiently installed the ceiling fan in a 10 ft ceiling. Took about 40 minutes and we were very pleased with the work. He was courteous & friendly. Will definately use him again.
5,Showed up promptly and went to work. completed job and area was very clean. he had time to replace two GFI outlets that had burned out. Excellent experience.
5,Very good experience! this is our 2nd time hiring a handyman to install ceiling fans. It took the first guy approx. 4 hrs to install two. It took Nate approx. 1 hr to install two ceiling fans. GREAT JOB!
5,Perfect - could not have been better or easier!
5,"On time, good work. This is the 2nd time I've used Nate's services. The price was for two installs, but I had just one."
5,"Great job. Very professional and friendly. As requested, he gave me a heads up when he was on his way so I could be prepared. He was very fast and clearly knowledgeable about the job at hand."
5,Nate was responsive for scheduling and arrived in the timeframe scheduled. He was pleasant and professional. I also plan to have him complete a few other projects at some point based on our conversation.
5,"Nate was great. His cost was very affordable at $75 a fixture, and he was running a special on top of that of 2 fixtures for $99. He was friendly (even showed me a picture of his new pup, Ranger, after meeting our dogs) and very professional. He was able to work with a beautiful, yet pain in the butt, light fixture that I had bought for our dining room, and even had me come take a look before he screwed it in to make sure it was exactly where I wanted it. While he was there, I inquired about the cost to replace our foyer pendant light, and not only was it the same price (despite the height) but he offered to do it that same day and come back after his next job. Other service providers on Angie's List had quoted me between $220 and $300 due to the height of the ceiling, but he said as long as his ladder could reach, it was no extra charge. Also, we had a wiring issue with the light over our kitchen island. Whenever we turned on the light, the back porch light also came on, so we couldn't have one on without the other. Even though we didn't ask him to fix this, we noticed after he left that these lights are now functioning correctly and each operate by separate light switches! He must have corrected the issue when replacing the light over the kitchen island. Whether it was intentional or a result of just proper installation, it was much appreciated! I would highly recommend Nate and will definitely use him for future services!"
5,"Nate was fantastic. Very fast, polite, cleaned everything up. I wish all service providers were as on the ball!"
5,Nate showed up early and went right to work. He fixed a bathroom faucet handle and tightened the other handles in the bathroom along with stripping out the old caulk in our master bath shower and recaulked it. Nate also looked at my doorbell and even ran to a home improvement store to buy a replacement and came back and installed it for me even though this was not on the original list of items for him to do. He was very professional and I highly recommend him.
5,"My very old front porch light fixture bit the dust and needed replaced ASAP for security/safety. I found Nate's Company and he immediately contacted me. Everything went great! He arrived on time as I took a couple of hours off from work for the 8:00 a.m. appointment not knowing how long it would take. Nate actually came over early to accommodate my schedule even though he was already booked for the whole day. I talked with him while he did the removal and installation of the light fixture. Found out he does all handyman jobs, not just electrical, so told him about other home repairs I need done down the road and will contact him again!"
5,FANTASTIC job especially under the circumstances. took everything in stride where some may have walked out. am actually compiling my list to have him come to our new home to do some work.
5,"Nate worked around my schedule so that I could leave work and meet him at my home when he was available. He was prompt, courteous, and professional. The work was done in a manner consistent with my expectations. He did an excellent job."
5,His services will be provided by the end of August.
5,"I had issues trying to install them myself and needed professional help. Based on my past experience working with Nate, I called him. We set up a time 2 weeks away as he had a full schedule for the next 2 weeks. He called back within an hour saying he was around my part of town and could install them right away as whatever he was working on hit a snag and needs to wait for parts. Within an hour we had perfectly installed curtain rod, he even touched up one of the sconces that I chipped trying to install, saving me $$. He is very punctual and professional and mild mannered. He would be the first one I will call if I need any handyman services."
5,Awesome! Nate came when promised (quickly) and timely! Did the job quickly. Looking at the many jobs I can have him come back to do.
5,It went very well and he did great.
5,"He mounted the TV to the wall. The work he did was excellent. He also did work at my gym doing various jobs. He was very fast, responsive and efficient. I would use him again and his prices are reasonable. He also utilizes his time very well."
3,fan -he removed one cosmetic part from the fan and it does not look nice without that part especially when this fan is in the living room
5,Actually worked very hard with old wiring installing new fans and light packages. nate was very professional and punctual. I would use him again any time and highly recommend.
5,Provider was very punctual. Work was done very quickly and professionally. I would recommend service to another customer
5,It went great. He even waited for me to change a parts. Great services .
5,He was very thorough and professional. He was friendly as well.
5,It went great! I’ve already had him back to do other work for me.
5,Nate was professional and he called ahead and arrived on time. He went right to work installing 2 fans with lights and a remote switch. One was on a vaulted ceiling about 12 feet and he had no problem completing the task. He is very nice and quick. In and out in about 1 1/2 hrs. I will definitely use him again for other projects.
5,Nate was great! Very professional and did an outstanding job.
5,Nate is very responsive and does an excellent job. He is courteous and professional. I would recommend his services to anyone looking for help on household projects.
5,"He was on time, which I really appreciated. He also did a terrific job! He did what he had to do, cleaned up everything, and was out quickly. I am very satisfied with his work."
5,Perfect. I'm glad I used this service instead of doing it myself. He was on time and very professional. No issues whatsoever. Nate had the work done in about 1 hour. Amazing. Highly recommend.
5,Nate was on time and communicated quickly. He installed everything in a timely manner and gave us a quote just by listing the jobs needing to be done. I would recommend Nate to anyone else.
5,We were happy with the work the gentleman gave us. The service was done right after the purchase was made. There was no extra charge. He did a very good job. It was a great service. It was a great deal. We enjoyed it and we plan to do it again.
5,The work done by Nate was great. He was able to installed quickly and without any issue. I will use his company again in the future for another project in my garage.
5,"They did a great job. They did the job very shortly after I bought the big deal, I don't remember at this point in time. It went over because I had them do a couple of extra things. He was just friendly, smart and hardworking guy. He's just the type of person you'd trust having in your house and he's making sure he's always doing the right thing. He didn't seem like the guy that he would cut corners at all. He always wanted to do everything 100% or not at all. I will absolutely use him again."
5,"Great. Fast and efficient. Very professional, and nice, guy."
5,"Great, no problems. Everything went as expected."
5,"On time, attentive, courtious. Texted the night before for verification and made sure we had all the parts we needed. Be very careful and lock up your pets (I had a cat get out and and to take off work to find her, even though he was warned). I think $180 was a little steep for about 1.5 hours work, but it was something we couldn't do, and he was very nice enough to give us the name of someone we could rent a ladder from should we need it in the future."
5,Nate and I had to reschedule the first time around because I didn't have everything that was needed to move the first fan from a flat ceiling to a vaulted one. He was very punctual and professional and was able to complete the install in less than 2 hours. I would definitely recommend him!
5,"This gentleman was very professional, however, I decided to go with another company instead."
5,"We were very appreciative of Nate's responsiveness and willingness to do the repairs as requested by the buyer of our home, so that the sale could go through on schedule! His prices were also very reasonable, especially considering the variety of repairs completed."
5,"Great. Nate is a neat, very professional worker . When I asked h to repppp"
5,"Everything went very well with Nate. He was punctual , knowledgeable and a good communicator. Would use him again."
5,"Nate did an outstanding job! It was definitely worth the money! Nate was punctual, professional and even cleaned up! I would definitely hire Nate again!"
5,I ended up paying more than the $99 Big Deal purchase price because the Deal was for two fans and I had four installed. The price was good and he did a good job.
5,Fantastic - excellent - professional.
5,"Nate arrived promptly and communicated his arrival, was very professional, explained what he intended to do and gave me my money's worth. Couldn't ask for a better experience with a service provider. Highly recommended."
5,OMG. Poor Nate. no one had any idea how bad it was under the tiles---but he powered on like a trooper--was always working and the floor looks fantastic and no more cat smell!
5,"Everything went fine. He installed a water shut off supply valve for a toilet, he re-wired a fluorescent light fixture, installed a shower surround in a bathroom, and adjusted front door striker plate that had been sticking. He also did some caulking."
5,"Nate was awesome, did a fantastic job. Would certainly hire him again."
5,The man came out and stated they couldn't do the work unless I had the parts. He was very nice.
5,"Install went well. Nate was a cool professional guy. No mess was left. he was quick, would mos def use him again."
5,"He was punctual, quick and courteous... we had to troubleshoot the fan that hangs from a drop ceiling. His ingenuity and flexibility won the day. Job well done and I will hire again when I need another fan installed."
5,"Nate was on time, he listened to my requests. He installed both the light fixtures. It is hard to find handyman like him. I am absolutely using him again, for my next job."
4,"Nate was professional, timely and did good work. Three of the installations were very high. We rented a ladder which he helped my husband unload, load and bring back to the rental place. He has a great sense of humor and was very responsive. He increased the price, which I think was fair, but it ended up being a little higher than I expected"
5,"Nate did a fantastic job and we considered the price to be very reasonable. In addition,Nate was flexible with his schedule and very accommodating. We are very pleased with the end result and will utilize Nate again in the future for any additional projects or repairs in our home."
5,We realized the fan was shipped without the blades so Nate was nice enough to come back a second time when the blades arrived to hang the fan. He did a great job. He was very responsive and very professional.
5,"Excellent work - Thanks Nate. If you need things done around your house - this is the guy to call. Very neat, professional, and understanding of your needs. I found him to be responsibly priced, efficient, and caring."
5,"I had an animal go through my screen door and ruined the screen. Found Nate on AL and he was able to come out that day and fix it. He was very easy to work with; I wasn't able to meet him so he trusted me to send me a bill later for payment. I was very impressed with Nate, and will call him again for all of my future needs, and, being a Realtor, will refer him to my clients"
5,"Nate arrived on time, had everything he needed to perform the tasks we contracted. The ceiling light went up without a hitch in about 20 minutes. I then mentioned that I would like his help installing our microwave which would complete the installation of new appliances in our new kitchen. He agreed and despite some difficulty with changing the bracket and conversion of one brand to another, it went pretty smoothly. The amount of effort he put into the installation of the overhead fixture was impressive. He was not going to leave until it was done properly, professionally and looking better than the work done by the builder's contractors in installing the light. Nate seems to be able to do just about anything around the house, interior or exterior. We spoke about some other possible projects that we wish to undertake in the future and he will be first on my list to call. Thanks, Nate for being part of the Angie's list family!"
5,Nate arrived on time and got right to work. Nate was not only friendly but he also got the job done. I would absolutely use Nate again.
5,"I was very impressed with his work. He was on-time and completed the job to my satisfaction, I will definitely use him in the future for additional projects."
5,"He was great. It was the 99 dollars for the big deal. It was just him. He was great. He was pretty much in and out. He did the work, the fan work and rewired the pad. He was fine. It was just him. He was fine. It was like within a week of buying the big deal that he got it done. I don't remember him being late. I don't remember what time he was supposed to come but his work was fine."
5,"Very professional, responsive and he did a great job."
5,"Nate responded in an expedient manner to our request for a timely service. We had two jobs which had to be completed prior to our household goods being delivered to our new residence. Nate understood our situation and came out the next day. Nate was very personable, quick, neat, professional, timely, and affordable. We couldn't ask for a better experience. I highly recommend his services and we will utilize Nate in the future."
5,He was so attentive and got back to me right away. He came and took alot of extra time on the job. Nate was very courteous and made sure to complete everything before he went out of town.
5,"I called Nate the day I received the smoke detectors via UPS and he gave me an appointment the very next day, which was excellent. The smoke detector in my bedroom was continuously chirping, so Nate's prompt appointment was greatly appreciated. He did a very good job replacing the old smoke detectors with the new ones. He was punctual, efficient and professional. I am very happy with his work and I intend to use his services again in the future."
5,"I had a great experience the first time using Angie's List. After going through tons of reviews I settled on Nate Handyman Service and was quite pleased with the entire transaction. Nate is professional and friendly. After I bought the coupon for ""2 ceiling fans/light fixture installation"" I asked Nate if he could work me in within the next few days as I was having out of town guests within the week. Nate was more than accommodating and kept in contact with me via Angie's List / cell phone up until the time he arrived to install my lights. I will say that Nate was quite patient with me when I realized that I missed several areas of my DYI painted chandalier as I completed a few paint touch-ups. He was also able to give great guidance on proper ceiling height for my lights. I will definitely use Nate Handyman Service in the future!"
5,Nate was very professional and worked well on each of the projects. He was neat and efficient. Nate is a very nice guy and I felt very comfortable with him in our home. I look forward to having him back! I would gladly recommend him.
4,My experience was okay. He came out on time for the appointment. He was courteous and professional. Scheduling an appointment took a while and I had to call them to get something scheduled.
5,"If there was ever a ""perfect"" handyman experience this was it ! Honestly, after a string of ""Handyman Specials"" gone wrong or at best just barely OK.......This was PERFECT ! Response, punctuality, professionalism, everything just as it should be. Nate two fans down and installed two NEW fans in less than 2 hours. Very polite and respectful young man."
5,"Nate was a little backed up schedule-wise when I purchased the deal, which was fine, because I had a lot going on for a couple of weeks myself. He did reach out to me once when he had an unexpected opening the next morning, but I couldn't make the appointment work with my schedule. When my schedule started to open up, I gave him a call. We arranged a date and time roughly a week out. He texted me the night before he was scheduled to arrive to confirm the time would still work. He showed up promptly, and in under 30 minutes had the outdoor light installed. Then he went to work on the fan, which he wrapped up in about 45 more minutes. Nate is a friendly, efficient handyman and after wrapping up the fan, he spent a few minutes with me talking through options for a door issue I have in one room. I asked him his thoughts on it and if he could replace the full-sized door with another option and he was frank with me about the cost and complications around that and recommended I speak to some folks at Lowe's who specialize in door installations for a less expensive option. I appreciated his honesty. We always need a good handyman for general things around the house, and I asked for Nate's card so I could call him again the next time something comes up that we need help with. I highly recommend him and his work!"
5,On time and quick. I left the house and when I got back they were both up and working. Would use again!
5,"Nate was very quick to respond when I purchased the deal on Angie's list. A few days later I had to reschedule and he was actually able to work us in even earlier than was originally scheduled. He replied to all my emails very promptly. He called about 30 minutes prior to arrival, which is helpful to a busy mom who spends more time in her minivan than at home. After he installed one of the fans, I realized that I purchased the wrong size extension rod. Nate had to take down the fan and reinstall it with the correct length rod. Because of this, it took a lot longer than expected, but there were no additional charges for having to take down the fan and reinstall, even though it was my mistake that I purchased the wrong length rod. We will definitely use Nate again in the future for various handyman jobs, and are thankful that we found him through Angie's List."
5,We have tall ceilings which was not a problem for Nate. Some places we called charged more for high ceilings. He had to make some adjustments to the brackets which he did with no problem. One of the fans was a little wobbly so he even came back out to fix it when he was in the area. I would not hesitate to recommend Nate.
5,"Nate was so nice. He fit us in at the earliest slot in his schedule, which was very much appreciated! Very professional, prompt and did very nice work. Will call Nate again for other work!"
5,"He did a great job. ALL of our fixtures turned out to be challenging installs, but he was able to get them all up. The chandelier is about 10 feet up in the air over the stairs landing and so he had to hang over the railing at the top of the stairs and balance himself on a ladder over the 10 foot drop to install it. If we need anymore lights installed I would definitely use him again."
5,"We initially bought the 2 fan installation but then decided to add additional work such as the dimmer and moving one fan to another room. He was very professional while assembling the units by cleaning up after each install and was very respectful of our home, and then he did the additional unexpected work without a fuss. He was promptly on time, very reasonable and competitive in his pricing, pleasant demeanor, and great workmanship. We would highly recommend him and his company."
5,"Nate was extremely responsive, very professional, courteous and very competitively priced. He was able to meet both my requests in terms of providing a free estimate as well as scheduling and performing the work. Overall we are very happy with our to use Nate and look forward to calling on his services again the future."
5,"Nate arrived a little early, which was fine. We had originally asked him to hang three drapery rods, but only had the hardware for two (our fault). He installed them quickly and also repaired a bedroom door that was sticking. He was polite, easy to get in touch with and I thought very reasonably priced. Not only will I use him again, but friends have asked for his number."
5,Nate was responsive to my request and provided a much needed service. He put together both ceiling fans and installed them in a little over an hour. Originally he was booked out for 3 weeks but was able and willing to move his time frame up. I would definitely use him again.
5,"He was able to accommodate my schedule. He was friendly and professional. Came in and went straight to work. Seemed to be a nice guy, and was in an out in about an hour. I'm already planning to hire him again."
5,"It went really well. I had them install a ceiling fan and it looks really nice. I supplied the fan and there were no issues with the installation. Scheduling was painless and easy, too. I'd use them again."
5,"The service was great. Nate was punctual and friendly. I showed him the projects I wanted completed, and he started right away. Both the ceiling fan and outdoor light work great!"
5,Nate was on time for the job and replaced everything as asked. He showed me how each fan worked and pointed out that the marks from the previous fixtures might need some touch-ups.
5,I purchased Nate's fan installation deal. Nate was an absolute professional. He got the job done and gave me a great price to install an additional light. I will absolutely use him again for other jobs as I have them. He exactly what I hoped to find by joining Angie's list.
5,Nate was very professional. I would highly recommend!!!
5,Nate installed four sets of shutters for me. He was easy to communicate and schedule with and even came out twice because we discovered (when he was here the first time) that one of the sets of shutters was damaged and had to be re-ordered. He made multiple trips to home improvement stores to get the correct anchors and drill bits so that the shutters could be installed correctly (in brick) with the screws that came with the shutters (which were already painted the same color as the shutters). I will definitely call Nate again.
5,"The installation couldn't be scheduled as quickly as I would've liked, I also could only use 1 voucher per residence. 9I needed to install 4 lights.) The communication from the service was excellent."
5,He is very pleasant. Nice appearance. Would definitely not hesitate to call him again.
5,"He was punctual, friendly and went above and beyond the call of duty. Rode to Home Depot with me to get new fixtures and was a saint and patient."
5,"We set up an appointment for two weeks out and the day before he started contacting me to my cell phone. My cell phone was dead and he tried email and finally went to Angies list and looked up my home number Talk about thorough and persistent. He contacted me and confrmed our appointment and showed up on time and started work immediately. The job was perfect, he was pleasant and you would make a mistake not to use him."
5,"We scheduled a time and he came over. Unfortunately, he was not able to install the lights due to the odd wiring behind the existing light. He said that since he was not a licensed electrician he was not able to mount the lights with complete certainty because the wiring was so old. He was very polite and nice about the situation and told me to send you guys an email for a refund on the money. Thank you!"
5,Nate went out of his way to stop by the house on his way home from another job to fix our soffit.
5,Nate did a great job. He was very professional and I would use him again and recommend him to others.
5,"Nate was very responsive when first getting the quote, and that that continued throughout the project. He showed up on time, did a great job ( in the blistering heat ) , and cleaned up when done. Very easy to work with and that is a huge plus. We would not hesitate to work with him again."
5,Nate was on time...actually a little early and went right to work. He had a good understanding of what to do and how to do it. He kept the areas clean while working and moved the furniture back in place when the job was completed.
5,"Job was great! Nate was here when he said he would be, cleaned up all debris, moved the old fans to the garage for me (without asking), and moved the bedroom furniture back into place, again without my asking. I would definitely use him again."
5,Nate arrived right on time and did a great job. He was extremely professional and pricing was very fair. We will definitely use again.
5,"Nate did a great job, and I would recommend and use again in the future!!!!"
5,Nate was very professional and everything went off as expected - no unpleasant surprises. Couldn't ask for anything more.
5,"Nate was very professional. He answered my message promptly, as well as my additional messages. He was on time & did a great job. I would highly recommend him. He replaced the two shutters that had fallen of the front of my house & did a fantastic job staining my deck."
5,"Nate was fantastic! Hard worker and smart. He had to install 2 fans in rooms with old electrical wiring and make it work. One room had a low ceiling and he had to figure out how to install a fan flush mounted - it was missing the original pieces for flush mounting but he figured it out. He reinstalled this fan after discovering the fan would be too low with the extension pole - he didn't complain or object, just did it. He had not previously installed an undercounter light fixture but was able to figure that out as well. It was a tight space and hard to remove the old light And the new light actually had a small plastic part that was broken causing one of the bulbs not to turn on. He used super glue and got it to work. Can't say enough good about him. Very professional - returned my calls, showed up on time, did an excellent job and cleaned up. Will definitely use again and recommend highly!"
5,Nate was very friendly and professional. He did a fine job which met our expectations
5,"Nate did a fantastic job. He was punctual and professional. He switched out one fan for another. He also took down a long florescent light and put up a new, very different fixture. He was thorough and patient with a potentially tricky job and made sure I was happy with the work. He also was very easy to communicate with and flexible with scheduling. I would not hesitate to hire him again in the future. In fact, I have already recommended him to a friend."
5,"If you stop to check another provider in this category, you're wasting your time. Nate is the guy you want. On-time (I was actually a few minutes late), organized, knowledgeable, personable, creative...there is no reason to use anyone else. If the job is in his wheelhouse (and he'll tell you if it is), then give him the assignment, stand back, and prepare to be pleased. Remember, I told you up front that you're wasting your time viewing any other provider's listing. This is the guy you want."
5,"When I first bought the ""Deal"" Nate sent me an email saying he would try to schedule me in right away, Within 2 weeks he called me to set an appointment. That same day he came over and installed my 2 lighting fixtures. He was efficient, and very professional."
5,"We are so grateful to have found Nate. We contacted him based on reviews from others. He was very friendly on the phone, and was punctual the day of the appointment. He spent 8 hours at our office helping to hang curtains, pictures, etc. What we are most impressed with was the fact that he is a problem solver. We realized half way through that there was no way for the curtain wires we purchased to work with the builiding infrastructure. Nate immediately suggested an alternate solution and even volunteered to go to Lowe's to get all the parts. Our office looks amazing thanks to him! We will definitely contact him again."
5,"It went really well! I've had no issues since they did the install. This was the first time I had used them, and I would use them again in the future as well as recommend them to others."
5,I purchased the deal on Sunday and he worked us in on Monday and did an excellent job. Will use him in the future.
5,"He did great work. He called me within days of me buying the coupon and then, he came out and I had them install very high ceiling fans. He had all his own equipment. He is very clean, neat, and fixed actually another overhead nook because the siding has not aligned up right where he was putting it. He fixed that for me as part of the process at no charge. I just spent the $99 Big Deal."
5,"They did a wonderful job, cleaned up and everything was fine. I will use them again in the future."
5,"Nate is nice, professional, and did an excellent job. His pricing is reasonable. I have asked him to price out additional work for me. I totally recommend him."
5,"Nate is FABULOUS!!! I contacted Nate by email through the Angie's List link. He responded to my email by end of day, came to review our needs within a day, gave us ideas of possible solutions to problem areas, and provided a quote that evening which included labor and materials. I scheduled a date for job to be within a few days. He arrived on time and went right to work. Nate is very detailed, knowledgeable, efficient, professional, and went the extra distance to assure my satisfaction. He cleaned up the area as he finished a job. When finished, he walked through with me to be sure he fulfilled all jobs and to my expectations. He assured me that if we had any problems to let him know. We couldn't be happier. We DEFINITELY recommend Nate. He is very personable, friendly, and clean cut...a pleasure to work with and have in our home. Thank you, Nate. We will see you again!"
5,"Nate arrived promptly on the day of the appt. I showed him the fans to be installed and the extra downrods I purchased for installation. Nate explained why the extra hardware was not needed (which was great because I saved money) and began work immediately. He took pride in his work, including ensuring the fans did not shake when turned on higher settings. I am very pleased with his work and plan to use his services again."
5,Fantastic Job! Nate does a professional job!
5,Nate went item by item through the home inspection report and took care of each item. He purchased caulk and other items and only charged for the amount of materials and work that it took. I would definitely use Nate again if we ever need any type of handy man services!
5,"Nate was terrific. He called, we set up a time, he arrived on time, did the work, cleaned up, left. One of the fixtures was a bit difficult, but Nate solved the problem. He's also professional, polite and pleasant. We've got other projects for which I will be calling Nate."
5,"We spoke over the phone about the project, and after I explained what I wanted/needed done, he told me he had never done an electrical box swap. I appreciate his honesty, but have found someone else who is more experienced with that to do the project."
5,small problems finding a time that worked for him and us. but after that everything was perfectly done. He worked very h****** one of the exterior lights that had a poorly installed box. To the point of pulling it off and re-installing it.
5,Nate was on time and professional and did not make a mess! I will use his services again!
5,Great! Nate is the best and I am a very hard to please customer!
4,He did it very well and was very nice and professional. I planned to have him back to put up the paneling but I'm having to wait for Dry Pro to correct the flooding when it rains in the basement.
5,"Nate was easy to reach and responded quickly. He set the appointment, reconfirmed it and appeared right on time. We ran into a couple unexpected issues in installation which Nate handled easily and cheerfully. Very professional in his interactions with customer. His work is well done, good quality. I would highly recommend Updates by Nate and would use his services again."
5,Nate showed up on time and completed the job in a timely fashion. I would definitely use Nate again.
5,Nate was great! Very professional and an excellent job. I plan to use him again soon.
5,"It went great, he did and great job."
5,It went great. He installed ceiling fan an and remote in less than 1 hour; then replaced the Entryway light in less than 1/2 hr.
5,Nate arrived right on time and went straight to work. He managed to install a light fixture that needed a few alterations in order to work. These two installations weren't the standard and he did an excellent job with no complaints about the time it was taking. Definitely would hire Nate for future projects.
5,Very efficient. Nate is the best! Very professional! Outstanding work! Would use him again!
5,"Nate is very professional and does great work. I called him on a Thursday morning and he informed me he was near my home and he had an opening in his schedule that day, so he came out and gave me a quote. He had a cancellation late in the day and called to ask if I wanted him to stop by to perform the work and I said yes. Nate had to get on our roof that was 30 ft high but did not have a ladder that would reach that high. He quickly came up with a solution - renting a longer ladder from Home Depot so he could fix the shingles. When he completed all of the work he walked me through the house showing me what he did and asked me if it met my expectations. His work exceeded my expectations and I will be using him again for items in my new house."
5,"Nate arrived a little early. He called in advance to ask if it was OK to come a little earlier and let me know he was on his way. He was extremely polite and professional. He asked me several questions to make sure he would install the fans to my satisfaction. After he was done with the job he put everything back to where it was and cleaned up after himself. You would have never known he was here, let alone had done a repair job. I would definitely recommend him to any of my friends and I will hire him again in the future."
5,Very good and very efficient.
5,Great and professional
5,GREAT AS ALWAYS WHEN I CALE NATE.
5,Nate showed up on time and completed the installations in a timely manner and disposed of the old fans as well.
5,"Called Nate to see about getting a few things done around the house. He was able to stop by within a day to see exactly what I wanted done; texted me with a quote that same evening. Although he was booked for that week, and I expected we'd have to push to the next week or the week after that (which would have been fine with me - none of the jobs were critical), he was able to make it out late the week to perform the work. He arrived a little early and set to work. He patched two holes in the powder room. I had previously had a tolilet paper holder in the wall, but when I had someone install crown molding in that room, the installer stepped on the tp holder and broke it off from the wall. It was easier to remove the whole thing and patch the holes than to try to reinstall the tp holder arms. While the patch work was drying he began working on installing the cat door. This gave him a little bit of a fit and took more time than I think he anticipated. But I do think that was because of the quality/design of the cat door itself and had nothing to do with Nate's ability. I do think the job might have been a little easier if he had had clamps to hold both pieces to each side of the door, but apparently he didn't have any (and neither did I). In the end, he ended up adding an additional screw to the top of the cat door to make it a little more flush to the door (again, a quality/design issue with the cat door). It works perfectly fine, although after installation I did end up removing the flap as my cat didn't want anything to do with going in and out of the door with the flap on it. Without the flap he uses it just fine. And last but not least, Nate removed an existing light fixture and replaced it with a new one I had purchased. We had initally agreed on another job of removing an existing and installing a new over the range microwave, but after Nate had removed the old non-working one and taken the new one out of the box, we discovered the new one required venting to the outside of the house (for the range hood part), which is something I don't currently have. Nate was honest in that he didn't feel comfortable doing that type of work. So he repacked the new microwave and we called it a day. I am pleased with Nate's work. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him and to use his services again for any basic household repair. Additionally, I think is pricing is very, very fair."
5,Would highly recommend Nate. High quality work and a pleasure to deal with. Will use his services again.
5,"I loved the service that Nate provided, he came on the first day to install 2 light fixtures, he arrived right on time and installed one light fixture but the other I ended up picking the incorrect style for my ceiling, so he had to return a second occasion to put up the correct style, he arrived again right on time and his work was great, not only does he do fabulous work , but he cleaned up all the boxes, that was great! I will use Nate again and I have already told my neighbors about the good work he does. Thanks so much!"
5,"Nate showed up early (!!!). He was very conscientious and personable. Before the appoinment, we spoke on the phone. He asked me about the height of my ceilings in reference to whether he would need his ladder or not. He was sure to ask me if I was content with the work that he completed before he left. I am pleased with the work that he did. I actually decided at that point that I would like to use Nate for other work. So once he was finished, we walked through my home and went over my 'punch-list', in which I have several things about the house that need attention. Nate let me know what, if any materials it would take and also let me know an approximate time frame in which the work could be completed. I am happy that I chose Nate's Big Deal because now I have a ""Go-to Guy""! Thanks Nate!"
5,"Nate always returned my calls quickly. He was on-time for both the estimate and the work. He completed all the work in about 3 1/2 hrs. Nate went over all the jobs showing his completed work and even fixed a problem with the kitchen faucet that I didn't know I had.He vacuumed the rooms up after his work. I think that the price was reasonable for the work done. I can't speak highly enough of Nate. He is a hard-working,conscientious,younger guy who is looking to grow his small business through quality work at a reasonable price. Kudos,Nate!"
5,"Nate did a great job on the original work we hired him to do - he was courteous, punctual, hardworking and offered ideas that were helpful. We recently hired Nate again to handling our house closing punch list. Nate came out on very short notice due to our time constraints and worked extremely hard all day long and into the evening to get the list completed. I'm not sure we would have been able to meet our requirements without Nate's dedicated effort. He's a bright, hardworking guy that I would recommend to anyone."
5,"Nate was timely and professional. He went above and beyond the job, to help us remove a few large items from the house as well. I would definitely hire Updates by Nate again!"
5,"Nate was punctual and did a fantastic job. I needed two lights to be hung. Unfortunately, one of the lights was missing some of the pieces so he could only hang one of them on the first visit. Nate was very accommodating and actually came back for a second visit to install the second one. Overall, a great experience and I would use Nate again for services."
5,"Nate did a fantastic job on this project! The back patio area was a mess - dirty concrete, moldy fence, overgrown trees and dead bushes. When I got home I hardly recognized it after the work he had done. Working with Nate was a great experience from start to finish - he responded to my first call quickly, scheduled a time to meet with me soon after, provided a very reasonable fee quote on the same day, planned the time to do the project within the next week, and then arrived and completed everything as planned! Would definitely hire him again and recommend him to friends."
4,It went fine. There was an upgrade fee for the ceiling fan remote. I thought that it was a great deal. I would use them again.
5,"I purchased an Angie's List Big Deal for this service and it went well. He was very professional, did a great job and he is going to come back to install one more ceiling fan that I did not have parts for during the initial installation. I was very impressed. He was very kind and cleaned up after himself. He left no mess which I appreciated."
5,It was a good experience. I had several things for him to do and he accomplished everything in the allotted time frame in a professional courteous matter. I have used Nate's services before and plan to continue as my needs arise.
5,"He went above and beyond what I expected. He figured out how to install the fixtures not meant for the fans and fixed an existing problem caused by the original builder. Nate stayed longer than he expected, did more than he expected and added no more charge for the unexpected."
5,"We have done so much updating on our house for some reason we never followed through with some of the major lighting fixtures. That is, until we saw a special on Angie's List for two installations for $99. Always a bit nervous about hiring a handyman, because they're as hard to find as a good/honest mechanic. So, we checked out Nate on Angie's list and decided to take a chance and take advantage of the special. In the end, it turned out to be one of the best decisions we've made! Given the horrendous weather of late, Nate was running behind schedule on his other jobs, so he asked if he could work on a Sunday at no additional cost. Well, that certainly worked for us. He arrived exactly on time (actually 10 minutes early :-) )and went right to work. Very professional, knowledgeable/clean-cut and friendly. What also put our mind at ease was his pride in his workmanship. You pay per job only after it is completed and only after you are totally satisfied. Kind of funny, but on one of the fixtures, which was a challenge (we knew it would be), we were happy, but he wasn't and kept working until he was satisfied. In fact, so impressed were we by the finished product, in addition to the two fixtures on the special we had him install four more and do some repairs on our kitchen cabinet shelf. Again, we couldn't be happier with the outcome. So happy, we're having Nate return in a couple of weeks to do some major repairs on our backyard fence."
5,He arrived right on time. Installation was flawless. He made sure they were in the right spot and that the chandelier was hanging at the right height. He was very thorough in cleaning up. He even patched the holes from the previous fixtures. I will definitely call him for handyman services in the future.
5,It went great. He was very professional and paid a lot of attention to the detail of the work and the stability of the fans.
5,"Nate installed two ceiling fans in my house today. He arrived on time, was very polite, and did an excellent job at installing the two fans. One fan was installed on an angled ceiling using a down rod at about 14 feet high. I asked him several times if there was any additional charge for the angled ceiling and he said no each time, explaining that this was the quoted price. High integrity. He even came back after leaving when we called to say we could not figure out how to work the fan! Will definitely call him again for my ongoing house update projects."
5,"Nate responded extremely quick after I purchased the deal and scheduled the install for the following Monday (today). The original ceiling fan was installed in a non-standard manner, but Nate used his extensive home-improvement experience to persevere. The results are impressive! I plan on hiring Nate for other projects around the house and highly recommend his work!"
5,From start to finish my experience with Nate was great! You can tell he takes pride in what he does and his finished outcome proves it. He was on time and worked efficiently. He was very courteous and made sure I was happy with his work. His prices were also very reasonable. I would recommend Nate to my friends and family and will use Updates By Nate in the future.
5,"I have used Nate for handyman tasks in the past. He is courteous, fast, and dependable. He has done some painting, siding repair and carpentry work for me. His pricing is reasonable and I would recommend him."
5,Perfect. He was quick and neat.
5,Efficient and professional.
5,went very well and he was so nice
5,Nate did a great job!
5,All went very well
5,No problems. He knows his job.
5,The service went well

5,work was done perfectly.
5,Great no problems
5,Excellent!!!
5,Went well

5,Great
5,"FAST, PRECISE AND CLEAN."
5,He did an awesome job.
5,went well
5,See above. All went well.
5,Great
5,Absolutely great service.
5,Excellent job.
4,It was fine.
5,Great!
5,"I originally hired House Doctors to do a deep cleaning of a newly purchased home. They did an absolutely amazing job! I have hired them for regular cleaning services plus an occasional deep clean. I've been extremely happy with the service. They have been reliable, professional and accommodating. I've used their services now for several years and rely on them. Highly recommended!"
5,"I can't recommend House Doctors highly enough. Lori and her crew have been cleaning my house for three years and I've been 100% satisfied every time. They go out of their way to make sure your needs and requests are met and that includes fitting you into their busy schedule. I also want to mention that if you're moving or just packing things away to store in your home, House Doctors provides that service. Recently I moved and had House Doctors pack for me. This was something I couldn't handle on my own and they stepped in. Not one items was broken or chipped. Talk to Mike or Lori about the services they provide -- you won't be sorry."
5,"We love The House Doctors and use them whenever we have a home improvement project to do. Mike, the owner, is extremely responsive and really cares about the work his team does. Darrell handled the painting for all of the projects (he had done our front porch earlier, so we had confidence in his professionalism and work). We also had a large hole in the ceiling of a closet that they repaired superbly. It's like the hole didn't exist. Oh, and they installed a ceiling fan in our master bedroom with skill and ease. We can't say enough good things about the way House Doctors handles its business, and we have recommended them to friends. We recommend them to you as well."
5,"I was very much more than satisfied with all the work. They: Obtained all necessary supplies, did an excellent job matching the stain on the doors to the surrounding trim, showed up on time, were professional and polite and checked with me numerous times to see if I liked what they had done. The best thing I can say is that I WILL call them again for some additional projects I have in mind!"
1,The owner never called to schedule an appointment or called to inform me that he had chosen not to do the work.
1,"Overall I would say that the project started well, and much of the work is good quality. Mike started working for us back in late November, and its now April. He has basically quit the job with a lot of touchups still outstanding. Mike’s Crew (Daryl, Mark, and Matt) were constantly late, and rarely worked a full day. Their inability to show up at a reasonable time and stay more than 4 or 5 hours put the project multiple months behind. We also had to have them correct many things that they didn’t do well. Mike further has nickel and dimed us thousands of dollars for his own crew’s delays and mistakes. We have tons of texts, receipts, and more verifying this. We have security cameras all over the home that also document their hours. We’re trying to sell the home, but it’s not ready due to his inability to finish the job. We have to find another contractor to fix the poor drywall repairs to the ceiling in the family room, and touch up the kitchen cabinets they refinished. We will have to pursue legal action against Mike for incomplete work to recoup some of the costs. It’s absolutely absurd that we have had to deal with so many project delays, and that they’ve been unable to finish the drywall repairs to the ceiling. I’m completely shocked by such poor project management and the end result. We were trying to list the house for sale this month, but now have to endure further project delays to deal with the mess that Mike has left us. There’s literally so few things to finish. Besides actually fixing the drywall we spent thousands on, he still has to fix the cabinets his crew messed up, and complete a few small work items and touch ups. The cabinets do not shut properly and some are crooked. They also had to resurface them after spending weeks and leaving tons of flaws in the paint. A lot of the baseboards look bad because they didn’t caulk them. There’s countless paint touch ups. Etc. I really only think there’s a couple days worth of work for him to just send a competent crew out to fix. We’ve paid $25,000+ to Mike. It’s just sad how poorly this project has panned out. I have been helping my father update his home so it’ll sell quickly and for a profit. If Mike were just to actually finish the project we would be elated so we can just put this behind us."
1,I had rotted wood replaced on my garage and a shingle replaced on the house. After 5 months of replacement the shingle came off. I called the company 3 times and left messages to contact me. I received no response even though their tape message states they will contact you in 24hrs. I tried to e-mail to get a response and received none. Very unprofessional to not give any response to people they did work for. Beware they will respond to do work however if the work is not correct they will ignore you. I noticed on the 1 star reviews that are similar to mine the response is the same. That response is usually I have no records of the calls. I do have records of my calls and my e-mail so come up with another response because that one is getting old.
5,Mike Vecchio from The House Doctors is an absolute pleasure to work with. One of the few companies who actually came through with an estimate for a major rehab of my screened-in porch and other items. Mike's team (Mark and others) arrived when promised and worked on this job for several weeks until it was completed to my satisfaction. There were many facets to the job and the team was communicative throughout ensuring I was in agreement with everything they did. They even constructed a custom doggie door as part of the project! Reliable and trustworthy. I recommend The House Doctors.
5,"I originally started with looking at concrete platform steps which needed footers that proved too expensive. The House Doctors provided me with alternate options using treated lumber and backfilling with gravel. I am very grateful to Seth and Mike for working with me to understand the challenges, come up with alternate solutions, and work within my budget. An excellent solution that ended up saving me $5000.00"
4,"The foreman of our project did a good job and was responsive to our requests to get things done in a professional manner. The owner of House Doctors set appointments to finish up the project after we had paid and then his men didn't show. This happened more than once. After a final walk through we paid, as indicated but over the next several days we determined the additonal cost for repairs did not justify the quality we received. I requested a 2nd walk through with the owner to make adjustments but he did not get back with me. We finally worked things out with the company and overall are satisfied with the quality of the finished project."
1,"I reached out via Angie's List for a quote, included detailed description and pictures...no response. Called two separate numbers and left voicemails...no response. Believe it or not, I then sent a detailed email with pictures....a woman called an apologized for previous lack of response and an appointment was set....no show!!! After I had cleared furniture, draperies, etc. I called the same day, left message. A woman called me back a day later and left a voicemail, apologized and said contractor had Covid and they had to reschedule his appointments....FOUR strikes, they were definitely out! I did not return the call. I hired PatchMasters, also on Angie's list. They do not have any reviews, but they are a national company and after speaking with Joseph Gilliam, who sounded very sincere, I hired them and they did a great Job!."
3,Repair to drywall was excellent but window is still leaking.
5,"The project went very smoothly. Chris and Joe from the House Doctors were very prompt, courteous and competent. The remodel was completed ahead of schedule and looks beautiful. I'm looking forward to working on the next project with them."
5,fine. He also found damage to the bricks in the chimney and repaired those.
1,Horrendous from the get go. Initial appointment they came without any of the tools to do the range hood install. After waiting weeks for appointment they had to reschedule. Told me they'd come the next day only to call me after id taken off work to say no they need to reschedule. Wait several weeks again.. Called me day before the next appointment to say they have to reschedule again. Everytime they ask me about deck painting. I remind them its for a range hood install and fence staining. They are impossible to get a hold of and offer no help. With covid I realize delays happen but how can I trust they would do a good job when they don't even know what project they're supposed to be doing and can't even make a single appointment happen over a 2 month period. Would never use again.
5,"It was wonderful. The whole experience was very pleasant. The technician was polite and professional. He worked steadily the whole time he was here. He cleaned up after himself. He went out of his way for me because at the time I wasn't well. When we went to Home Depot to buy the supplies he went and brought me the handicapped shopping cart and taught me how to use it. At the end of the shopping he picked me up at the door. No swearing occurred. He also asked if there was anything else he could do for me so he did a few other small tasks that I couldn't do for myself at the time. So he did those for me as well. When I need work done for the house, The House Doctors are the people I call."
5,"Very quick, and did a really good job."
5,House Doctors did a really great job. Very happy.
5,"Seth was a delight to work with, personable yet professional. He explained the work and was very meticulous. Others were brought in to help with the list of tasks."
5,"Mike was a pleasure to talk to. His crew showed up on time and took seriously our pandemic-related concerns. The quality of the work met our needs. I liked that the crew leader suggested that they take care of a smaller issue in the basement while waiting for some of their work to dry, which would otherwise be down time for them. When the pandemic clears, we have a list of small projects that need to be done, and we will give The House Doctors another call at that time."
5,Great. Mike and Matt showed up on time. They were friendly and knew just what they were doing. They built a solid wood foundation and leveled it nicely. They told me when they arrived that some of these sheds are more time consuming to assemble than people might expect and got permission to stay longer if necessary. Turned out they got it all done very quickly and efficiently. It looks great. I've used House Doctors before for work inside my home and it went well so I was glad to call them back. Another very good job. I recommend them.
1,I suspect that the House doctor will show up at my house expecting his $165.00 service fee. Do I need to purchase the caulking prior? I just don't want any caulking I need something that will last. He never called me to discuss expectations or what has to be done. I am so frustrated. I do not know what to do. This is the worst experience I have ever had hiring a contractor.
5,"AMAZING! Great results, better than I hoped for! Seth is meticulous, professional and friendly! I couldn’t be happier!"
5,"Excellent , great communication. Did a great job."
1,"Contractor did not return my phone call/voicemail. Can not recommend when even a courtesy return call was not received. This was the first such repair I have had to make and had no direction. Was looking for guidance on repair, or at least materials, cost, etc."
5,Mark and Mike did an amazing job installing some bird guards on the outside of my bathroom vents. They were super nice and professional. Great sense of humor as well. I will be calling them for my future needs around the house.
5,It was great from start to finish. They worked in a professional and courteous manner. The quality of the work was excellent. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
5,"Excellent! Great communication, friendly, Did everything I asked. Hard workers. Perfect one stop shop for everything I needed to get done. Also they have deep cleaning service that is excellent. If you need help getting your house ready for sale, and/or cleaning I highly recommend House Doctors."
5,"I am so pleased with The House Doctors! They were super responsive via email, text, and phone during the entire process. They came out right away to give me a quote and outlined everything via email. They came out a few weeks later to complete the work and had two guys complete the project. The men estimated that the work would take 3 days and it only ended up taking two! I had a relatively complicated project and had asked The House Doctors to move my laundry room from the basement up to my second floor. My house is over 100 years old, so I wasn't sure what to expect. This project required them to move electric and water lines through two floors of my house. I had 5+ companies actually come out and give me a quote, each had a very different idea on how to complete the project. The House Doctors had the easiest answer on how to get the work done with the least amount of work and their pricing was very reasonable. The two workers were so friendly, knowledgeable, patient (they answered all of my questions and took time to explain things to me), and prompt. I am amazed that they also left all of the spaces where they worked cleaner than when they arrived (they swept and vacuumed after each day). I will absolutely work with The House Doctors again for projects around my house."
1,"Terrible, they gave me a time frame never showed, never called!"
5,"Fantastic! My Mother was prepared with sheets to drape over the furniture and was planning on having a cleaning done afterwards. None of that was necessary because the crew covered every inch of the room with plastic sheeting. We were forewarned that it might be difficult to blend the patch with the rest of the ceiling, but ultimately it looks fantastic. We also had the crew examine the attic space above to see if there was a possibility of another, future leak, and they were kind enough to do so. My hope now is that the crew from the condo association did an equally good job repairing the roof on the outside as the House Doctors did repairing the ceiling on the inside!"
5,Very well. Brian was punctual. Clean. Professional and I sat with him while he worked and I was asking him questions and he was very polite and answered all my questions. I felt we knew each other for awhile. Definitely would hire him again and a matter of fact I already called him again
5,Our experience has been fantastic! Our elderly mother needed help with housekeeping and Lori has been amazing. She and Mom have developed a great relationship and Lori has been more than flexible with the schedule. We are very pleased with our experience!
5,Lori and Dawn arrived exactly on time. They quickly got to work and the house sparkled when they were done. Both Ladies were extremely professional and friendly. I am thrilled that I decided to hire the House Doctors for my house cleaning. Best decision that I have made in a while. I highly recommend the House Doctors.
5,Besides $375 for a one man job that took an hour- I’m relieved because two separate 2-man crews from Home Depot could not and would not try to complete it. It sounds ridiculous after watching and seeing a working micro wave that it was such a process but the House Doctors saved the day! I will definitely call them again for our next handyman project. Super nice guy & I was super comfortable to have him in my home with a newborn. He called the day before to confirm and when he arrived in my driveway.
1,"DID NOT EVEN SHOW UP FOR THE QUOTE OR CONTACT US TO LET US KNOW THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO MAKE IT. IF SHOWING UP FOR A QUOTE IS A TOUGH JOB, I CAN'T IMAGINE THEIR WORKMANSHIP..."
5,"Mike and his crew did a really good job with the work that was done in my home. When Mike came to my house to give me an estimate for the work to be done, as I was talking to him about the things that I wanted repaired and the work to be done, I was very impressed with his wealth of knowledge and as the homeowner, I really appreciated the fact that Mike explained to me in detail what they would need to do for the repairs for the things that needed to be fixed. After his crew completed the work, the work they did looked really good and you could tell that the work was professionally done. They also completed the work in a timely manner. There were just a few minor things that I wanted to be touched up afterwards and Mike was great with following up on those. When I brought them to Mike’s attention, he followed up with me on the same day and he took care of them in a timely manner (he scheduled a date/time to do the touch ups). Mike and his crew were also very nice, and pleasant to work with. I will use The House Doctors for future work to be done in my home because they do work that’s quality, and looks good as well as looks professionally done."
1,I received an initial call in response to my request for a quote through Angie's List. No one showed up to the scheduled appointment. I have since left two voicemails over the past week to follow up and reschedule but have not received a return phone call.
5,I will hire them again. They were professional and they did a thorough job. They brought their own cleaning supplies and they did what I asked them to do.
5,"Lori and Dawn have now cleaned twice for me and do a fantastic job! The house just sparkles and smells so nice and clean when I get home. They let me know when they arrive, when they leave and are very pet friendly. I love that they will wash windows and pay attention to small details like my makeup mirror, even wiping down the refrigerator or sweeping off the deck if I ask. Great decision to make a move to House Doctors."
4,They were very responsive to me for my having contacting.
5,"Mark did a great job replacing the water-damaged floor of our sink cabinet. ETA was 9:30-11:30 am. He came at 10:00 and was done in 3 hours, including a trip to Home Depot for supplies. Great work! We are going to have The House Doctors do our whole list of repairs we've been putting off for years."
5,"In preparation for listing my home I had a laundry list of small things to complete. At this point I was already out of town at my new job and wasn’t able to work on these things myself. Mike and his wife Lori did a great job dealing with things like ceiling and trim painting, carpentry, and an entire deep cleaning including windows. They responded quickly, dealt with my hectic schedule, and got the work done in time to list. Thanks to the great final touches they put on the house I received two offers during the first open house."
5,They are doing an excellent job including working around my very difficult schedule.
5,Lori and Dawn have AMAZED me once again with professionalism.. These girls come prepared for work.. Always so polite and ready to get the job done. My house looks and smells amazing!! Thank you! So excited recommend them to my friends and family..
5,The girls (Lori and Dawn) were AWESOME! They were very professional and thorough... They were extremely polite.. I will definitely be using their services again and again!! And will be recommending them to my family and friends..
2,"Called to schedule estimate. Lauri was nice and responsive. The day of the estimate Mike was running late. He was very nice when he showed up. I showed him different things like carpentry, the kitchen ceiling, and some plumbing. We discussed what he would do. He said he'd give me my estimate to me via email, I didn't receive my quote. I called the office and Lauri said she will have him call me. Weeks later he called me, but he told me he was very busy and he was primary care giver for his sick father. He said he would send it the following weekend. Weeks went by I never heard anything, so I called back saying that I didn't get the estimate and that I'm anxious to get this work done. ***UPDATE (6/4/19): I received a message from the service provider last night about the estimate but was unable to answer. Of course, I didn't hear back from him until I posted this review. He said on the message that he sent the estimate the following day after I spoke with Lauri and that he was waiting to hear from me. Yet I got a phone call from him weeks later about his father and he apologized saying his father is ill and he's backed up but that he would send the estimate the following weekend. Why would he say to me that he sent it right after I contacted his wife about it when I didn't hear from him weeks after that. The story about the estimate doesn't add up. I even called him after saying that I didn't get the estimate the second time he would send it to me. Due to this I left him a message this morning advising that I have moved on and have found other contractors. It’s unfortunate that we couldn't get and work together, but I've moved on now."
2,"Once I was contacted , an appointment was set . They were a no call no show , and didn't return my calls after the fact"
5,"House Doctors have been cleaning my house for a little over a year and they are wonderful. Lori and her crew are always on time, bring their own supplies and equipment, and make my home sparkle. They are pleasant, efficient, and will do whatever needs to be done. I'd had doubts about hiring a cleaning service and now wonder how I managed without House Doctors. If it was possible to give an A+, I would do it in a heartbeat."
5,"Until recently, I have always cleaned my own house but I've just become too busy to keep up with baseboards, windows and deep cleaning. Thank goodness for Lori and Dawn! They are professional, conscientious and genuinely nice to be around. They really seem to enjoy cleaning and our house sparkles when they leave. They're always on time and work very efficiently. They bring their own cleaning products and equipment but they will use your vacuum and products if you prefer. Lori always seems to fit me into their schedule when I need them and I'm really grateful for their help. Prices are very reasonable too. I have always had very good experiences with the House Doctors!"
5,I love them!!!! They are thorough and professional and made me feel as if I was their most important client! Their work is superb! I highly recommend them!!!
5,Fine. Very satisfied. They are hard workers.
5,Everything was left clean and in order. The people are very friendly. I was very pleased and would hire this company again.
5,Jim did an excellent job successfully completing a long list of home repairs in a professional and timely manner. He gave accurate time expectations and suggested better options for solving lighting issues. We would defiantly hire House Doctors again!
5,"I have been extremely pleased with this company! I had initially hired the company for a deep clean. The work was done so well that I went back to them for a regular biweekly service (approx. 2,800 sq. ft with a pet). The ladies are very pleasant, reliable and thorough. On the occasions that I've been home, I've noticed that they NEVER stop working! I'm thrilled to have found such a good cleaning service and can give an honest Excellant AAAAA review since my house is always spotless after their work."
5,"Super! I had hired House Doctors late summer 2018 to help at my son's family home after they'd gone through serious illness and been overwhelmed. That job had gone SO well (see my prior review), I recently asked my son if they'd like to have that happen again. They would, indeed! And so once again, we are 100% pleased with every aspect of this housecleaning service. I/we would hire them again in a heartbeat. Courteous, professional, thorough, caring, efficient are but a few of the accolades that fit. Thank you so much, Lori and Gail!"
5,All the guys who participated were friendly and professional. They showed respect for our home. They communicated with us on any changes needed but also listened to our input. Pricing was very reasonable for the job. I will use them again!
3,"I contacted this company requesting a deep house cleaning. They were prompt in responding and setting up an appointment. The price seemed reasonable -for a deep clean- and the two women showed up when promised. In the initial text conversation I was instructed to make a list of everything I needed done, which I did create. One of the women reviewed the list multiple times throughout their time here but somehow managed to miss approximately 50% of what was listed. Most of the half that was actually completed was decent work but not a “deep clean” by any standards. Some shelves of a few different units were dusted; remaining shelves of the same unit were untouched. One of the women stood on our coffee table to dust a ceiling fan even though they brought a step stool. They forgot their vacuum so they asked to use ours, which was no problem but they only used it in 2 small areas. One of the women told us that it didn’t take much time because the house was not dirty but then I overheard the other say (unprompted) “We are house cleaners, not miracle workers.” If my house needed a miracle to be clean then why did the job take two hours? I would have been happy to pay for more time if the things I asked for had been done. We won’t be using or recommending this companyin the future."
5,"House Doctors performed quality work for a very reasonable price. The wok was completed efficiently and all area’s left clear. I ha Ltd a challenge finding a contractor to complete these small jobs, but Mike came out and assured me that they could get it done. Mike came out to review the work completed by his employee (Mark who was very good at his work), and ensured everything was completed to y satisfaction before I had to settle the bill. I would hire them again for any project I have in the future."
2,"I want to be clear that the job was done well, the person showed up on time and the person who did the work was very professional. However, what happened AFTER is the problem. SInce I wanted to pay by credit card, the workman told me he would have the office contact me to pay the bill. Long story short: I was literally chasing this company down, for nearly a month, to pay for the service rendered. They told me they would call repeatedly, then did not. I could have lived with that but, when I did finally reach them to pay the bill, I wanted to schedule an estimate to get a ceiling repaired. I was put on their schedule, and that time came and went, with no phone call or appearance of anyone. Needless to say, I hired another company and would recommend that anyone dealing with this one be very cautious."
5,"It was a big change from dark navy to creamy off white, and they did an amazing job. They arrived right on time. They helped rehang the curtain rods and did a lot above and beyond what I would have expected. I will recommend them to friends and family."
4,Mike and his workers did a great job. It seemed as though the ball was dropped by the front office. I needed to call multiple times and the lady on the phone was pleasant but seemed a little disorganized. Overall they did a great job and I would hire again.
5,"Courteous and prompt service in all the work throughout the year. Exelent attention to detail, and reponds promptly to manage the high quality of work."
5,"Mike and his team arrived promptly on the day of service and were friendly and professional. The work was completed and Mike left, but after seeing some pictures later in the day my fiancee wanted some changes made. Mike made time to come back out the same evening to do the additional work and was still very friendly. The banister looks great and is well built, and we are very happy with it and Mike's professionalism. I recommend House Doctors and will be using Mike's services again in the future."
5,"It was good. It was excellent service. They were nice, they were pleasant. Bill is very very nice person. The way he talked and treated me. I do like the way it turned out. I would hire them again."
5,Crew arrived at appointed time and all projects completed. Very satisfied. We will certainly use them again for any other repair needs.
5,I was super impressed with the timeliness and ability to ask questions to help with project. I was told what exact door I needed to order and dimensions which made the decision easy for someone like me who doesn’t have time or skill to do these type projects. The door removal was complicated due to how the previous door was put in by former owner. The project took 6 hours due to it and I know that it was beyond what he estimated. I offered to pay extra for the time and work that went into it and mike declined. I would hire them for my next project. I hesitated to write that part cause I know it helps business but don’t want them to be (selfishly ) too busy for me. Lol
5,"Good work done. Looks good and was completed quickly once started. Cleanup was very good. Communication could have been a little better, but overall was good."
5,Wonderful. Mike is a very friendly guy and he basically helped me to feel less stressed about getting all this work done on the house in order to sell it. He did everything I needed done and a great job. I would definitely hire him admin!
5,"Very well. As always, the work was done as we were told it would be. Mike & his crew were professional, answered our questions, and completed the jobs in a timely manner. We were pleased with everything."
5,Excellent - The house doctors were professional & did a thorough job.
5,"Excellent! Workers were polite, professional & successfully completed my project. I will be using their service for future projects."
5,I call these guys when ever I need anything from a chandelier hung to a floor replaced. They are now my first call. Love them!
5,"Well, will be using them in the near future..."
5,Mark was great! I would definitely have him again. Very pleased with how my door turned out.
4,"Accomplished promptly and professionally. I wanted to ask about something, but they left before I could do so."
1,"This went horribly. They first contacted me two days after I submitted my project need to Angie's List. That should have been my first sign of trouble. I then described my issue in detail to the woman who sets up the appointments for Mike and we agreed they would come to my house on October 12th between 2 - 3 p.m. to look at project and quote it. I told her this was an urgent matter as we can't currently use that bathroom because of the leak. She assured me they could work quickly. October 12th came and at 3:36 p.m. I received a call saying they couldn't make it out during the window because of another job. No kidding, it was already past the time they agreed to show up. She then said they would come later that evening between 6 - 7 p.m. Of course they didn't come and said they would definitely come on Sunday (two days later between 3 - 4 p.m.). At this point, I wasn't confident if they would ever show up. Mike did ultimately show up to my house 5 minutes before 4 p.m. My father let him in to explain the issue. Mike looked at the issue and said they don't do plumbing and left. So after wasting two weeks of my time and missing two scheduled appointments, they ultimately said they couldn't do the work. Why couldn't they tell me that when I FIRST described the issue? This was the worst experience ever! Perhaps he is good at his job, but their customer service was terrible. Will never call again!"
5,"Mike was attentive to our needs and answered all of our questions. Various members of Mike's crew performed different parts of the repairs & painting. ALL members of Mike's crew were courtesy & professional. Based upon our positive experience, we decided to hire Mike & his crew for additional services."
4,"Mike was very nice, professional. Was there when he said he would and did a ice job"
5,"Fantastic! This was for my son & daughter-in-law's home in another city (where House Doctors is) and they were *wonderful* to deal with, both by phone and in person. Great job--everybody's SO happy! Even the young kids, arriving home from school, went wide-eyed, saying, ""Whoa! This is super!!"" Not that anything was terrible before but health issues had prevented normal levels of cleaning for some time and House Doctors' housecleaning took everything over the top. Kudos! The price was right for two people / three hours and I would hire again in a heartbeat if the occasion arises."
5,"Amazingly well! Very pleased! I hired this company to clean, freshen and organize my son's family home after they'd faced many months of very serious illness. I live in Florida but my son's family is in my home city, so I am familiar with suburban locations there. This company was courteous and kind, helpful to the Nth degree, efficient and thorough. Their pricing was appropriate, in my opinion, and I would hire them again in a heartbeat should the need arise again. They cleaned a three-level residence (3 bedrooms/2 baths - top floor; kitchen/dining room/playroom/living room/2 bedrooms/1 bath - main floor; rec room/bar area/laundry - lowest level). Two people for approx 4 hours, as agreed. Son and family thrilled. As am I. And I want to apologize for being so long delayed in writing this up."
5,"They were professional, friendly, polite and thorough. When done, it looked like a new room. They left everything spotless."
5,I’m very happy with the job the House Doctors did for me. We started taking wallpaper down from a bedroom and realized it was too large of a project for us to do DIY. The walls needed repairs and the rest of the wallpaper needed to be removed. Mike was very professional. He gave me a quote and started a few weeks later. It took one week to complete just as promised. And final payment was about the quoted price. I’m now going to get another quote for a bathroom remodeling.
5,The crew was both professional and friendly. They also kept us informed when they found something unexpected. I would say it went very well. These guys worked very hard and definitely know their craft.
5,Went well. The deck and front steps look very nice. They matched the stain perfectly on both.
5,Work went smoothly over several days. Very good attention to detail.
5,"The only reason for the 'B' in responsiveness is that there was a miscue between their office and the owner as to the appointment date and time. Date we were given was 6/26. The owner had our appointment for 6/27, so we waited all day on 6/26 for nothing. Now, the owner (Mike) did call us the evening of 6/26 and apologized profusely for the error. He had two young men come out on 6/27 and they were very nice, respectful, and hard working. They did a great job, even in the rain. I would very much recommend The House Doctors."
5,"Everything went well as promised. The crew had to replace rotten wood on the porch pillars, and we suggested that they replace damaged lattice before painting. Mike added in the extra work but kept the cost affordable. I have been dealing with the house doctors for at least 10 years. I will continue to use their services, and recommend them to anyone, who wants to deal with an honest company that does quality work."
5,They were very professional they showed up on time my porch looks beautiful all of my neighbors are giving me compliments on my yard I would say it went great.
4,"They did a good job, but got confused about the address and so missed the first appointment. Had to reschedule."
5,"Excellent. High quality work, all requested details addressed, crew was easy to work with, good communications, all work done in a very timely manner."
5,I am very happy with the results. The porch looks beautiful. Jim did a good job.
5,"The owner’s wife is an angel! She was extremely accommodating even though I contacted them with an urgent short time frame, they made it happen! My daughter’s room was perfectly painted with paint to spare. I would have given THD all A’s but the painter who arrived at my home was not very friendly when I spoke to him on the phone. He was slightly arrogant. With that being said, he did an awesome job with no mess. At the end of the day, I got what I paid for. The owner’s wife friendly disposition and great customer service made up for my interaction with the painter. Maybe he was having a bad day? I would definitely hire them again."
5,We had a playground and basketball hoop installed poorly by another company. Mike and his team came and fixed the area to make it safe and look beautiful. They added playground mulch and framed out the area nicely. We are very happy with the work!
5,"There was a laundry list of small to moderate repairs needed for point-of-sale inspection plus a little drywall refinishing from a recent plumbing issue. Mike and the crew at The House Doctors handled scheduling with both tenants, all supplies and materials, and completed the repairs pretty quickly. The price was a bit higher than I was hoping, but to have someone who could handle all the aspects of the job (painting, windows, small electrical, minor masonry, downspout, siding, pressure washing) was very convenient."
5,"The project went well. It turns out that there was more work involved than initially scoped and Mike was fair about the price of that work. His quote was detailed, clear and complete. He was very responsive and helpful. His staffperson made sure to clean up after the project and was very friendly. The only reason that we rated a B on price was that it wasn't the least expensive proposal on the table, but it was worth paying extra to make sure the job was done correctly."
5,"When the tiles in my 1952 Bungalow home starting crumbling off the shower walls, I attempted to correct the situation with a DIY surround. Finally the surround started to show tears and mold (see ugly ""before"" photos) and I got estimates for a partial and full bath remodel. I happened upon The House Doctors and they completely transformed the room. I could not afford to remodel everything at once, so they accommodated my budget by completing the project in 2 phases, something other companies would not do. The room is beautiful and, just as importantly, the shower is now safe for my elderly mother to use (see after photos)."
5,"Very well. Lori and Kim were very pleasant and professional, and did a thorough job. They brought their own supplies. My furniture and mirrors shine, and the bathrooms are so clean and smell so good."
5,Did a great job on soffit which was very high up on very tall house blended repair in perfectly with existing molding to the point you wouldn’t know it was repaired unless you knew it was rotted. Repaired bed room ceiling and Spanish style plaster work perfectly and repainted so you would never know it was not original ceiling.
5,The service was exceptional at every level. Lori worked with me to re-schedule when the mailbox was not delivered on time. The gentleman who assembled and installed the mailbox did a great job. I’m very pleased.
5,This was my first experience with a professional house cleaning service and it was fantastic. Everything was done to perfection. I'll be calling House Doctors again and have already recommended them to several friends.
5,"Very well. Was a big job, in that it was customized for us. The entire bathroom had to be changed, to make it accessible for a walker. It is beautiful and functional. Everything we requested was done. Chris and Pat were always pleasant and professional, and kept us informed of any changes. They were helpful and made good suggestions."
5,"Lori and Erin are true professionals. They got right to work and stuck to their tasks. When they were done, everything sparkled and was as clean as a whistle! They saved me much time and labor. I am completely satisfied. I for sure would hire them again. And I will also recommend them to others."
3,"My provider was limited for time because I had a doctor's appointment, but the work that was done was not thorough. My bedroom was supposedly cleaned, however, the large closet floor was never done and the window sills were also not cleaned - I had to remind her. She cleaned the bathroom but neglected to clean the fixtures in the shower. I would have assumed she would know what to do. She did leave a follow-up call to complete the amount of time paid for, but I have had some medical problems and did not call her back - yet."
5,It went well. Jobs were finished up as quickly as possible. In some cases workers even stayed late to beat the weather coming in.
5,"Mark was very prompt and professional, and the new sills looked great. Would definitely hire them again."
4,We we're ecstatic that this could be done at such a reasonable cost. The workmanship was top-notch. Very pleased with our contractor.
2,The roof repair estimation is twice of another company. When I told the Representative the next day when she called. She hung up the phone on me while I was talking. Won't recommend to anybody in the future.
5,Jim did a beautiful job. I am happy I had the work done. Porch looks great.
5,"A gentleman from The House Doctors came out and, luckily, the problem was not extensive and within a few hours he was able to cut away the damaged wood trim, determine the wood underneath was fine, and the repair was very well done at a reasonable price. We are having The House Doctors return soon to install a handrail on the ""modern"" style stairs to our basement that have no rail, repair 2 doorknobs, and clean our gutters."
5,Good. the ladies were nice and worked efficiently. I have so much more to be done and it was nice to have them give me a break. Thank you!
5,"Great. Mark was punctual, worked efficiently and was knowledgeable in all areas of work performed."
5,Good communication! Very personable! Job completed in a timely manner! Complete clean up! Thank You.
5,"As usual with this company. The work is excellent, the clean up perfect, the staff polite."
5,"Very satisfied with results of the work as well as interactions with the House Doctors on bid, scheduling and job completion. Jim had excellent work ethic, was timely, efficient, easy to work with and did an excellent job."
5,Mike came right away to give us an estimate and was able to complete the work within a week. Very pleased.
5,I am relieved to have this work done
3,"No work was performed as no quote was received. I can't actually say if I would hire them again because I did not hire them a first time. I have nothing on which to base a review of their work, only their responsiveness and professionalism."
1,"A contractor from this company came to my home to do an estimate for the repairs covered by my homeowners insurance. After that, I haven't heard from them. My calls & emails were not returned. Have ended up hiring someone else. Am not going to call this company ever again and don't recommend."
5,"Had to work around the weather, but they stayed in contact and scheduling was not a problem. Very happy with outcome. It looks good, provider was professional and pleasant, worked well and took care of everything."
5,"The team did a fantastic job cleaning the house. They were friendly, hard working and willing to work around a contractor that was running behind. I highly recommend them for your cleaning needs."
1,"called left message, never received a call back"
5,The repairs were done very professionally
5,"This was a wood rot coupon appointment. I was glad that this company hung in there with me through a few obstacles. One was that my presence was sporadic due to a pressing family illness. The other was that we had to interrupt work a couple of times to eradicate yellow jacket nests. At the end though, I now have three solid windows, painted and well sealed. Thank you House Doctors."
4,"When I fist bought the coupon, a nice lady called to schedule but I was not yet ready. She called another time and I needed to get back to her. Then I called several times and could not get through, left messages. They did finally call back and we are all set up now."
5,"Great, the guy did a good job!! It was mostly for safety. I feel better that it’s fixed."
5,They were very professional and responded to my request for additional work.
5,"Great job by Mark. Punctual, polite, professional."
5,"Showed up right on time, tarped up the whole area, got right to work. When he left, everything was meticulously cleaned (given that it was drywall repair, that's not a joke!). Very happy about the job."
4,Okay. Contractor didn’t bring enough supplies and had to leave to pick up more.
5,"Arrived on time, got right to work. If you hire them, make sure you have a long list. They work fast and it is surprising how much can be done."
1,"Awful. We called repeatedly to set up the service. They never called us back. The last time we called, the number was for ""Perfect Power Wash."" They have our money and we have nothing."
3,"For some reason he completed just a portion of the job and neglected to finish it 100%, which I discovered when I arrived home (it was an outside task). I just prorated the payment to him to be done with it."
5,"Mark and Jim did an excellant job. They answered all questions, moved and protected furniture, cleaned up, took me to purchase material, arrived on time and worked really hard to get the job done."
5,Very well. Very nice ladies and they work very hard.
1,"Was contacted immediately via email and an appointment was scheduled for three weeks later. Estimates were to be emailed, but were not received despite several messages left at both office and cell numbers. After Angie's List reimbursed the amount paid for the original tuck pointing deal, a proposal without detail was finally received (actually one month to the date of the original appointment). The proposal was declined via email and work was completed by another contractor."
5,Job was done exactly as Mike said it would be.
5,"Very well. Everything was completed properly--floors, bathrooms, kitchen, living and dining room."
4,Did everything I wanted him to. Only hiccup was he was sent to my old address instead of the new address where the work was to be performed.
5,"He was on time, called ahead and told us what we needed. Excellent work."
5,"Outstanding quality workmanship from The House Doctors two man team, very prompt, professional, courteous, and timely execution and the crew paid attention to very detail of the job."
5,Very efficient and job looked great when completed...needed a deck of my sliding glass doors to the outside in the backyard...they built it stained and painted it and we are very pleased with the outcome.
5,Great! They determined and solved the problem.
3,They came out inspected the deck and furniture and said the washing wouldn't do any damage however after the job was done there was few spots on the deck where the stain had been removed exposing the wood. Overall they got the job done so i cant complain.
5,"Jim assessed the problem, explained what needed to be done and what materials were needed. He worked within the contracted time and completed the work with neatness and precision."
5,"They were on-time, courteous and professional. Did a great job! I'll definitely hire again."
5,"Great, l had final approval on all completed repairs. Good to find a company that would handle small jobs."
3,women was very nice but had to re-schedule on me last minute 2 different times. She finally showed up on our 3rd appointment. I asked her to only focus on a couple select rooms and just do a deep cleaning on those but it was very surface level.
1,"The contractor was 45 minutes late; Instead of repairing the wall he decided to cover it with 1/4 inch drywall. But he said I had to buy the drywall, screws, and spackling before he could start. I had planned to let him into the house and then go to work for a few hours. Instead we drove to Home Depot where I bought two sheets of drywall, a 5-gallon bucket of mud, and a box of drywall screws. Then I helped him load his truck which wasn't big enough for the drywall so both sheets got damaged when he squished the sheets into his truck. His work looks ok but he took the leftover screws and the 5-gallon bucket of mud (it was probably 75% full when he was done)."
5,"The carpenter/handyman work, excellent Confusion at the office."
5,"Came to the house, measured for wood trim. Bought trim & installed. Did nice job on trim & door."
1,I made an appointment with House Doctors for 8/14/2017. They never showed up to complete the job. I left two messages with them on 8/14/2017 about not showing up. They have made no attempt to contact me about the job that I hired them to complete in my home.
2,"I purchased a deal on Angie's and never was contacted by the company. I submitted the Angie's List scheduling request form, emailed their direct email address and called and left a message. After a month of no contact back, I asked Angie's List for a refund."
5,"I hired “The House Doctors” for the wood rot package. I thought there was going to be a problem as no one showed up at the arranged time, and no one called. After I called in twice, Jim, the man who was actually going to do the work called, and explained that his co-worker had had an emergency. I was pleased to hear that he could come later that day! I thought it was a bit odd that the office never call to explain, or apologize for the inconvenience but had their pro call, and no follow up call either. Thus the lower grade on “professionalism”. Their pro, Jim was great! He did a nice job (and I am somewhat picky), and he was quick. He accomplished more than I thought he would in the four hours allotted. I really appreciate, too, that he deferred from any finish work, as that is not in his wheelhouse, rather than hack his way through those. Halelujah!"
5,"They did an excellent job, even adding a few extra touches here and there (i.e. paid to paint upstairs shutters but also painted downstairs shutters to match, made slight changes to back deck at my request with no added cost.) The workers were friendly but focused; they worked hard from the time they arrived (between 10:30am and 11:30 am) till the time they left at the end of the day (usually 5:30ish pm but once as late as 7:30ish pm). Their workmanship was superb. I am definitely happy with this company. I will definitely hire House Doctors again for any work on the house we may need in the future."
5,Very detail oriented & professional
5,They did a very good job and cleaned up everything. The guys were really courteous and communicated their progress throughout the four days it took to complete . Most of the contract details were communicated by email and they were always timely getting back to me with any answers or changes I requested. Pricing was slightly higher then quoted prices I received but the quality of work more than made up for that and they were willing to work with me a little.
5,"Great, he was professional and courteous."
5,"Two ladies, and came to clean our apartment. They worked very well together and were very organized. They mopped, vacuumed, dusted, clean the ceiling fans, and whatever else needed done. They used a Dyson vacuum cleaner which was very highly rated on consumer reports. I am planning to use them again. They are scheduled to come July 29. r"
1,Took 2 weeks of missed and not responded t messaging to finally schedule appointment for cleaning. They didn't show nor call.
1,"I bought the $ 149 wood restoration deal on July 31st, scheduled the work for August 30th. They didn't show up the day of the appointment and didn't call to cancel or to apologize. I called the company twice, left messages and they never called me back. The worst is that Angie's List doesn't want to refund the money because is past 30 days even though is not my fault. The work was scheduled 30 days after I bought the deal because of their availability."
5,"Work was done as agreed. Wood was replaced and all areas cleaned up. Four hours was the original deal, wood rot only took about an hour, so he readily offered to do other work. Tightened stair rail and even got out onto roof of porch, and caulked sky light window that was dripping with hard rain. VERY professional, helpful and didn't make me feel stupid (which is important to me!) Thank you Angie's List for helping me find this great company. I would definitely use this company again."
5,"Punctual, professional, efficient. Also responsive to my specific needs."
4,It took forever to contact them and get a response. They came one day to look at it and told me they would have it done within 3 weeks. They actually came the next day and performed the work.
1,"Their discounted prices are reflected of the service. I will not work with this firm in the future, because of a complete lack of professionalism, an inability to answer the phone or respond in a timely fashion to a call or email, and for not showing up to an appointment. They wasted my time and I assure you will have no problem doing the same to yours. I would stay away at all costs, even if pricing is slightly more expensive at another provider. It was one of the single worst customer service experiences I have had to deal with outside of the airlines or Time Warner Cable. There are two phone numbers that are consistently not manned by a customer service representative, making it nearly impossible to get things done punctual or professionally. To schedule the appointment I left several messages via email and over the phone before I received a call back -- which came after 8:30PM when I was not available. I called back first thing in the morning and didn't receive a follow-up call until the following week. When we setup a time to conduct the work the window of arrival was between 9:30-11:30. I was unable to contact the company the morning of to confirm service times or narrow the window. I waited the 2 hours and no one showed up to the property. I tried to call to see if they were on their way or if I needed to reschedule, but again was unable to reach anyone at the firm."
5,Clean up was done well.Both contractors did good work kept things neat do during their work.They did not rush their work therefore quality was good.
1,No one showed up on scheduled appointment day.
5,Very well. The workers were not rushed but performed their tasks thoughtfully and thoroughly. I was particularly pleased that a few extras not included in the original quote were done to finish the job. I had not made a request for the extras but was thrilled to see that Jim had taken the initiative make the finished product look great. Mike the owner was responsive and communicated effectively. I would hire them again.
5,"The person arrived within the time frame we were told. (I can't remember his name) I asked him if he could take a photo of the damage so we could see what it looked like. He took his cell phone and took a photo of it. Once he started the job, he kept us informed of any issues he ran into. He was very friendly and helpful. I would use them again."
1,"When they initially contacted me after purchase I was told they didn't have any openings for 3 weeks and I scheduled that. The week of the appointment they called on Mon to cancel the Wed appointment because they said it might rain (it didn't). They re-scheduled for the next week (now 4 weeks since purchase). On the day of the appointment no one showed up and no one called. After I called and left messages they called to re-schedule and said they didn't have any appointments for 4 more weeks (that would be 8 weeks after purchase), I said that was unacceptable, they said they would call back and I never heard from them."
1,"The process started out well. House Doctors came highly recommended, and I knew they could do all of the work I needed. I met with Mike who took good notes and talked through the job, and seemed interested in the job. Unfortunately Mike never provided an estimate despite a followup phone call. I was unable to proceed with this company."
5,"Mark was conscientious, took 2 hours, cleaned up."
5,It went very well! No problems since then.
5,I was very happy with the results and will use them again and recommend them.
5,The plumber that I had worked with for many years from this company was not available. The plumber they sent out was good we just had a little problem getting dates and times set. The plumber was very knowledge and worked hard to get to the root of the problem and well as providing advice as to what is need in the future to prevent this problem .
5,Mark was great!! Worked efficiently and did a nice job
2,They came to your house without any kind of identification. They did not clean up after. It wasn't the best of jobs.
5,"Mike, the owner, was prompt in providing an estimate. He offered suggestions which would enhance the work we wanted done so we agreed to include that. They were able to schedule us quickly because of a cancellation and Mark and Jim arrived on time, even earlier than promised, which worked out well for us. They installed two new handrails with backboards for each on the walls of both stairwells. They stained the one to the second floor with a stain which matched the sashes on our windows. Additionally, they painted the walls and ceiling going from first to second floor. At my request they left the backboards and rails to the basement unfinished. They repaired drywall in first floor bathroom and painted the walls. Then installed the decorative grab bar. We found the quality of their work to be excellent."
5,"The crew was open to communication and feedback. They helped solve some problems, such as unexpected chipping due to uneven cabinets. They were cheerful and professional. I would use them for the whole house if I had the money."
1,"Called and set up an appointment. On the day they were to come out, no one showed. Called both the 440 and 216 numbers shown in their ad to ask if they were going to be late, or if they wanted to reschedule another day. Got voice mail at both numbers and left messages. It's been two weeks and still no response. By some of the reviews, I would have to guess that they do good work when they show up, but a quality provider should be based on more than just the work performed. Professionalism is also measured by courtesy, dependability and consistently."
5,Great. I am also getting estimates on future projects as I would hire them again!
5,The House Doctors cleaners showed up on time (2 for 1.5 hrs) and did an excellent job of refreshing the house -- it smelled great after they left! I would definitely hire them again.
5,"excellent job, fast and thorough, pleasant and friendly."
3,1st guy was done by a guy who was full of confidence but left pieces of glass everywhere on the ground. We didn't see it at 1st because dry leaves were all over the ground but there were shards of glass everywhere- very dangerous. The 2nd window was done weeks later by another guy & it was fine- all picked up.
5,It went very well. He was very detailed and put the stand together very professionally. It looks great in my living room.
5,"Instead of having to call one company for one thing, another for something else, and yet another for another thing, I just hand them my list of work and they get it done. I've used them numerous times, the approximate cost of service for this review is for the latest work they did. This time the work included regrouting exterior brick and a complete replacement of an asphalt driveway including adding drainage and hauling away the old asphalt. The pricing is in line with what I expected to pay based on the amount of work needed this time, and I got compliments on multiple occaisions from the city inspectors on the quality of the work they did (including the driveway replacement work). They're good about working around my schedule and that of my tenants. I work second shift and Mike will meet with me after I get off work. And they schedule with my tenants to make sure work that requires they enter the tenants place is done when the tenants want it to be done."
5,"Excellent. Prompt, efficient, did everything I asked and I was very satisfied."
3,"I called customer service and was refunded, but still hanging for work I need done"
5,"Awesome. The workers were kind, polite, professional, and very hard working. I will be using them again."
5,They were very professional. On time and worked hard. Was nice to have the areas cleaned that I needed focused on.
5,2 women came to clean within 24 hours of the purchase and did an excellent job. The work was thorough and they were especially considerate of the fact that I was a cancer patient and coordinated their work around my need for rest during the 3 hour period they were there. Highly recommend their work and their consideration.
5,"Mike Vecchio is the perfect mix of friendly professionalism, and his quote for the job was what I thought it would be, so I accepted his bid right there and he fixed my siding the next day. His company does everything related to home maintenance and repair, and I was happy to find that his brother does landscaping, too. I look forward to doing business with this company in the future. Thanks, Mike!"
5,Awesome service. Well worth the money. I will definitely be calling them for more work in my house.
3,The handyman acted put out by anything I said. Door handle removed to try and replace on storm door. put back in after not acceptable replacement. Door handle found a few weeks later on the porch. I have never had this problem before. I wanted an updated version which is why we were trying to replace I let the boss know No response
3,"Hurried through it and would not finish the ceiling at my request. Came about 1/2 hour late and then took a lunch for about 20 minutes and then acted as if he had to hurry to next job. So, terribly unprofessional. I only got 2/3 of my time and I found chipping on the wall under some dry wall he had repaired. Texted his boss and ""cool"" was the reply. Apparently, he thinks this passes as good service as well"
1,"I initially called The House Doctors and left a message to schedule an estimate. Laurie called me back a couple days later and gave me a different phone number to call to schedule. I called this number several times over a three day period and nobody ever picked up and the voice mail was full. So I called the main number again. Laurie got back to me and scheduled an estimate for Monday March 27th between 1-2 PM. I drove an hour to get to the house where the work was needed. I arrived at 12:30 PM and sat in a lawn chair in plain sight in the driveway reading a book from 12:30 until 2:30. Nobody showed up and nobody called or texted to say they were running late or wouldn't be able to make it that day. I had to turn around and drive another hour back to my current residence. Laurie left me a voicemail two days later, looking to ""get me scheduled for an estimate"", as if I was never scheduled in the first place. No mention of the missed commitment. I work full time and go to school full time, so my time is very limited. I wasted an entire day of my valuable spring break on an estimate I never received."
5,They come in time and keep working for three hours for the move out cleaning. They are very polite and did a great job.
2,"This episode was disappointing at best. I hired a cleaning service to do things I am not physically able to do with my disabilities. What I don't like about Angie's List service is they take my payment first, before the contractor shows up. Sure, if they can't do the job they can turn it down and my money is refunded. But if they accept the job and then do it lousey, where am I? I spoke with owner prior to making appointment. I was assured this type of cleaning was not an extra charge item. I was also told on the phone that the ad was wrong, it was TWO (2) people for 3 hours. I offered my cleaning supplies (Lysol, Pine Sol, Comet cleanser, bleach) I also offered to presoak this mess with wet towels for a day before her arrival, to facilitate it's removal. She says no need. She wants to scrape it with the scraper I provide (and she almost took home with her in the end) She wants to use her Simple Green. OK In the back of my mind I'm thinking: if I have a basement covered in wet towels, and she turns down the job, well now I have to deal with all the wet towels. Owner tells me she has 6 dogs, so is accustomed to cleaning pet mess. In my mind that means she understands the concept of getting it all clean, and deodorized, otherwise the pet will return to that place over and over to poo again. Owner shows up alone for appointment with a list of explanations why her helper called off. I don't care, it's not my problem. Why did she not call to reschedule? 20/20 hindsight, I should have told her upon arrival either come back when your helper is with you, or work here for 6 hours yourself, or give me 3 hours of your time for 1/2 the original price. Otherwise it starts to smell a lot like ""bait and switch"". I try very hard not to micro manage people I hire. I do give very clear specific instruction what I want done, and i make suggestions as to how to accomplish that task in a time efficient manner. Then I walk away, let them work and check in to see the progress every 90 minutes or so. I think it is very unprofessional for a vendor to make small talk with a customer and start telling me all about your medical problems and operations. if you are not physically able to do the job, find another line of work. I started in my kitchen by showing her TWO (2) buckets of cat box scoopings that needed to go to the garbage can. Once they were empty she could use them in the basement to clean up that mess. I specifically said, ""One is full so is very heavy. You can just slide it across the floor instead of picking it up."" Thankfully I found out before she left for the day she had not taken it out and I insisted she do so. She claimed she didn't see it. Um 'scuse me, after I showed it to you? As we made our way down the basement steps i pointed out with my cane the cat mess on the steps that needs to be cleaned. Once down there I continued to point out areas the cats had pooped in, including under my bed and in the basement lav. I specifically said do not worry about cleaning the laundry area as they have not pooed there. I also said cleaning the basement toilet and offered my Comet cleanser. No she is going to use her stuff. After 90 mins I smell something orange and I'm told, come look. I'm told the orange is some sort of enzyme cleaner for pet mess. I find she has wasted a lot of time moving items out of my laundry area to clean the floor i told her not to do. She claims there was cat poo between the buckets and paint cans that had been stacked there. There is no way a cat will wedge it's butt into a tight space like that. They look for a place to dig a hole, and do their thing, then cover it. The floor is so soaking wet, light is reflecting off it. Worse yet, she moved the laundry room stuff to the cat box area, on top of the wet floor so it would take weeks to dry, not to mention mold and mildew. I insisted she move everything back to the laundry area and then gave her a work towel to dry the floor. She tried to throw away my towel. During the last hour I became the helper, in an effort to get the rugs vacuumed that i needed done so that I could wash them.. (it's a 2 person job). This person seems to have an aversion to vacuum cleaners. Although I offered the use of all 3 of mine, her first suggestion was to sweep these throw rugs with a broom. Seriously? She also insisted on sweeping the basement with a broom. After doing those rugs I was in a lot of pain and soaked in sweat; the scenario I was trying to avoid by paying money for a service. About 12 hours after she left I went back to the basement so I could see the floor better after some of the water had evaporated. I was greeted with a fresh pile of cat poo at the bottom of the steps. No surprise why. With the reflection gone from the excess water, it was obvious not all the poo was scrubbed off the floor. Sure, it smelled of orange, but the cats will still smell that poo and think it's a place to ""go"". the steps are not cleaned. a large area of dried poo by the bathroom is not clean. There is poo under my bed and in front of my shower. The toilet; well it looks as though it was wiped out with a dry rag. There are still black mold marks that could easily be scrubbed off with Comet and a sponge. Your perfumy foamy stuff isn't going to cut it. Disappointed in North Olmsted"
5,"They were great, they showed up when they said they would and cleaned up after themselves."
5,Great! They did several small jobs and he was not a clock watcher. Neat and did a great job of cleaning up.
5,The cleaning was thorough and well done.
5,They showed up on time and were very friendly and their work was excellent. Jim was a very helpful and skilled worker and our stairs look great! Definitely worth the money and would hire them again.
5,Really well - the man who actually did the work did a great job. I did have some trouble getting an appointment for the second visit (multiple visits due to materials needing to dry before the next step in the process could continue). I would call them again for any job that I didn't have a super tight timeline on.
5,Good. Came to see what materials were needed then picked them up for me. I really appreciated this.
5,Everything went well with no problems.
1,"We played phone tag for a while and then they would not call back at all. When we call the number now it's ""Pristine Clean."" If we can't get the service we'd like our money back."
3,The primer shows through the tan paint because he didn?t paint it well. He put 2 coats of primer and only 1 coat of paint. I have paneling that goes part way up the wall and the junction where the painted wall meets the paneling he left a white stripe around. He didn?t bring the paint down to meet the paneling so there is a white line that goes around it. I called to tell them the work wasn't done and that you could see the white paint through the tan paint. He said they would only fix it if my Home Insurance company agreed to pay them more. I didn't even care if he re-painted all of the work I just wanted him to touch up where you can see the white paint through the tan paint.
5,The work was done very efficiently.
5,"Great! They arrived on time, had clear understanding of project, gave true estimate of time and cost. We were kept informed of any issues and involved an all decisions. Work was perfectly performed, clean and neat. They matched existing wood stain, painted well and worked around 20 years of basement clutter without a word of complaint! All were polite and friendly."
5,Great experience. Jim was very detailed. Will use again.
4,"It was cold out and rainy, I think they guy didn't necessarily want to be here early. I probably should have rescheduled them another day. They cancelled once or twice. The work that he did do was very good. They're not as professional. Their price and work was excellent. Maybe I will use them again."
1,i purchased a coupon for drywall repair on angies list. i needed my ceiling fixed because of a water issue in the upstairs shower leaking down into the kitchen. i had a lot of trouble getting the guy to come out when promised and when he finally did the repair he performed was actually a disaster. he speckled up the damaged ceiling and when it dried it was full of huge cracks. i ended up going to Ace Hardware and consulting an employee and fixed it myself for free. The guy was super apologetic about not coming back out to fix it and had an excuse about his van being broken into and he lost my phone number....Not possible but the funniest part was at the end of the phone call when he asked me to give a good review on angies list. LMAO
5,Everything was done quickly and efficiently.
2,"The guy came in with a really bad attitude, as if he did not like his job. He used a curse word, and did a very sloppy job and dripped the drywall stuff down the walls. There was stuff all over my kitchen and floor. I found it two weeks later. I would never use them again."
1,After numerous contacts company came up with excuses and never showed up.
4,He noticed the steps and offered to stabilize it. He said he had some spare wood in the truck and offered to stabilize it for me without additional charge. Even though he offered to do the stabilization of the steps he didn't paint the new wood. I would have appreciated him asking if he could paint the new wood to match the steps.
4,Fine. The quality of the work was not all that great.
1,"They did not show for the first appointment-claimed the tech was in the E.R. When the tech did show, he looked around. The first thing he said was that he could only apply material that day-it wouldn't dry in time. He also wanted me to supply drywall topping, even though the agreement states that the contractor would supply it. He had a bag of quick-dry in his truck, which he didn't want to use-this material would have dried in 20 minutes so he could have sanded it. He just acted like he didn't want to be there. He worked 2 hours, said he was done and that I would have to make another appointment to get the project finished, and left. I called twice to speak with the owner, but have not received a call back. Later in the day, I walked outside and noticed my hunting trail camera was missing. His truck was parked 15 feet away. I did not see who took the camera. A very disappointing experience. I still have an unfinished project."
5,The painters came back and did my son's room. That was a little less... The first guy I used a coupon for but then again it didn't cover all the work. This guy was great. He actually did some extra work in the bathroom for me in-terms of fixing the drywall. He installed a new shade for me. He actually textured the ceiling where he fixed it in my kitchen. So there was a bit of correction that he did. I was very pleased. He was not the painter though. You can use all the same scores as for the painters because I combined the two of them. They were all A's but the responsiveness. I would use them again.
5,It went really well! Everything is find & we are ready for the winter.
2,It went over the 1st day @ $45.00 but was never finished. The drywall was service was started and not completed on the ceiling. The House Doctor was supposed to call back on 9/15. Several attempts were made to reach them but they never made good on it.
4,"The problem with House Doctors is scheduling. They don't get back to you very quickly and it can multiple calls to get a response. The last time they were supposed to send 2 guys for two separate deals I purchased, they sent one(who was very good) who could only fill one order. No one called to let me know and no one has return a call I placed 2 days ago to try and reschedule."
2,"The work I wanted done on my deck would be best completed by taking the $129 and put it toward tearing out and putting in a new deck. He measured, and discussed how the material would be purchased before the project would start. He would put the order in at Home Depot and I would go in and pay for the material needed to build this deck and rails. I told him that I would be able to get a discount at Home Depot if he put it in my partners name. He is a Army veteran and would be able to get the discount on the material. He said he would call me to get that information. I even was pro active and called him a week later to see when he planned to call the order into Home Depot. After that call from me to him, I never heard from anyone. No call at all. Then on October 6 at 9:30am, I got a call telling me they were on the way to do the tear out. This was not what we had discussed. How were they going to build the deck? I needed to know a week before they came to coordinate the purchase with my partner. Did they expect me to rush to get the material in one day? Again, this was not how it was supposed to be done. I told the carpenter who called me NOT to come. It already was messed up! I wasn't going to let them start after seeing the way the initial agreement wasn't even binding. He said he had an injury and the ""Office"" at House Doctors was supposed to have called me. NO ONE called me. I did receive a call from the ""owner"" the same afternoon. I told him they really screwed up this deal. He said to tell you that his guy stayed here for an hour and when I called you to tell you that. I would be happy to get a refund for 2 hours since the man who came initially did stay about an hour. I would like a refund."
5,"The carpenter was professional, helpful and pleasant and cleaned up after himself. He also worked steadily, and did not waste time. He called ahead of time to let me know when he was coming."
1,"Unfortunately my experience with House Doctors didn't work well because the specialist came and he couldn't finish the job. First he applied the patches to the hole in our the backyard and he wouldn't paint it because he said that it was too high and then he said if we keep him, then we need to have some kind of contract for a certain job. So I agreed for him to do the job but then the timing didn't work for them so after a couple of months of delay, basically they called me back and they reset an appointment to go the store to buy some wood but then they called me and said that the car was broken and next time they'd call me two or three weeks after. Usually when contractors call you that the car is broken, you can read that they have some other commitments. So I decided not to go to these people and this company. So I'm looking for a new specialist to finish the job. They didn't finish it because they said that the voucher I paid for their job was valid only for one visit. And if I needed a second visit, they said that I should have a new contract with them for some serious repairs and I agreed but, uhm, they replaced the deck but it never worked out because they were delaying and delaying and their car was broken and so I decided that these people are totally unreliable. I would give them an F over-all because they failed to come on time. I asked them also to send me the contract for the service that they needed, if they wanted to do a bigger job, they need to send me the contract. They never sent me any documents to sign. So I think it's a failure, and I think it's really unreliable when they say ""Let's meet"" and the car is broken. That's not the first time when contractors tell you that the car is broken. They always have problems with the car, right? All of them. For me the price was A, I like the price. I have no rating for the quality because the job was never finished."
5,They did some additional work for me too.
5,"The person who came out did a great job. He was on time, friendly, skilled, efficient and professional. He replaced the window sill and painted it. He also caulked and painted parts of a second window and did an excellent job. When I tried to make an appointment, the answering service was disorganized and not very professional. It was difficult to reach a live person. This part of the service needs improvement."
4,Tim was very professional and extremely courteous. After he left I noticed several areas where paint was on the woodwork around doors. I wish he would have taped around them. He did tell me if I found anything to call and he would fix it. I did it myself because I didn't want the paint to dry.
4,Went well other than the service person needed to go purchase additional supplies. Would have thought there should have been an ample amount of patching compound brought.
5,Wainscotting needed to be replace so I had a longer visit and cancelled the special offer. Tim did my work and he is very knowledgeable. The work was reasonably priced. It turned out that I had some mold in one corner and dry wall needed to be replaced also. That was all done and done well.
5,I'm very satisfied with their service
4,"Jim was fantastic! He was polite, fast, skilled, and did an excellent job. The 2 window sills look beautiful. The only problems is getting in touch with the people who do the scheduling. I think they are overwhelmed and don't have a receptionist to take calls. So you have to play phone tag to schedule an appointment. It would help if one could communicate with them via email and schedule an appointment online. I had a coupon, so the price was right."
5,Jim was great! He did a beautiful and efficient job. This only problem is that the office did not call me back promptly. They need to fix this part of the business.
5,"We had a great experience. While the initial estimate appointment had to be changed by one day, we were notified in plenty of time and was not an inconvenience for us. Tim performed the estimate and we agreed to hire The House Doctors for the work. He additionally purchased the supplies needed on that first day as well. We set the day for the work (about a week away), and he and his able helper arrived a couple hours later than scheduled. It was clear that Tim was proficient in all types of home repair. He did electrical and plumbing tasks, carpentry and painting. All were done exactly as we had hoped and the work was done in the amount of time estimated. I would absolutely hire this company again. (Please note that the approximate cost of service includes an Angie's List Deal I purchased for two of the hours of work.)"
4,"They were great. They did a fine job. They were nice guys. They came and did what they said they were going to do efficiently. My interaction with them was fine. He was busy but he got here and did the work. He stayed late to get it done. The work turned out fine. What they did was though they put up the mud, they used a longer setting compound. The problem with that is that's where all the dust come from. I was a little disappointed that they have a $99 deal to repair drywall but they can't stand it which left me to stand it."
5,Appointment was scheduled promptly and work was performed efficiently and with good quality.
5,It went well - did a good job and I purchased a little more time (price given in advance). Would recommend!
5,They replaced the fence post and the fence looks great.
5,"Due to our home remodel running behind schedule, we did not use the deal. I would not hesitate to purchase another deal from the House Doctors in the future. They were prompt to call to schedule our work."
1,"He answered the phone without the name of the business and made it pretty clear, pretty quickly that he wasn't interested in my business probably because the first thing I told him was a small job too far away. Not so great listening skills/customer service. Not sure this company should be listed under ""handymen."" I was so put off by his tone/reaction that I felt the need to put in a review for the next person that might have a smaller job on the west side - I wouldn't bother calling. I am in the real estate business too so who knows what this call could have led to. On a positive note - at least he answered the phone."
1,"AMAZING...at first. They are excellent cleaners. I've no complaints in that regard. But things changed once we left them the glowing Angie's List review. I knew we were a tough assignment -- laundry for a family of four in addition to standard house cleaning -- and I knew Kim and the crew were struggling to find a way to get it done. One moment, they'd tell me they weren't sure it was doable. The next, they'd found a way to make it work and everything was fine. After leaving the review though, it just got more extreme. One moment I was getting angry notes and voice-mails, and when I'd call (which I always did) to ask what I could do to help make the situation better, everything was GREAT again and I was the nicest customer ever. Then, the next week, there'd be another angry note or voicemail. I shouldn't have put up with this, but I didn't want to go through another round of interviewing cleaning companies. I'm a big believer in working problems out and building relationships, and so I kept trying to make this work from my end, even making sure the new washing machine I bought would meet the needs and wants of the cleaning team. And every time, they were satisfied...until they weren't. Finally, I received a long and condescending voicemail, laying out all that was wrong with my house and with the job, informing me they'd taken pictures (I'm sorry--what??) and telling me not to bother calling -- they were done with me and would not change their minds. Look, I get it. Ours was a tough job (tougher than either I or they expected), and, despite their best efforts, they couldn't get it all done. Sure, we had a previous cleaning team that was able to accomplish all of this for less money and had no complaints about our house (nor felt the need to take photographs of our home without our permission as a form of threat???), but whatever. Had we been able to have a real conversation about this, something could have been worked out, but I never had the opportunity. Either things were GREAT or they were TERRIBLE, no room to troubleshoot when things are that bi-polar. If you're looking for a one time clean, I fully endorse these people. Despite my clear frustration with the situation, they are top-notch cleaners who do a thorough job. I give them credit for that and thank them. But they do not have the mettle for long term arrangements. These are not people you can build a relationship with, troubleshoot issues with, or depend upon in the long run. I expect a long reply to this review, laying out everything that was wrong with our house and with the job (which, by the way, felt extremely insulting, hurtful, and threatening in terms of the photographs). Once again, I did all I could to oblige them, was always kind and understanding with concerns expressed, and never once said ""no"" to anything they suggested or asked for. I get that the job, as originally laid out, wasn't one they ultimately felt they could keep up with, despite their best efforts. I wouldn't leave a bad grade for ""We tried, but it just can't work. Sorry."" That's not the issue. The bi-polar nature of these exchanges, the condescending tones, the threat of photographs (???), and the quitting out of nowhere when everything was presumably ""great"" as of our last communication...that's what rubbed me the wrong way and has left me concerned for their future customers."
5,"Very well for the most. Be sure you know that the handyman first assesses the materials needed for the job, then goes to the nearest Lowe's or Home Depot to buy it and you, of course, have to pay for it."
1,I purchased a deal and scheduled an appointment. I called them three or four times and they never called back to let me know if they can perform the service or not.
1,"To use an old movie line "" what we have here is failure to communicate"" Left 3 voice mails, used online scheduling have not heard or seen any type of communication. Will be asking Angie to cancel."
4,"There estimate was extremely high. They were polite and helpful, it was just the price that I found excessive."
2,"I have not heard nor have I received an e-mail with the quotes. I called Mike's cell phone left a message, no return call. I called the office and again left voice mail and no return call."
3,"The guy did a nice job of it, but he took a lot longer. He was putzing around a bit, but he did a nice job for what I needed. So, I was fine with it. I think he could have got it done with the time allotted. There was an additional charge because they said that if it went over the three hours, there is going to be so much an hour. I think there was an extra $60 for another hour. For the $99 considering it was another $60, I guess the price was fine because it went an hour longer and it was a discount to begin with. He was a few hours late. I would probably use them again, but I would stay with them to make sure they keep moving because when he was here, I was at work and my husband was just letting him do his thing out there and I could see when I came home that for what time he got here, he really had not got much done."
2,"I ordered a 'deal' off Angie's List, and was contacted to set up a date to come to do the carpentry work. The appt. was for 7/5/16 between 10 and 12 noon. No one showed. I contacted the scheduler and the office several times and was not able to get any information about the install. I called AL and cancelled the deal and was refunded since it was within 30day window.. Someone did contact me after 1:30 pm but it was too late. That is not acceptable to me. I arranged my day off to accommodate them, they should at least have the ability or the decency to update the customer. UPDATE 1/20/2017: The service providers response is inaccurate, I was home all day and contacted them twice and left messages. I received a voicemail the following day, but had already canceled the deal and received a credit before the call."
5,I liked that they were prompt and they did good work. They knew exactly what they were doing and did a very nice job.
5,"Went well. Prepared and painted entry doors, case molds and baseboards in master bath, guest bath, and laundry room. Cleaned, scrubbed, and power washed all of the garage floor. Replaced and painted 14 deck boards. Replaced 2 mesh kitchen window screens. Previously, had side garage door replaced and painted inside and out. Also, had deck and front steps power washed. House is 17 years old, and looks brand new inside and out."
5,"Mark, the handyman who showed up to perform the work, did a great job. In our area, there is a layer of shale under a few inches of dirt. It was not a easy job, but Mark did it. He made sure the post was straight and was responsive to all of our concerns. I would certainly use this company again."
5,"It went very, very well. We are extremely pleased with the work that was mostly done by Jim. He did an outstanding job."
1,I called 2 week ago to set up appointment the never returned my call. what they are advertising is not true they will call and tell you that they can not do the work. They said they were all booked up I have been calling for three weeks with unanswered phone calls.
4,"When the provider called to schedule an appointment, they were booked for a month in advance. I didn't realize that they would be so busy. I couldn't wait that long so I decided to go with someone else. They worked very hard to try and fit me in but it just didn't work out. They were very sorry for the inconvenience and apologized to me. They seemed very nice and understanding about the whole thing."
5,The service provider was late but provided excellent service when he got here. He did quality work on all of the repairs. I would definitely hire them again.
5,Went well. They cleaned everything we had asked them to do. They also cleaned and put back the accessories on top of the entertainment center.
5,They were wonderful. The work they did was very nice.
1,"I originally purchased a $99 Angie's List Deal for 3 hours for drywall repair. I also expressed that I needed a separate quote to put a ceiling in the basement, since I'm refinishing it. They were supposed to come out on May 3rd, but had to cancel and reschedule. No big deal, that was fine. They weren't able to schedule until May 31. That was somewhat problematic as I had a tenant moving in prior, and wanted the repairs done. But I thought, it's OK. Especially because the lady who answers their phones, Kim, is Such a great lady (super nice and accommodating). That day the person comes out, we go over the job and he starts telling me he'd want to tear apart pretty much the whole 3rd floor for a few bad areas. I expressed that that seemed overkill, and he back pedaled and said that it wouldn't be everything. He said it would be a day and a half, but he could get started with the demolition, since he thought that would take 3 hours. I let him know that A: I thought 3 hours seemed kind of ridiculous for tearing out a couple of smaller sections, and B: I wasn't comfortable having them put holes int he walls and then getting back to me later with the cost of filling the holes and me having NO idea when they'd even schedule that job or anything. I told him I needed a written quote, before ANY additional work could be started. He tried to pressure me into letting him do the work now, because they sold a lof of the coupons and they don't like to reschedule,. I again said he could not put holes in the walls for 3 hours when I didn't know the cost for repairs - nor the schedule. He also tried to tell me the lathe work was bad and that's why some of the plaster was separating. I explained and showed him the lathing was fine, and again expressed it was Clearly from water damage form before the new roof (you could even see discoloration from the water. The owner of the company was supposed to come out later that day to give me a quote for the ceiling in the basement and I was told he'd look at the job and quote it then. I got a call abut 10 minutes later, and was told he talked to the owner and based on his description to the owner, it would take 3 days and cost $1450. He said he'd like to start now. I noted that we suddenly went from a day and a half to 3 days. I told him, he was quoting a bigger project than I had anticipated, and that I wasn't going to have them start anything without an Actual WRITTEN quote. Later that day, I got a call from the owner. He was supposed to come give me the estimates between 1 and 2 pm and I had taken the time out of the office to be there. It was 1:56 pm. he was asking if we could schedule a time for the next day for him to give me a quote. I reminded him that we already had an appointment that was supposed to be right now. He didn't apologize or anything, and simply said ""So, can we do it tomorrow"". I REALLY want to get the plaster repaired and get a quote for the ceiling, so I can get it Done - so I agreed. The next day, he didn't show up. There's been no call, no attempt to reschedule, no apology or acknowledgement. And he isn't answering his cell that he called me from. Suffice it to say, I won't be using them. There were a ton of red flags - from saying the lathes were bad and had to be cut out without even looking at them, to trying to turn a 3 hour $99 plaster repair into a day and half job, to taking the day and a half and trying to turn it into a 3-day $1450 job, to wanting to demolish part of a ceiling and wall without any quote for cost or promise to return. So, if you're thinking about using this company - no. Just, no."
5,"I knew I was a fan of Kim when she first came to the house to give us an estimate. She was personable, friendly, honest, and driven. She has since remained involved as the team assigned to our home has gotten used to the routine, troubleshooting issues when they arose. We had a cleaning team that serviced our home for five years and, when they retired, we were sure we'd never find anyone as good again, but it's safe to say that these folks do it BETTER. Our house hasn't looked this clean since we first moved in, the attention to detail is extraordinary, and Kim truly goes overboard to ensure that the customer is pleased with their work. I've heard of folks going the extra mile, but Kim goes an extra football field to make sure things work out right. The cost per visit is a little outside of our affordability range right now, but Kim is working hard to find ways to get the enormous job that our house entails done in less time so that the cost comes down in the long term. She does this with resourcefulness and determination, and yet never compromises quality in the process. I cannot recommend The House Nurses enough."
3,"First day 3 people came including owner Kim, did kitchen and large pantry. Work looked good. Later on looking closely found that the top of the kitchen cabinets had not been washed. Day two same 3 people came back, cleaned downstairs bathroom and finished work on pantry and kitchen. Day three only Kim came, other two women had previous commitments and could not work. Kim tried to get the livingroom room done by herself but did not get all the work done. One wall needed washing over fireplace and part of another wall. Things were left on mantle, glass ware and. etc. Also other items were in left that had been moved to help her clean. I had washed the curtains but they are still not up. I will have to finish the room myself. I decided to wash the glassware myself plus the mantle. We were charged $325.00 for each day of work, even the final day when Kim worked alone. I think the final day should have been rescheduled to a time when she could have two other workers with her. The work could have been completed. She gave me another appointment for May 25, about one and a half weeks after the livingroom work was begun. The living room was and still is a mess. When it came near their next visit I called to cancel the May 25th appointment. We had been told the days fee would be $265 per day, not $325. We had no written contract,only the price written on the back of their business card. When the price was given for the day they had not mentioned what it would be until they finished for the day. They would only take cash or personal check, luckily I had enough to write a check. As I said, I called and canceled because we had run out of money. I felt that we were being put in to their system where openings were available. I must add that my husband and myself are handicapped. We were told to move things away from the walls. We did the best we could, they were not very specific in what we needed to do. I had hoped to have my home looking good by the first of June so that I could invite people into my house again. It hasn't happened and I am very frustrated. The work they did was OK though spotty. Communication was not good. And the final day should have been rescheduled so that three workers could have taken on the livingroom room and foyer."
5,"Did a good job on everything around the house, that I need fix in the time frame."
5,$109 for 3 Hours of Drywall or Plaster Repair
5,"I was pleasantly surprised when I came home and found the amount of progress made on the first floor, I didn't expect they would get to it at all with the time allotted. I asked my son on the phone how the bathroom looked and he said, ""just like new."" I was in the kitchen and I was trying to figure out why the kitchen seemed so much brighter, I realized the lamp covers were dusted. First, I was in shock over what a difference it made and second, I was impressed that a detail like that was done. I've never had my house cleaned, but after 50-60 hours a week for the last year and half I needed some help catching up. My husband was quite happy as well. The bathrooms did look great. They said they would show up between 9:30 and 10:00 and arrived at just about 10am. Kim called a couple days prior to reconfirm everything. Completely professional company and quality service."
5,Kim and Jesse came out and did 3 hours of house cleaning my house look brand-new better than ever they were very professional on time and went beyond services rendered their extremely polite and I would highly recommend them again to anybody who is looking for a house cleaning services one of my friends from Angie's List referred me to them I would love to give them a page of happiness but cannot find it in this review section to do so I would highly recommend and rehire them for additional services
5,Called to let me know they'd be a bit late (more than fine!) and they did a nice and through job cleaning for first time at my home!
5,Kim came out and did 3 hours of work at my home she was very punctual very courteous and very professional my house looks spotless and shiny it smells very good and she did excellent work she was very efficient and did not stop until the work was done I would definitely use the house nurse again on a job she was referred to me by a friend and did excellent work
1,Employee late rude and not effective tore window shade
4,was kind of nervous at first because I did not receive a follow up call the day before. I did call the morning scheduled and had to leave a message. Handyman called about 30 minutes before. He arrived on time. It took him awhile to figure out one of the shelves because I had lost the instructions and it was partially installed. But the work he completed I was very pleased with. Did a very good job.
5,"Did a wonderful job, was on time and cleaned up after the job was completed"
5,"When we finally made an appointment for reviewing our project the provider called to confirm. Then when their prior appointment changed, they called before coming out earlier than expected. Overall I appreciated their repeated efforts to get and keep in touch. I thought they were very professional and if needed willcontact them again."
5,He was very professional and did a great job.
4,"They worked out fine. They came out and did a few things around my house. They did fine. The person was fine. The one thing that I had a problem with was that the one fixture they changed out had a light bulb that was burnt out, and they had to back and change the bulb. He didn't tell me the light bulb was burnt out. He was a little early which was good. He was very professional. He was very friendly, and I have a dog and he wasn't put off by the dog which is always nice. He was a nice person."
5,Mark arrived on time and was very professional. The repairs look great. The scope of the repairs exceeded the limit of the coupon. We are so pleased with the work that we will be having them come agin to finish up. Thanks
4,Our house door frame was not fixed.
5,"Kim went out of her way to schedule my cleaning for when I wanted it. Kim arrived on time, brought all of her supplies, and got to work right away. I don't think she stopped to rest at all in three hours- she worked tirelessly. My house has not had a thorough cleaning before (so it needed cleaning), and Kim made the rooms look great. Kim worked around all the stuff I still had on my kitchen counter with no hesitation. Kim asked when she had questions, and was very cognizant of making sure I was happy with her work. She made sure she completed what she could and did not try to run out of here when the three hours was up. I would have no second thoughts about hiring her again. She was polite and professional and I am extremely pleased with the experience I had."
3,I paid them $160 for 2 hours of additional labor.
1,After this company never showed up for the scheduled appointment a few years ago I thought I would give them another try since they continue to get decent reviews. Called and made an appointment a few weeks ago and I got stood up for the second time- unbelievable. Called the number I was given when I made the initial appointment after no one showed up and left a message and no call back.
5,"I hired House Nurses to provide a good cleaning to my elderly parents' 2 BR, 2.5 bath condo. I couldn't have been happier with the outcome. Kim arrived on time and dug right in. Over the course of three+ hours, she did a very thorough job in the kitchen and bathrooms, which are the areas where I asked her to focus. She brought her own tools and equipment to do the job. I was very impressed. She did much more than just normal surface cleaning. She got into the corners, nooks, and crannies - on her hands and knees when necessary. Since she gave the kitchen and bathrooms such a good cleaning, hopefully it won't be so tough next time. After the kitchen and bathrooms were done, there wasn't much time to do a couple of the other rooms but Kim stayed a little longer and dusted and vacuumed all around - which my mom really appreciated. I would hire House Nurses again in a heartbeat. My parents plan to use her for regularly monthly cleaning since it's getting too hard for my parents to do it themselves. Kim is a hard worker - no breaks, no messing around - while still being polite and professional."
5,"I purchased the 3 hours of deep house cleaning special. I was at work so I left a detailed note on what I wanted done. Everything was cleaned above and beyond, living room, dining room, kitchen, stairwell, bathroom. I am very happy with the service."
5,"I couldn't be happier with the job, from the consult to the finished product. All the people involved were extremely helpful, courteous, and professional. I told Mike what I kind of wanted done and he knew exactly what I didn't know how to ask for and his staff executed it perfectly. Not once did I have to question or correct what they were doing. I would and in fact am already planning on having them back for some more work at my house."
4,"Went ok, but needs to come back to sand and paint, very difficult getting scheduled"
5,"Kim was very prompt and very friendly. I told her what I had needed done and explained that I have not been in my house for 6 months, I had rented it out. The full bath was pretty dirty with makeup, hair, etc ground in to the floor. The bathtub/shower looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. Kim did a great job getting 99% of the floor clean which is EXTREMELY impressive, it was in BAD shape. She did a good job on the rest of the bathroom as well. She even went so far as removing a window valance (that wasn't mine) which was filthy. Kim asked me if I wanted her to take it downstairs to the laundry. I told her it wasn't mine and she could just throw it out. After finishing the bathroom she came downstairs and asked me what else I wanted done because I still had time left that I paid for. She cleaned the half bath as well and wiped out the inside of my refrigerator. I also want to mention that while Kim was upstairs I cleaned out my refrigerator of all the leftover food containers (left from my renters). I filled up 90% of a large garbage bag that was still sitting in my kitchen when Kim asked if I wanted my refrigerator wiped out. When she was through she asked me if I wanted her to take out that garbage bag. I told her I could get it and she said that's what I'm here for. She promptly tied the bag shut and took it outside to my garbage can...IMPRESSIVE!! Kim did a GREAT job and again, was very personable. THANKS KIM!!!"
5,Replaced an ENTIRE half-bath ceiling (demo/clean/add studs/drywall/three muds) in 4 hours. Agreed to comp him for the 4th hour; he cleaned up and you'd never know he was there. I only had minor mud on the walls to sand down and use touch up paint.
5,"I purchased an Angie's Deal for two hours of handyman labor and am delighted to report that my experience was completely positive. The gentleman arrived on time, completed the tasks, and cleaned up afterwards. He was professional and polite -- I couldn't have asked for more. I will definitely contact The House Doctors for future tasks!"
1,"Angie's List should have a new category for contractors that do not follow-up with homeowners. This seems to be the rule rather than the exception with contractors listed here. This contractor was quick to return my call, sort of quick to come to our house and review the work to be performed, and quick to promise us a write up for an estimate. Unfortunately that was the end of it. No follow-up, no estimate, not a call, not a return call. Do not support this contractor. Interesting. I actually contacted the contractor and advised that we found the location of the leak. I requested that they go to next phase and advise as to what could be done and to provide a cost estimate. I have checked the voice mail logs and caller ID logs. No return call was ever made."
5,She was prompt and thorough. I would use her again.
5,"Such a deal! They were on-time, cleaned up, but did not do finish work. Just so you know what to expect."
5,First time using a house cleaning. Kim was great. She offered suggestions and helped do some organizing on top of just cleaning. House has never looked better. I look forward to her next visit.
5,"They did a fantastic job. It was far, far beyond my expectations, in fact. Everything was picked up, dusted and wiped down throughly, vacuumed, corners and crevices were taken care of, window sills cleaned and more. I'm really happy with the job and would gladly call on them again."
5,The work went very well. The installer was on time and did a professional job with the installation.
5,Kim did an excellent job in both bathrooms. I especially like that she took down the blinds and washed them in the bathtub along with removing grit along the shower tracts. I was very pleased with the job she did on both rooms! Thank you! I will definitely call again in the future...
3,good job.
5,"Easy to arrange schedule. Got a call in the morning from the contractor - uh, oh, worried about the inevitable upsell. But that wasn't the case - he wanted to explain that the baseboard was quite a bit wider than the one I had supplied, and the vertical board had some millwork in it that wouldn't look completely like the regular board I had supplied. He could and did do the work with the materials supplied, he just wanted to let me know there would still be hidden parts of the baseboard that were probably decayed behind the new wood, and that the vertical piece would look a little different than what came down. No ask for an upsell, he just wanted me to know. Very professional. When I got home, the work looked great. I like these guys."
5,"From the person who schedues the appointmets (Kim) to the person who did the work, I could not have asked for more pleasant and professional people. James, I think that was the young man's name, was on time and worked steadily from the time he arrived until he left. He finished the original job I asked for in less than two hours, so he was able to do the additional job of caulking. I have absolutely no complaints!"
5,"After reading the reviews and looking at the deal, I chose The House Doctors for my drywall work and am very happy I did. They were great! Quality work, professional and courteous! The best part, they even cleaned up at the end, taking the time to run a wet cloth over my floors to clean up the dry wall dust! I've had contractors who won't even clean up the scraps and wasted material, let alone any mess they make. I would not hesitate to use them again!"
4,They were fine. There was a little mix-up with the scheduling dates. We had to keep scheduling it. The work was done a month later. The workers were professional.
5,"professional, courteous, cleaned up thoroughly, patched all issues I noted and found some additional issues in need of repair"
5,Very good service. I'm probably going to hire them again this summer.
5,"He was right on time, and he gave me a confirmation call 30 minutes before he arrived as promised. He cleaned up all of the paint scrapings. He was professional and very friendly."
5,Purchased a Big Deal for 3 hours of deep cleaning for $99. Arrived promptly at the scheduled time. Reviewed our list of priorities and quickly got to work. Did not quite finish everything on the list in the allotted time but did a thorough job in the areas that were cleaned. Would certainly consider using this service again.
5,"Service was great! Scheduler was very pleasant and accommodating. Service visit was on time as scheduled. The gentleman that came to do the work was pleasant, knowledgable, and thorough. He finished some molding on the main staircase and built out shelving in a kitchen pantry. His work was done well and he cleaned up after all was finished."
4,This was a big deal purchase. It was alright. They were not able to do what I really needed.
5,"He did a very nice job replacing what he could in the 4 hours of time I purchased through an Angie's List Big Deal. He showed me what problems were created by the need for a new roof - water damage that I did not realize could be a result of the old roof.He was pleasant, helpful, and professional."
5,"When Mike tore out the damaged floor of the corner cabinet under the kitchen sink, he found that the builder, Shore West, had left an open hole under the floor of the cabinet instead of properly ducting it to the register, thereby allowing moisture to accumulate under the cabinet. That is what caused the floor to collapse. He explained how he could fix it properly and offered us the option. After agreeing to everything he explained very well, he went to Home Depot and picked up alternative flooring that would allow for a more finished product and all the other necessary supplies to fix the heating ventilation and plumbing problems under our sink. He spent an additional 2 hours and fixed everything perfectly. He cleaned everything up beautifully and was very personable. It looks amazing and we are so happy we went with his professional expertise and had it done right. He was not pushy at all like many other repairmen we encounter and was very trustworthy."
3,"It did not turn out well. The deal just didn't go as I purchased. I purchased for $99 3 hours of carpentry. First of all they were late but they called to say they were going to be late. When they showed up, they had no information at all about what they were supposed to do. I had an appointment with the House Doctors to have the work done. I don't claim to be smart. They did work but they did not give me credit for 3 hours of any kind of work. I paid almost $800. One of those gentlemen from the company was supposed to call me back. If he called me back, I didn't get the call. I chose the House Doctors because about 8 years or so ago when they came out and they replaced a part in my yard. The first time I used them, they were great and I had no problem. Because part of this was my fault because I was not assertive enough. It was an annoying experience. The owner of House Doctors should have said, What happened here? I paid $850 and I asked about the $99 that I paid for the Angie's List deal. He subtracted that $99 so I paid them $750. I said to myself, it's ridiculous for me to have paid them this much money when I was supposed to have gotten 3 hours of service. I didn't have any problem with the work that they did especially the young men that did my porch. The other thing that surprised me was that they put the stuff in a bag, like the old post, whatever junk was left from the repair, they put them in a bag and put it beside my garage. I am in my 70's and I was supposed to get it to the front, but how? I guess that was my business. I didn't see any evidence of the material because it seemed like they cleaned up so well. My daughter came by and asked what was the bag beside the garage. That had to be thrown away or they should have at least asked me if I have a way of getting it away from here. I think he did a good job on the porch. Just the haphazardness of the way they showed up and absolutely had nothing. I believe that the Angie's List deal that I had purchased is because of the appointment and the time and the people's names that were used when I made the appointment. One of those guys went out to Home Depot to purchase everything that they needed. I paid for everything out of my pocket. I have talked about having them do 3 doors. They told me the price for that would be $900. I said they were crazy. I am going to purchase the door and it's going to cost me somewhere in the area of $900 for them to put them in. That was what one of the gentlemen was supposed to call me back and talk to me about. That is not going to happen."
3,"I thought the price was a lot when I saw the finished product. I was expecting them to do a wood restoration that would make the wood look good and the wood did not look good. It does not look good. I know it was sanded down and all that. But, it does not look good. He explained that he did what he could with it. They could have been more responsive to my phone calls."
5,One time and did a good job.
4,"The guys brought out the compound and spackling. What happened was when he got to my mother's house he had some spackling but not enough to do the complete job. What he had on his truck was enough to do only one coat. He told us that after everything dries we'd need to sand it and do a second and maybe a third coat and then it'll be ready for painting. I would like for them to come out, sand, and put on the remaining coats and get it ready so that we can paint it. What he's done so far is good, it's just incomplete. My grades are provided that they come and finish the job."
3,"Called the day before. Changed time to 9 am was 930 Said it would be 2 people only one showed. I saw that the person had called at nine. So when I called her back she stated I'm on the way .Do you have a mop. Got to my house after 940. Started her timer. Only washed down my cabinets in a small L shaped kitchen, My cabinets did have grease on them but not 3 hours worth. And she used my products and did not placed them back where she got them from."
5,"They came in, we walked through what I wanted done, prioritized the room needs and then proceeded to do exactly what I needed. They were wonderful, professional and very nice. Everything was professionally handled and they treated the house as they would their own. Thanks!"
5,"Provider was unable to come on original date due to staff illness. She agreed to do job herself the next day. She arrived promptly with one helper. They got started right away and worked very hard. They swept and mopped, cleaned tub and shower, wiped down cabinets and counters, stove and refrigerator."
1,"I used the Angie's List service to purchase a coupon for $99 of drywall work (sucker!) from The House Doctors back in January of 2015. I provided all of the information and provided 3 suggested dates for the work. Here is the note I attached to the job, just to give the reader an idea of the scope of the work: ""Several wall and ceiling areas need this service, including one large area in the ceiling over the landing on the stairs. I will most likely purchase more time to ensure everything gets done. Thanks!"" Here's what happened: -The response, immediately via Angie's List (left out the names and phone numbers, etc): ""Hi xxxxxx. Please send your phone number to xxxxxx@xxxx.com or call Michael xxxxx at xxx-xxx-xxxx to get scheduled. Thanks, Bob xxxxx"" - I emailed Bob promptly and gave him 2 phone numbers where he could attempt to reach me, and I received a quick response that day that they would be in touch. - With no guarantee of when they would contact me for scheduling, I contacted Bob again via email 2 days later. - Another immediate response, this time to say I would be contacted that day or the next, or that i could call Michael if I needed faster scheduling. ""Today or tomorrow"" sounded perfectly fine, so I waited.... Then I called Michael at the number provided and left a message with my name and phone number. - 4 weeks later, I decided to send another message, this time via Angie's List. I included photos of the work I needed done, and let them know I would call Michael that day, which I did, and left another message. - The response, immediately via Angie's List: ""Hi xxxxxx. We can certainly help you out with your drywall project. Please send your phone number to xxxxxx@xxxx.com or leave a message for Michael at xxx-xxx-xxxx and he will schedule your work. Thanks, Bob xxxxx"" - I responded via Angie's List that the person on the other end of the email they provided (Bob?) had my phone number for weeks already, but that I would attempt to call Michael again as soon as I had time. Which I did, and left a message... - Some time went by and I hired another business to complete the work. I can only assume that they were not interested in the business of someone who had pre-paid for a small amount of labor, even though the job would have guaranteed them far more money. The pictures I provided clearly show I needed more than $99 of labor, but they didn't bother to even provide a quote. I guess business was booming. Needless to say, I will not be hiring them for any of the many other jobs I need completed, nor will I recommend them to others. Not that they seem to need it."
5,"The gentleman came out and did everything we asked him to do with a smile. We replaced the thresholds on the front and back doors, they were rotted and and needed reinforcement. He did everything the way it should be done and didn't cut corners. A very hard worker."
4,They did very well taking them down so i could paint them. Then they rehung them up for me. It went very well for everything...
5,Wonderfully professional. Very courteous. Took the time to learn what was my highest priority and accommodated my preference. Checked in to make sure they were meeting my needs. Very efficient. I would absolutely recommend these house cleaners.
5,"Had had House Doctors do some fence repairs earlier this year and was very pleased. Bought the three hour big deal and left message. Company returned call next day and set up appointment for a couple of weeks out. I called back discovering that I had a repair due date to meet--and responded to best ,meet my needs. I purchased the lumber. Carpenter came on time and seemed to do a very good job on fence repairs. He worked the full three hours, was friendly and cleaned up old materials, bring them to the tree lawn for pickup. I knocked him down to ""B"" on professionalism because he didn't seem to have all the tools etc with him to do fence work. Overall very good experience."
5,"I had three areas of damage to my home's ceilings from plumbing leaks. I have been trying to get someone to repair this for a long time. It needed to have the taping removed for a large area in the kitchen and i was afraid the stippling would not match. My home is 26 years old. He did a fantastic job of repairing it and it is hardly noticeable. Since the builder did not ever paint the ceiling, I was able to just leave the repair as it is and don't even have to paint it. It blends right in. He was courteous and professional and went above and beyond to complete my work. I used the Big Deal and paid a little extra for the extra time he had to spend while the plaster cured."
2,My initial coupon was for 3 hours. I have 2 areas on ceilings that needed repair. One had the drywall already pieces in. The other needed a 2x2 piece pieced. They arrived late and had 2 guys. One guy did virtually nothing. The other did all the work which was not a lot. In 1.5 hours the coupon was used up because they arrived with 2 people. I needed a return trip because one of the areas needed to dry. I get that. I placed calls to schedule a return. No calls back. Very poor customer service.
5,"I gave a B for quality, not because of the work, but because i had to buy a 2nd coupon to finish the job"
5,"The provider was prompt, courteous, and professional. She had all of her own tools and cleaning products. The provider explained what she was going to do and she did it. The rooms smell fresh and clean. The kitchen floor has never been cleaner. While not perfect, the provider put in two hours of work on the rooms and her efforts show."
5,Ordered the Angie's List Big Deal for $79. Emailed company. Kim emailed and called within 48 hours to set appt. Kim came on time. Cleaned as indicated. Very polite and professional.
1,"After a week, I still hadn't received an estimate so I called and left a message informing him that I had not received an estimate. I again gave my phone number and email address thinking maybe he lost it. After not hearing anything after my call for another 3 days, I left another message asking for the estimate. The next day I received a call from a woman at the business stating that the owner was out of town for a couple days and that I could expect to hear something on Monday. Well it is now Thursday and have still not been contacted. Not a very responsive business. Company states in their response that they emailed an estimate twice. This is completely untrue. After I originally did not hear from them, I left a voice mail message stating my email address AGAIN. I never received ANY email. In addition, their was never any attempt to call me after they said they would. Their response appears to be a canned response similar to another poor rating on October 8, 2015. I just updated my rating to an F for professionalism as well due to unethical response."
5,They came out and they were very good. We had our ceiling fans up and we took them down.
5,"The first time I called them, it was late September 2015. I called on a weekend to leave a message. Bob Vecchio returned my call in less than 5 minutes. He said, ""not to worry"" and ""plenty of time left to repair porch before it gets too cold to paint."" His son Mike met with me on October 8 to give me an estimate for the work. He was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. He explained in detail what they would do. The estimate arrived about two days later via email. The price seemed very fair. Work started on October 26. Jim came on time and worked very efficiently. It was clear to me that he was quite comfortable with porches. He tore open the porch to check what was going on underneath. Mike came out to inspect too and he advised me on the additional work needed to reinforce the joists. He had told me ahead of time that there would be additional costs for the joists but it would ""not be thousands of dollars."" It turned out to be about $800 which I understood. Jim worked alone and finished the entire job in two days. Pretty amazing given he had to reinforce ALL of the joists, correct what the previous contractors had done and replaced 80% of the tongue and groove boards. Mike came out two times to follow up and to make sure I was happy. I'm a graphic designer and I'll be honest, I'm very particular about work in our house being done neatly and correctly. I am not exactly easy to please. Jim is an excellent carpenter. He is very quiet, professional and neat. This is the second time he has done work at our house. The first experience was a side door installation and that went very well too. The porch looks fantastic and it appears to be very solid. The wood came primed, so my husband stained it a few days later. It's in tip-top shape for the winter now! Thank you, House Doctors!"
5,Showed up on time & didn't stop until job was complete...
5,"The old ball and chain decided to place a doorway between our living room and dining room for quiet and privacy while watching TV. I hated the door because it made the house seem smaller. After several years of complaining he took it down but procrastinated about rebuilding the doorway frame. When I saw the deal for The House Doctor I jumped on it. Mike arrived on time, was very professional and did not leave a mess."
2,"Two young man came on time. Pleasant and receptive. The work was to repair bottom of door frame and loose door sill. 1. He and his assistant started to cut out rotten part of the frame and part of sub floor. They needed to fill the gap. They cut 1x4 and painted one piece and did not paint the other piece. Made 2 pieces rather than one. Attached to floor joist with glue and screws. They could not put back door sill because there is no sub floor. They had to put screws to metal part of the door sill to anchor it. It is not very stable. 2. To repair bottom of door frame, they cut out rotten part of the frame. They put pieces of wood to replace cut out part of door frame. Pieces of wood did not fit well, they needed many trial and error to make it fit. The finish is not even, part of the replaced wood is sticking out. 3. They cracked inside of door frame while doing the work, for which they put caulk and a screw to avoid separation. 4. They did not buy correct weather sseal for bottom of the door, had to buy another one which I paid again. They had to make another trip to the Home depot, which took another 25 minutes (First trip to Home depot was to buy 1x4 wood and weather seal). Next day, I had to remove and make it fit because metal part was deforming weather strip. 5. While removing the door to replace weather strip they made 2 ugly gouges to inside door frame. 6. They did not have tarp to protect my newly installed wood floor. The men worked as much as they know how to do it. I do not blame them. I have problem with The house doctor. They should have sent skilled person to do the job. They sent inexperienced workers. Due to the trial and error it took much longer to do the job and caused some damages to the door frame. It took total 8.5 man hour and I had to pay $195 extra. The Angie's list coupon was $111 for 3 hour. I have hired a lot of contractors from Angie's list. This is first time I am reporting because Angie's list members should know about the company."
5,The problem we had...no hot water...is gone and we are very pleased.
5,Nice job - very polite - would use again.
4,"It went fairly well, however, it cost me more money. One of the helper's was not as professional, I would use them again but request a different person to help."
4,"This was an Angie's List deal and scheduling with this provider was difficult. When the person would call and leave a message for me to call her to schedule, I would quickly return her call, and had to call and leave a message more than once just to get someone to call. To be honest, after all the attempts I can't remember the exact date when I was finally able to get the work done. When the two young men came out, they were punctual and professional. And the work was satisfactory. I had to pay extra to get the drywall in the condition it really needed to be. And for them to sand and paint would have cost $50-65 more. That did not seem like a good deal to me. The area was not that large. I'm not sure I would use them in the future, but if I did, it will not be with an Angie's Special. I would instead get a quote for the entire job first. Also, the date that I have entered may not be the correct date the work was done, so i apologize to the vendor. I do not have access to my files right now to retrieve the invoice, and I had to enter a date in order to complete the review."
4,"I think it was $99 for four hours. They did good work but I had to figure out a way to get it painted. They did good work but they did not finish it. I don't have a ladder tall enough so I think although they were actually doing work, it kind of caused me to do more work. I would have been nice if they had offered a solution to have it finished. They were there longer than the deal was for, which was fine, but I felt like that pricing was a little bit high. The quality of work seemed good, but they just didn't finish or offer a way to finish it."
1,"Before making the purchase of the Big Deal for plaster repair, I sent a message to the company through Angie's List briefly explaining the type and size of the repair in the ceiling plaster. I also said the property was in Lakewood and I asked if they were registered to work in Lakewood. I received a message back that they could help me with the repair and they could work in Lakewood. Based upon this information, I purchased the Big Deal. I got a call from someone at the company wanting to set up a date for the repair. This is a rental property and I had to clear the work with the tenant. When that was set, I called the company back to set up the date. After a week, I got a call back and the time was set for July 14, with their worker to arrive between 10:00 - 11:30 a.m. On the day of the appointment, I was at the property at 10 am and waited. At 11:30 exactly, the worker showed up. We went to the room and he looked at the area and said it could not be repaired and the entire ceiling would have to be replaced at a cost of approximately $1,000. I said that was not an option and we left. But I was not surprised by this situation because I felt that this company was very unprofessional from the beginning. First of all, it was obvious that they never read my messages about the problem because they kept asking me for my phone number which I provided in the messages. Secondly, they never asked for any detailed information about the problem, photos or anything. Because they don't go to the site to evaluate the problem, I believe they are really unprepared to take care of anything except small issues. I also want to note that this company is not on the Lakewood Building Department's list of registered contractors, as I was lead to believe by the company. Strangely enough, the day after the appointment, I had a call from a lady at The House Doctors checking to see if an appointment had ever been made to come to my property. I laughed and said, yes, yesterday was the appointment. She apologized for not knowing but indicated she was ""trying to get them organized"" or something to that effect. I said someone had been to the property but I did not have the work done. I would strongly recommend that members be wary of this company and if you contract for them to do any work, make sure they are able to do it before you do anything with them. And since then, I have talked to other plaster contractors and they all indicated the ceiling could be repaired. I have since had the repair made for much less than $1,000"
5,The job was done professionally in a timely manner and they were happy to work around scheduling constraints. Mark communicated with me throughout the job with updates and timelines and they were able to finish this large job quickly. I would definitely hire them again.
1,I tried reaching the contractor four time. He never returned any of my calls. I tried over a period of two weeks. Very unprofessional
3,"It was okay. First of all, it said, ""$99 for three hours of work."" However, they don't tell you that they would bring two people out and that it's split. So, basically it was an hour and a half for $99, with two guys and it also includes them going to get the material. So, that took us 45 minutes. So basically, we paid $99 for 45 minutes. It took them, in addition, three hours to complete the project. So, I don't think I would use them again. It was cheaper than if you got a carpenter to do it. But, another thing; halfway through it, he was committed to another project. So he had to leave. I said, ""Wait a minute. You've got half of it done. When can you come back?"" He said, ""Oh, I don't know. You'll have to speak to my boss and draw up a schedule."" I said, ""No. That's not right. You're half done here. You don't leave this job to go to another job,"" which he did. But I begged him and he came back Saturday and finished it up. But, he was rushing through it. So, he didn't do it the way he should have done it. So, most likely, I won't use them again. The price was pretty decent. It was $400 to rebuild a wall. But, the whole thing was just not handled properly. I think saying, ""$99 for three hours of work,"" you should put in there that they're bringing two people and then that split up and then also that you have to pay to go get the materials. What I had to do was, drive with them and go pay for the materials. That took us 45 minutes. So, basically we're paying $99 for 45 minutes work, which was nothing more than tearing the old stuff off. The work was decent. He is just a handyman but he really tried his best. I think these guys are under the gun and they overbook them. That's what he said to me. He said, ""When they put out these specials, we're running around mad."" He said, ""I feel bad. I was rushing to get it done under the time. I didn't do it how I wanted to do it."" So, he even mentioned that he was stressed out. Another thing was, they don't take any of the trash. I had four or five bags of stuff that I had to carry out myself to the trash the following Tuesday. So they don't take any of that with them either. The guy was pretty decent and mannerly. I watched him the whole time. He wasn't snarky about that."
5,I provided a plywood sheet and the screws. They cut the plywood and installed it were I wanted. They were on time and professional. Overall a good transaction.
3,"I spoke with someone at the shop ahead of time to make sure they clearly understood what the job was and whether they would need any additional supplies, etc. I told her I had this same thing done in a different room of the house that was approximately the same size and it took 2 guys --- non-professionals --- only about 2 or 3 hours to complete the entire project. The woman was very pleasant and said they had all the info and supplies they needed and just wanted to confirm the time. The day of the scheduled appointment, one carpenter showed up. It became obvious within a matter of seconds that he was told nothing about the job and had no idea what he was hired to do. After I explained what I wanted done --- vinyl plank flooring installed in one small-ish room --- the first words out of his mouth were, ""I hate installing these things."" The second thing out of his mouth was, ""There is no way I can finish this in one day. This is going to take at least 2 days to complete it."" I was not off to a good start. Long story short, he did wind up completing the job in one day. It took about 7 hours, so it wasn't cheap. And after the rocky start, the carpenter did loosen up and was very nice. He also worked very hard to get the project completely in one day. As far as the results, he did a very nice job fitting the planks together evenly and correctly, and at a glance the flooring looks very nice. However, he did a very shoddy job around the corners and edges of all doorways, stairs, and fireplace. He did not remove the bottom trim of the baseboards in order to slide the planks underneath them, resting 5/16th of an inch from the wall like you are supposed to. I also made sure the representative I spoke with on the phone understood this and she said it would be no problem. So after this, I had to hire a separate carpenter to come and replace all the baseboards and trim, because the uneven and jagged edges of the flooring butting up against the wall looked awful. And since then, I've still been using brown calking, paint, and pieces of floor transitions in attempt to hide all the mistakes and gaping holes around the fireplace and entryway. Bottom line is you get what you pay for. I found the ""best"" (i.e. cheapest) deal on Angie's List, and the job was completed in one day. I wasn't expecting a miracle worker, nor did I get one. Next time tough I'll gladly pay an extra couple hundred bucks to do a better job. I still can't get over the fact that I had 2 non-professional guys install the same flooring in another room that was approximately the same size, and they finished it in 2-3 hours and it looks immaculate, yet it took this service an entire working day to simply finish it and the quality wasn't even half as good. Oh well... You get what you pay for."
4,"When the representative called me to set up the service, I realized that I hadn't understood the details of the deal and it was not going to work for us -- timing and the need to purchase our own materials made it not as appealing to us. I received a refund from Angie's List. The House Doctors were courteous and helpful as I realized this wasn't going to work for us at this time."
3,I called them and the problem was not rectified. They said someone would come out and no one did.
5,"Great job!!! The house is old and the front porch needed repairs. Several pieces has rotted, cracked, and broke off. The new wood was cut evenly and placed in sturdy, interlocking pieces. I was amazed that as much of the porch was able to be repaired within the time frame of 3 hours. I will definitely have more work done on the porch. The carpenter was professional, polite, and did a great job. Thank you House Doctors.......I highly recommend you!"
5,"Mark was prompt, very polite, and cleaned up after the job"
1,I called the company and left a message. A woman called back the next day and set up an appointment for the following week on Friday (9/11/2015) between 1:00 and 3:00. I stayed home Friday afternoon waiting for the person to come. At 5:00 I called the company and left a message that no one showed up for the appointment. This is Monday afternoon and still no contact. I wasted half a day waiting for the contractor to show up!
3,Not as expected
5,"The painters came for parts of several days and worked steadily even on some hot days. At the last minute, my husband asked them to do another window and the trim on the corner (which he thought we had requested earlier). They had to come back another day to finish up. The men were very professional and polite and friendly. It is nice to have all of these jobs done."
5,On time (within a set 2 hour window). Did the job. Will need to come back to complete the ceiling repairs though. The mud needed additional time to dry before it was ready to retexture. I will hire again.
3,hired to power wash home. they contact you via email and give you a telephone number to call to make appointment. the number is completely unmanned and getting in contact with them was extremely difficult and when I did they notified me they were booking months out...................
5,"Mark was amazing. He was so conscientious and professional I thought for sure he was the owner (he is not). When the job was completed quickly he offered to paint the area he repaired!! So grateful, otherwise I am sure the wall would not have been painted for weeks! Scheduling was a ""pain"" but now I know it was so worth it. Kim, the scheduler, was a delight."
5,"They responded to my appointment request promptly, showed up on time and completed the work in an efficient and professional manner. I would hire them again to perform other work at my home."
4,"I bought the 3 hrs of service thru Angie's List, but didn't need 3 hrs of work--just wanted to get the job done ASAP. The contractor was prompt, personable and worked efficiently. I had removed water damaged baseboards, drywall, and wallpaper well away from the repair area, but the repair guy extended the drywall mud onto areas that still had wallpaper--making it difficult for me to sand and prep the whole section for new wallpaper. He cut new baseboards using the previous baseboard pieces to match, but they were more than 1/4"" off when I went to reinstall them. So I took the original pieces to a lumberyard and had new pieces cut to the same angles. Guess what? The lumberyard also cut them incorrectly. I finally trimmed them myself with a miter box and undercut by 1/8"" -- and filled the gap w/caulk. Contractor did a nice job caulking shower stall -- clean and professional looking and very quick. Overall, responsive service and a good price, but medium quality. Like many handymen, they know what they're doing, but you still need to direct and inspect so you don't end up with additional tasks."
4,Don't remember details (it's been 2+years since service).
5,I bought a $100 coupon for 3 hours of drywall work from 1 Drywaller. Instead of 1 guy 2 showed up and completed the work in a little over an hour. Initially I was charged a full hour for the work going about 10 minutes past the hour. I notified the Secretary that although I paid I didn't think I should be charged the full amount of $85 extra. The company owner learned of this and was good enough to return my $85 which I think is very professional. The work and price were great. No complaints. Would recommend. Tom
5,"On time. Professional, courteous. I would use again and highly recommend,"
1,Purchased Certificate online and could not get a hold of company for over four weeks. Called Angieslist and they cancelled the purchase (approximate cost of service: $99.00)
5,They did an excellent job and even did the stucco. I would use them again.
4,"They did a great job of quickly repairing the damage. They put down drop clothes and swept up the area pretty well. I think they did a great job. However, it took the company a week or more to get back with me to schedule an appointment."
5,Mike came this morning and I showed him what work needed to be done. He got right to work and was very skilled. I am very impressed with the work he did. It's not even noticeable that there was a huge hole in my wall! I have used The House Doctors before and will definitely use them again.
5,"Responded on time, and came with an assistant. Appointment delayed a half-hour and kept. Worked hard and completed by afternoon. Repaired and replaced several posts and a number of pickets. Worked hard to keep my materials cost down, and cleaned up well. Highly recommend."
5,"Job was partially completed as Deal was for three hours and tech was at end of day. Very neat, thorough, and informative tech. Waiting for an estimate to complete repairs."
1,"The worker showed up, my wife explained that we wanted the walls in the garage repaired, he said that the cracks would likely return despite his work. That's all fine, but he ignored most of the walls and was not here for anywhere close to three hours. The parts he did were fair at best. This deal was a total waste."
5,"Excellent work timely, cleaned up courteous very professional!"
5,I needed to call as the prior scheduler failed to follow-through. When I explained the situation the new scheduler was very responsive and the technician who performed the work was diligent. I would use them again
4,"Went well....it was a deal from angies list....my only complaint was that I took the deal on May 5th, but the earliest they could complete the service was June 25th or so. Long time to wait for service to be preformed."
1,"I shopped a coupon from Angie's list for $99 for three hours of general carpentry work. I thought that it would be good enough to put on a single wood panel on the exterior wall and repair a small area of deck. I waited one week before a lady called me to schedule a time. She told me that I had to get all the materials ready myself. After two more weeks, a guy showed up with a compact car. He apparently did not even have a ladder to do the work. Instead, he tried to give you a lot of reasons that much more work would be needed and came up with a cost estimate in the amount of $2000. This is a scam. I would never recommend to buy any coupon from this company."
3,"I had great difficulty scheduling as House Doctors did not respond to my repeated phone calls or emails. IJob was originally scheduled for June 11, and after waiting for hours, it was finally cancelled due to earlier job taking too long. Rescheduling was again very difficult. I would have cancelled but it was now past 30 days so I contacted Angies List for help. After my call to An gies List I heard back from House Doctors quickly and scheduled job for several weeks later.,as there were only 2 dates available. Job itself was done well, quickly and efficiently."
2,"There was no initial contact for months because they were very hard to reach. After several phone calls and emails someone finally called back and said they could not give me a service date because they had so many customers respond to the deal. So, I patiently waited several months for them to contact me which they never did so I contacted them again. I finally reached the owner who said he was going on vacation and to talk to his son. I reached the son who gave me another number to call to talk to another guy. At that point I no longer had any interest in their services because I felt they were totally unorganized and overbooked."
1,"They didn't provide any services. I got a refund from Angie's List. After I bought the deal, I spoke with people over and they said that they would come the first day to make an estimate and let us know what would be involved in the project and then they would come back and add in the hours that we had purchased plus any additional time plus materials. That sounded all very good. Then when they came over, seven weeks later, because that was the first time that they were available to come over, the guy came with an assignment to do the job and asked me if I had all of the materials. I didn't know what the job entailed and I didn't know what materials were needed. He then told me that the time that he was there right then was part of the time that we had purchased. I said that there had been some kind of mistake. Then I spoke with his manager and we decided that it would be in both of our best interest just to cancel the deal. That's what we did. There was no way that I was going to be able to trust them to do the work after there was such a misunderstanding. I made that very clear to them that I did not want them to do the work if this is how they were going to work with me. He claimed that it was a misunderstanding and I still didn't want them. Now, I'm sitting here with the work still needing to be done and I need to find someone to do it."
3,"The service person arrived on time but seemed surprised that my cracks could not easily filled with spackling compound but needed to be taped and covered with drywall compound. The first 30 minutes was wasted on him lecturing on what he could do and not do. Finally, I asked him to do the best he could when repairing the cracks. My reason for having him repair the cracks was to see if that would solve my problem or if they would just reappear. I also was being lazy as I could have done it but thought it would be easier to have someone else do it. Once he started he did an okay job that the cracks will need to be sanded and another coat of dry wall compound will be required. I had hope that is first coat have been smoother then what I could have done so extra sanding would be minimum. He also did not tape all of the crack so those cracks reappeared. Lastly, I thought he over charged me for the additional supplies he used but I thought it would be useless to argue with him."
5,Would use again. Very courteous.
5,Excellent. Michael was the most professional worker that I have ever experienced. He was so polite and did an A plus job on my driveway.He asked to use my bathroom and as you can imagine his feet were wet .I saw him clean up my bathroom floor. The driveway and sidewalks look great. I will definitely use The House Soctors again.
1,"The company gave me estimates for replacement of areas, but doesn't repair lathe and plaster ceilings.. How can I get a refund of $198.00."
2,I wouldn't bother trying to work with them if you value your own time.
1,"I paid for the ""Deal"" (3hours of plaster work for $99) on June 23 ,2015 order #2082155. I selected a day June 24, 2015 for service and mentioned I am available almost any day. No one came on June 24. House Doctors asked for my phone number on June 23, 2015 and I sent the information on June 24. I wasn't able to contact House Doctors. During the period from June 23, 2015 through September 3, 2015 I contacted Angie's List about this problem at least four times. Finally after 2 months an appointment to do the work was made for August 26, 2015, 10-12AM. Two workers came to my house, Mark and a assistant. They said they didn't have time to do the job. They did tell me that the dry wall job would cost an additional $475. To paint the interior of my house they said the cost would be $2300 and I would have to pay for the paint. Mark said they would clear this price with their boss and email me a contract. They left, no drywall work completed. After contacting Angie's list again I did hear from the House Doctors secretary on September 2, 2015. She asked me to repeat most of the details of my dealing with House Doctors. I repeated most of the details stated above. No appointment was made to do the work. On September 3 2015 I contacted Angie's List to ask for a refund and cancel my ""Deal"" with House Doctors. Jon was very helpful and also renewed my membership. My ratings above reflect my true feelings about this ""Deal"". This Company might do good work. After waiting more than 60 days nothing has been accomplished at my house. Without Angie's list I would have had no contact with this Company"
1,"I bought 3 hours of drywall/plaster repair about 3 weeks ago. I have called & emailed repeatedly. I got one email response, asking for my contact info which I had provided multiple times. I'm working on getting a refund. I would not use these people. Very poor customer service."
5,"The crew removed all of the 45 year old, broken, and crumbling concrete in a very quick fashion, and cleaned up the debris very nicely. Next, the crew replace the entire garage floor, the big patio, and the entrance foyer, and custom-stamped the foyer and patio to look like natural stone surfaces. After the garage, patio, and foyer cured, the crew quickly did the entire driveway, and within a few days we were able to use all of the new surfaces with no problems. After the concrete cured, the crew returned and sealed all of the new surfaces to ensure long life and good looks. Very good experience."
4,"They did a good job at power washing. Only complaint I have is they don't call you back. I left 4 messages with in 5 days and never got a call. Disappointed in the time frame for them to come out, as well as they didn't call for a week once I bought the coupon. I wish they would at least call people back. Otherwise the deck looked good."
5,Showed up with two guys. One was an expert one was younger. They worked well together. They got all of the things done I needed. I will have them back to do more work.
1,they charged me and never did the work ignoring my calls BUYERS BEWARE
5,Showed up on time. Surveyed the job. Went out and obtained supplies and promptly returned and completed the job.
5,Good communication and really nice people.
1,HE never came. His office said that he was very busy.
5,went very well. very professional. carpenter was professional and hard working. also provided information on another job.
4,"The job itself went great, and they did a few other things. They were clean, professional and did a wonderful job. They told me that the texture wouldn't be the same as the rest of the ceiling. The ceiling dried and it was flat with little texture. A few months later someone else came to look at it and remarked that it wasn't a great job and that they should make it better. I called them back to say it needed to be re-textured. Mike the owner said they'd schedule someone for Memorial Day - I called them back and asked them if they wanted to schedule on a holiday. They didn't so they had to reschedule. They never called me back - I called them again, they didn?t call me back. I tried calling the owner and he said he would schedule it himself. I never heard from them since. I was going to use them for a number of projects and they haven?t been very responsive. However if they would like to respond to this issue I would love for them to complete the work."
4,"It went well. the only reason I had this service provided was two fold, one he was offering a special for xx hours of work, and second I was recoving from surgery from cancer. I am a handy man around the house, and have all the tools....it's just hard to reach up when you have 70 stiches...."
5,"Had hole / crumbling ceiling between 1st and 2nd level. Eric came in, cut out the hole, examined it and identify where the leak was coming from (toilet on 2nd floor, I had already fixed it). He talked me through everything that had happened, what to expect and what he would do. He then repaired the hole, added additional security to the ceiling where it was loose, and added texture that looked identical to the rest of the kitchen. He did an amazing job, got it done in less than 3 hours and went above and beyond to educate me and talk through things. Because of his excellent work, I will call these guys again for future jobs. Thank you Eric!"
5,"Jim arrived within the allotted time-frame. He was pleasant/professional & from start-to-finish was 3 hours & 15 minutes. He stated the front door trim wasn't rotted, but the crumbling side door threshold was obviously in need of replacement. Jim took a loose paint-chip from the side door trim to the nearby Sherwin Williams to match (wish he'd had done the same from the front door & side door's threshold which need painting) & also to Home Depot for a 2x8x8 + a 2x4x8 pressure treated wood, caulk & other supplies. Jim declined my offer to assist. Pros: He removed the side door storm/screen, rotted threshold & small portions of the door jamb. He fashioned new door jamb pieces & the threshold from the 2x8, caulked everything & re-installed the storm/screen He caulked the bottoms of the front door trim & looks like he applied a light coat of wood filler to the dried/cracked trim (though I had to buy more wood filler to complete the pre-painting prep). The 2x4x8 was used to replace rotted/horizontal spacers & then reattach 2 fence slats. He also reattached 2 other fence slats. He used screws I offered/supplied. He cleaned-up most of the debris. He verbally said the materials cost $55.00, which I paid him in cash. Cons: Seems the side door's threshold is lower than the original as the storm/screen door doesn't ""seal"" at the bottom when closed - which I didn't discover until after he left. I completed cleaning/swept his work-area of sawdust from the driveway. I had asked for the Sherwin-Williams & Home Depot receipts for my records & though replied ""No"" when he asked if I wanted change from the $55.00, after he left I realized he bought screws for the job. The receipts totaled $47.89 & he didn't leave the screws he bought for the job. Bottom line is I'm happy the threshold's been replaced so commenting (above) just for the record/review."
1,Very unprofessional not to even call
5,It went well - Mark called to notify us that he was on the way. When he got here - he took care to lay down plastic to protect the floors from the plaster. He spent a good deal of time working the mud to get it just right - and we are very excited to finally have that area finished and ready for paint. Very professional and courteous - great job Mark. The only reason I gave a B on responsiveness was because when the service was scheduled the service rep did not explain to me that I should have joint compound here for Mark to use - would have been good to know in advance of the work. Otherwise - very pleased with the service.
3,They got about half the taping competed that I would have expected to be done.
5,"repaired a problem i was having on my roof which was causing damage to a ceiling, took out and replaced part of the ceiling"
1,I called last week and still no return call.
1,I have called them 7 times with no response back. I will never do business again.
5,That's what he did and it was a big deal purchase.
1,They are very difficult to get hold of.
5,"They did a real nice job in our kitchen. Painted, cleaned and it's really nice."
3,"They missed the first appointment by an hour and called to reschedule. When they came, it was two fellows for 1 1/2 hours as opposed to a workman for 3 hours as the Big Deal said. The work I needed done did not require 2 men. The work they did cracked badly by the next day. I was told by the next contractor I hired to repair it, that the 'mud' was put on too thickly. I will NOT call them again."
2,They don't have any openings until July I wanted the service done sooner then that.
5,It turned out well. He did good work and cleaned-up after themselves well. They're very versatile company that offers several different services. I've used them for several different things. They've always done good work.
5,"The jobs went very well. They replaced 4 window sills and a 3 sided bay window sill that had rotted. They also took out the bottom six or more inches of the boards going up the side of the window sill. The first day they only did the bottom of the sills and when I took pictures and asked why the sides where not replaced as discussed during the initial walk through they just hadn't gotten to that part of job. It was nice that they didn't try to back track from the walk through explanation of what was included in the quote or that they didn't get defensive with my questions. Just gave a quick explanation and we all moved forward. The sills were all caulked into placed I am very happy with the finished product. The rotted/broken wood siding they replaced looks great as well. Very happy. The floor joist in the basement is also very secure now. during the walkthrough it was explained that they would try to sister a board from beam to beam. Due to the all the extra clutter in the basement (it is 145 year old house) there was no way to effectively secure the new sister to the beam without removing wiring/other boards/ductwork/plumbing. They put a 6 foot board on each side of the broken joist and secured to one beam and the joist. The repair looks very secure and I am happy with the work. Once again, I called with questions because at fist the end result did not look like what I was expecting and got a quick response and reasoning. No complaints and I am happy. So overall a very good experience and I would use them again. The ""B"" for responsiveness is because sometimes they can be a little slow to respond to phone calls at the beginning. But they are a busy company and produce at a high level, so I feel like a made a good decision to stay with them and this review should help with new customers who might get a little impatient to know the wait can be worth it. At the end Mike was very responsive, so I think it was probably more of a seasonal issue than anything else and like I said, I would definitely use them again."
5,"Service person arrived promptly and was shown items to be completed. He installed door and door knob using the the items I had previously purchased. He repaired the bi-fold door and removed the pantry door, shaved the bottom so it no longer sticks, and re-installed the door. He cleaned up after himself and left."
3,"The guy was quick, friendly, and did a decent job filling in the holes / cracks. But he left little globs of drywall mud all over my newly refinished wood floors. I really wish he'd have cleaned up better after he was done. Now I have to go around trying to remove those spots without damaging my floors. Pretty bummed out about it."
1,They are very hard to deal with. Not customer friendly!
5,"Couldn't be happier, great service, cleaned up when done and did an overall excellent job."
5,He did a good job. He was very friendly and helpful.
5,All of the work was very professionally completed. Clean up was also great.
5,"We had used The House Doctors previously to rebuild my hot water heater chimney when it was almost ready to fall through our porch roof (they did a great job). At the time, they also quoted us for putting a tub surround. At the time, we didn't have the money, so we put it off for a year. One year later, we decided to completely renovate the bathroom down to the studs. We called The House Doctors, and they promptly came out to give us an estimate (I would recommend calling them about two months before you want the service done ? their schedule fills up quite quickly). We were quoted a price and given a timeline of one to 1.5 weeks to completion. Mark came out and completely demolished the entire bathroom (noisy but effective). Then they came and hung new drywall. The rest of the project was ready to proceed. We had four workers out throughout the project: Project Manager Mike, his son Mike Jr., his nephew Mark and his daughter Steve. All of them were polite, dealt well with my overly friendly lab/collie mix (they are dog people). The only part of the project we questioned was their ability to start on time. Personally, we would have liked to have seen them start even earlier (I work from home and am up at 5:20 am each morning. I'm not suggesting 6 am, but 8 am would have been OK), but we all agreed on 10:30 am start time. For the most part, they showed up around 11 am and were usually done by 4:30 pm. While they were here, they worked like dogs, but we feel if they'd started even an hour earlier in the morning, the project could have been done by the estimated time (they finished the job in approximately two weeks). In the grand scheme of things, this is a minor complaint. The rest of their work was stellar. Our house was built in 1927, which means it is.......quirky to say the least. Our bathtub (which we kept) was two inches smaller than standard tubs now. The plumbing for the sink was in a weird place. But the project manager Mike is so skilled at so many things, he dealt with each challenge as it came up with cheerful resignation. Even better, he SOLVED all the problems with little fuss or muss. He is really a master at what he does, and I can't recommend him highly enough. For example, given that this was our only bathroom, they worked in such a way that we were never without a toilet. At first we used the one upstairs, but then Project Manager Mike had the brilliant idea of moving the old toilet downstairs (the basement) to replace another non-functioning one. This was critically important to us, and it helped our household of 3 keep from losing our minds. PM Mike installed ceramic tile on the floor, up the front of the tub (did I mention our house is quirky?) to replace some horrible, ugly tile already there, and around the base of the walls. We had trouble with ceramic tile a few years ago with another contractor (we eventually had to go with linoleum because of the problems ? which were contractor caused), but PM Mike's expertise made the installation a breeze. No problems here. Part of the original quote was refinishing our bathtub, which had been destroyed in a hydrochloric acid accident 17 years ago (don't ask). Unfortunately, their regular tub refinisher was stuck doing hotel jobs in Columbus. Owner Mike Vecchio (yeah, that was confusing) took money off because they couldn't complete it, recommended another refinisher and, when the quote from that contractor came in higher than expected, Owner Mike volunteered to pay the difference. Our overall experience with The House Doctors was pretty amazing, and we would recommend them to anyone who needs home renovations done. We would definitely use them again."
3,They did the work the best way they know how.
5,"The craftsmen were so thorough and meticulous. The repair was so perfect. We couldn't see where the damage had even been. They worked swiftly and neatly. They cleaned up the work area perfectly. No dust was to be found anywhere, even after they sanded the repair areas! As an additional bonus, they helped bring in groceries from my car! That was "" the cherry on top""! I would highly recommend them to anyone."
5,Purchased a 3 hour drywall repair coupon from House Doctors on weekend and was contacted on Monday with scheduled day and time. The drywall in my son's bedroom was expertly repaired so that my husband could paint it. Great job and great price.
3,"The contractor did a fine job. He actually finished all the work under the allotted three hours, but since he did everything so efficiently I thought that the $99 Angie's deal was money well spent. He even installed a three-switch light panel for me. Update: Subsequent calls to this contractor have gone unanswered, despite several attempts by me to contact them. I don't know if they are having some sort of a business-related problem, but I can no longer justify giving them the 'A' rating I had given them for their previous work."
1,I have tried to contact them about 3 times leaving a voicemail each time. As of today I still have not heard back from them. For this reason I am requesting a refund.
1,"I never wanted to have my house painted. When they showed up on March 3rd, I believed that they were bringing me an estimate for the work I had requested. They did bring a signed contract explaining that I had hired them for a painting project that also included some dining room work to replace some plasterboard. The plasterboard in the dining room was the only piece of non-painting work they did. I did not want to have the interior of my house painted and that is all they came to do. My daughter is blind. There were two rooms where she could have put her hand against the wall but they had left the wiring completely exposed. They didn't replace the protective coverings that had covered our electrical outlets which was extremely dangerous. This is contrary to what I had expected from them. Since the work has been done I have been told by several people who have seen my home that I had overpaid for my services and they couldn't imagine how I was so gullible. I feel that I was taken advantage of."
5,"The gentleman, Mark, was very knowledgeable. His work was very neat. He provided information we needed to prevent further water damage."
5,"Arrived 1 hr, 20 min late without calling to notify me. Stated upon arrival that they ""got lost."" But got to work as soon as they arrived and worked hard for entire 3 hours. House looked really good when finished. There was an issue with the coupon to begin with. No one contacted me to schedule the service, as stated, and when I finally called, I was told the coupon had expired, but they ""would allow it."""
5,"Mike did, as always, an excellent job. The House Doctors always do an excellent job. They are dependable and responsive. The quality of their work is always good. If there ever is a problem, they always fix it."
4,We had scheduling issues. I had to have lights put in first before the drywall could be done. I called Angie's List to get a refund.
3,Tried to get the work done and they have contacted me once but nothing came from it. Therefore I?m going with someone else to do the work.
3,"This is the second time I used this service thru Angie's and I'm not sure if it was the same person, but it did cost the same and their washer doesn't reach high enough to get all the way up the side of my house."
4,"Took out approximately 3 foot by 4 foot section of damaged plaster wall down to studs, replaced with drywall. I had to supply the drywall and all supplies. I had to pay Lowe's to deliver the dry wall because it wouldn't fit into my car. This was an unexpected complication and the delivery was an unexpected expense. The worker was pleasant to work with and did a good job. I am satisfied with the result."
2,"I purchased the deal in May of 2014 and attempted to contact the provider intermittently by both e-mail and telephone for the next month or so to no avail (they rarely answered the phone and responded to e-mails mainly by giving me the phone number where I left voice-mails that did not elicit a return call). I became frustrated and also busy with other things. When I attempted to get a refund later in the summer, I was told by Angie's List that the deadline for doing so had passed. They suggested contacting the House Doctors again, which I did. After many attempts, I finally got a return phone call and scheduled a date for the work in early November. They canceled at the last minute but sent someone over the following week. He was not informed that I had paid for three hours of work and had only an hour before his next appointment. He put a couple of finishing nails into the bannister near the top that helped a bit but not enough to satisfy the people who bought the house so it became a sticking point in the negotiations. The carpenter promised to come back to replace the door frame (which was entirely exterior) but never did. Overall, I was very disappointed with my experience."
5,It went very well. Mike did everything we needed done and everything works.
5,All went very well. We have not had any leaks.
5,"He arrived on time called to let me know what time he would be here. Got here and got right to work, worked on door first did a great job even painted the frame once repaired. He then worked on the drawers. Clean up and left after the 3 hours."
4,"It didn’t go as well as I’d have hoped. They left in the middle of the job and came back. It didn’t get done as well as it could’ve been done. I had them do the work in the kitchen, the hallway, and some living room work."
1,"Company response This was a real bad day because we got hung up on another person's job which made us real late for this customer. We are human too and we would like to extend a heartfelt apology to this customer. Sincerely, Bob Vecchio P.S. WE tried to re-schedule for another day but she said no. Company response HAVE TO SAY THIS. THIS REPORT IS A STRAIGHT OUT LIE. THIS CUSTOMER WAS SCHEDULED FOR THURSDAY SEPT.18TH NOT SEPT. 11TH. CUSTOMER CALLED AND ASKED WHERE WE WERE AND MIKE TOILD HER THAT SHE WAS SCHEDULED FOR THE FOLLOWING THURSDAY. SHE DENIED IT BUT AS A CUSTOMER SERVICE; MIKE OFFERED TO SEND SOMEBODY OUT LATER THAT DAY OR TODAY; SEPT 12TH AND SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW IT. SHE WAS HOSTILE AND MORE THAN UNREASONABLE AND I DON'T MIND SAYING IT. THANKS FOR READING AND UNDERSTANDING. I SWEAR ON A STACK OF BIBLES THAT WHAT I JUST WROTE IS TRUE. THANK YOU, BOB VECCHIO Company Response: WRONG NUMBER--BOO--NOT TRUE JUST A VERY SPITEFUL RESPONSE. GLAD HE'S MOVING ON. Company Response: This is a total lie. He received a type written estimate in the US Mail. John Bailey ( my employee ) met with his wife. John is in his late 20's and is a ""Union Mason"" This customer better stick to his full time job because he sure as heck isn't a comedian. My God; we did everything right. Thanks for reading my reply a nd understanding. Bob V. Company Response: My wife was hospitalized for over a week and that's why response was slow. Hope this person Understands!!!! Company Response: IF THIS REALLY HAPPENED; WE APOLOGIZE TO THIS CUSTOMER. IT RARELY HAPPENS THAT SOMETHING SLIPS BY US; BUT WE'RE HUMAN TOO. ""TO ERR IS HUMAN"" PLEASE SEE AND NOTE THAT WE HAVE OVER 1,300 ANGIES LIST REPORTS; FAR EXCEEDING OTHER COMPANIES. WE STRIVE TO PUT A SMILE :) ON EVERY CUSTOMERS' FACES. PLEASE GIVE US A TRY. SINCERELY, BOB V. Company Response: We tried to save a little time by giving this customer a verbal quote since we couldn't get out to see them just as quickly as they wanted/needed. We tried but sorry that we couldn't connect. we try very hard to be all things to all people and sometimes you just can't. Bob V."
4,They were good. I had them to work in the basement office. One tech showed up to do the work; he showed up on time and worked the whole time. I had to pay extra for a few materials.
3,"The workers were nice however, the price was a bit high and the quality work was not what we were expecting."
5,I was very impressed with the workers technical skills and Efficiency in how he completed the job. We would definitely hire them again.
5,"Had a hiccup with the pressure washer and repair / replace the unit causing a delay. I did not realize that soap was not part of the package. Overall, he did a nice job. I was pleased with the outcome. The service provider was polite and prompt."
5,It turned out really good. They did a nice job. There were two people here doing the work. They arrived on time for the appointment and scheduling was good.
5,"Was generally happy with the patching, the larger area didn't turn out quite as smooth as I was hoping although it was a large area that had been cutout so maybe my expectations were too high. Had I noticed it before they left I'm sure they would have addressed it though."
5,"I received an email within a couple of hours of purchasing the coupon. I was a little taken aback when I called the number that came in the email as it was a generic phone company message with no name or company ID provided, but it was the right number and a couple of days later I got a call to set up the appointment., I think it was 1 days from the day I purchased the coupon until they performed the service. I am very happy with the work."
2,"We bought an Angie's list deal for 3 hours of wall repair for $90 with the intent of having the contractor repair some cracks in our plaster, exposed after wallpaper removal. I left three messages for the company, twice with a contact that ""wasn't the right person to talk to"". After two weeks, I finally heard back from the appropriate individual and they could not schedule anything until the middle of May (2.5 months out). This was completely unacceptable to us. This is not about the contractor: We requested a refund and Angie's list staff told us that they were going to try to find an alternate contractor to complete the work. This process took months and we finally just asked for--and were granted--a refund. These big deals should only be offered by highly rated contractors with available to do the work in short order after the deal has been purchased. This was a terrible experience all around."
1,"They were horrible, he gave me a quote and did an average job. Then when he gave me the bill it was about $800.00 more than he had quoted."
4,The service was ok. They had very good scheduling and availability.
3,"It was fine though there seemed to be lots of glue involved for a carpentry project. Cabinet has held we'll, though. It took several days for him to call me back."
5,The job was done in two days. I had to purchase all the materials and pay separately. The job was billed hourly but I would have preferred an estimate to stick to the price not knowing how long it would take. It took longer than I thought it would since the installer was not here from 9 to 5.
5,"Mark T. was the repairman/ drywall carpenter that came to my house from House Doctors. Very professional, and easy to work with...He repaired the drywall damage to better than new status, and I am very pleased with the results. I definitely will call House Doctors for future repair and house maintenance! Thank You!"
1,"We kept trying to set up an appointment. We finally set a date and time. He was supposed to arrive at 10am and I had to call him at 1pm and he said “was I supposed to do yours today?” He said he would be right out, but I had to call him back 3-4 times asking him where he was and he said the job he was at was taking longer than expected. 4pm hit and he said we would have to re-schedule, but I said no because I had already taken that whole day off for him! I didn’t trust him to come out."
5,It looks great. I would use this provider again in the future.
5,The provider came out this morning and said I should call to get a refund because the kind of work I need done is weather dependent and they recommended doing it in June or July.
5,"Finished product was good, but 99 dollars of plastering does not go very far especially when more mud needs to be purchased from Sherwin Williams and the travel time 1/2 hour from my home is included in the length of the service call. Also, prepping the area and clean up afterwards is part of the time frame."
4,"It was okay. It was a little more expensive than I thought or than they estimated. They were fine. They came in and did an estimate. I guess they didn't figure it out and everything so there's a little more that they had to do. Other than the cost, they were professional."
5,The crafts man arrived on time. I didn't have the drywall so he graciously offers to go to Home Depot to purchase some which I paid for. It was only $20. He worked very efficiently and it only took about two hours. I'm very pleased with The House Doctors and would hire them again.
5,"They did a professional job, unlike what other providers had planned to do. Rather than dig a new hole in a different location they removed the old post stump left from the original post that had snapped off at the ground. They also installed it to the proper depth of about 36"", below the frost-line. It was concreted in and sealed to deter eventual breakdown between post and concrete. These guys were not a couple of hacks. They knew the right way to do this particular job, not just the ""quick and dirty the homeowner will never know"" way. And they did it the right way. I very much appreciated the professionalism and respect, of me and my home, that this provider demonstrated. For this, and quality of work, I will enthusiastically consider them for future work."
5,"Christian & Bob were awesome. Not only did they complete my crazy punch list, but noted several items I MISSED that I should have had on the list...in a ""we noticed"", way, not a ""you should"", way. Though it took a while to get us all on the same schedule page, (good for them - they are very BUSY!!!), once we connected, I felt as though I was the only customer they had. THAT is good business. Thanks, House Doctors!"
4,"My thought was that the fascia was just loose, but it turns out the stucco on my house was not ""sealed"" and rain run-off was seeping into the fascia and rotting the wood. Significantly more repairs were needed. I very much appreciated the advice the technician gave me.... and in the short term, he was able to close the opening in the board -- where rodents were entering. I was a little disappointed in the cost estimate I received a few weeks later. It was higher than it should have been and was presented in a manner that implied I better ""fix it now."" A little too much ""pressure"". They caulked the window flashing....but used white caulk on brown flashing and told me afterward! I had brown caulk they could have used In general, this job went okay, but I think vendors see these small opportunities as loss-leaders to get their foot in the door."
5,It was good. They did a good job. The only thing was they ran out of mud and used ours. They left the lid off the mud so we lost that bucket of mud.
4,path was rough and the company wanted more to complete the work
5,"ng on Angie's List, everything went according to plan. An appointment was made, and although we were not present at the time of service, it was performed as promised. I am blind and therefore cannot personally rate the quality of the job, but my wife said that it was fine.After some initial confusion, since the house I wanted to be washed was not the address I was usi"
5,"House Doctors pressure-washing made the back yard patio come alive again! Job included doing the landing step that surrounded the glassed/screened in porch and the shady sidewalk that lead to the front yard?on all sides, the view is pristine now. Great job, would use again."
5,"It went well. Installer went with me to buy the materials I wanted, then come home and installed it all."
5,"Work was done, pleased with service. Big deal was somewhat limited in what they could do. Overall pleased."
4,The provider called within 48 hours to schedule the appointment. They showed up on time and worked diligently for 3 hours to pressure wash my patio and driveway. The whole process went smoothly and I was very pleased.
4,The gentleman got everything done that I needed to so he did a good job. I thought they were a tiny bit overpriced but he did a good job overall.
5,The House Doctors showed up as scheduled and did a great job cleaning the siding on our house. I wasn't home at the time they showed up but they did everything as expected.
3,Did not come on time Had to buy supplies .took lunch on my time did not complete job..Ran out of nails
2,Extremely slow response and had to get the job done. It took almost a month to get a call back in the meantime I had to hire someone else.
5,"Excellent service. Timely, professional. Repair work was very well done."
1,"It looks worse than when we started. They didn't make plans to come and fix it. It was awful. We purchased the coupon in May. They've been unresponsive. They schedule dates that we don't agree with. They came out when they feel like it and not when we've made appointments for it. We've had different information when we talked to the company. With what they quoted us the other day, it was outrageous."
1,"Appointment scheduled for a month or more. One hour before arrival time, I receive a call that they would have to reschedule and that someone would call me back. I explained that was not satisfactory because I had arranged to take this day off, cancelled clients, moved court dates as well as rescheduled a deposition. I told the guy (last name Vecchio) who called that I wanted his boss to call me back within 5 minutes. I did get a call back but it was the from the same guy and he said he had to leave a message for another guy named Vecchio. One hour later still no returned call. I reviewed other reviews and this seems to be a common issue with this company. The company seems to then reply to a negative review by saying that since they have been in business 40 years and therefore you should not believe the review. I WANT A REFUND. THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE BANNED FRON ANGIES LIST. I WILL MAKE IT MY PERSONAL MISSION IN LIFE, THAT YEAR 40 WILL BE THEIR LAST YEAR IN BUSINESS. THIS IS IS THEFT. PLAIN AND SIMPLE."
1,"I was away from my office at the time of the call, when I got back in I called them right back to say the date they requested (11/14/14), I would not be available and could I please reschedule. She said that ""he would have to pull the cards again"" and would get back to me. I have called several times and left messages on their voice mail, but never received a call back. I have emailed and they have responded that they would get in touch with me, but still no contact. On the morning of 11/14/14, I received a call from one of their workmen that they were coming to my house that day. I explained to him that I had cancelled that appointment and asked to be rescheduled. He said, he would speak with them and they would call me. I still have not heard anything. I would like a refund. If it is this difficult to just get them to respond and to reschedule, I am apprehensive of how they will handle the job. I would like to request a refund."
3,"Representative said he couldn't do the work and that they would typically perform very basic tasks such as baseboards, door molding, small jobs in general. However, I need someone to install my finished cabinets."
5,It went really well. We went to Home Depot to pick out the supplies. He was extremely knowledgeable and professional. His craftsmanship was impeccable. He was also respectful when speaking to me and when he entered the house. I am very pleased and will use him in the near future. Ms. K
5,"Very clean, nice repair, done quickly, Everything cleaned up after the job, This plumbing project will now make it very easy to turn the faucet off, outside, for winter weather. The plumber came into the house, did the job, cleaned up, and left the house within 1/2 hour."
3,"Did not go well. House Doctors were to contact me by Oct. 21 and I called them many times and eventually someone called me back the first week of November. They were unable to schedule me until December and gave me many reasons why their staff were out sick etc. Bottom line, they could not perform the work."
3,The gentleman from The House Doctors said that he couldn't do the job that I needed done. He was polite. I felt like he gave up and didn't try.
1,"In the end, I was never able to have services completed and their lack of professionalism concerned me that the quality of their work might be similar. Had several large projects that needed to be completed and the provided clearly was unable to get organized. I wasnt going to provide a negative review since I personally was not negatively impacted (other than wasting some of my time), but they have numerous deals and offers and so I think users need to be aware before purchasing one."
4,"Once the team finally arrived, their work quality and professionalism were impeccable. Unfortunately, we waited weeks for the origina job to be done and no one has responded to our request for a bid on our kitchen. A shame...these are great people with major prioritization and scheduling issues."
5,Was very punctual. Moved patio furniture off of the deck for me. Only complaint is that the pressure washing unevenly blew off too much of the stain on outer deck so it was uneven when I re-stained it.
5,"The crews shifted around depending on what work was needed on a particular day, but they were all very professional, kept the noise to a minimum and cleaned up after themselves."
5,"Considering the mess that the original installer left, it went well. I was consulted about a few things as far as if I would be satisfied with the proposed ""fix."" Mark, who did the work, was very pleasant, courteous and understanding."
3,"I paid Angie's list over 3 weeks ago but then The House Doctors could only schedule a drywall repair session in December, so, of course, that's waaaay too late and I paid for nothin. I hope they will reimburse us :/"
2,"Contractor seemed much more concerned with getting payment than actually completing the work. Several of the items on the job were not done correctly and the contractor had to return to correct and or complete job. Which he did. Also the cost for materials was considerably higher than expected. The Contractor could not provide invoices for the materials specific to my job to prove out costs. He just supplied a hand written list of costs. We had used House Doctors several times prior to this, when the company was run by his father, and were always pleased with the services provided. Sadly, we had a different experience this last time, and will not be hiring them again, nor do I feel that I could recommend them."
5,"We did not have the service performed, just because they were unable to schedule a service soon enough for us. They were very professional, prompt, and helpful in my communications with them though."
3,"I purchased the $99 special on 9/8 .. Received a message on Angies list to email my phone number. Got an email someone named Bob would be contacting me. Never got a call so sent a second message on Angies list on 9/13. Got a response on Angies list to ""send Phone number"" via email. Did that again! On 9/18 got a message someone would call me. Eventually...maybe a week later a woman called to schedule appt. Said they only work 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM...and no Saturday work. WOW great hours...So for a working person that means you lose a whole day of work! Anyway..Scheduled work for 10/10-soonest appt available. On Thursday 10/9 got a voice mail that ""both guys are extremely sick and we need to reschedule appt."". Woman who left the message said since they had to cancel they would schedule me on a Saturday even though they did not usually work on Saturdays. They would come out on Saturday 10/18. I was to call back and confirm. However, the phone number the woman left was not correct! So I finally found phone number on Angies list to call back to confirm. The woman apologized for giving me the wrong number. She said they would be out on Saturday, 10/18 between 1:00PM and 3:00 PM. Sounds good.. I asked if I needed to have the materials there, she said NO..they would go get what they need. So I blocked out everything on Saturday...so they could come get this job done. At 2:30 on Saturday, I received a call from a man saying he was ""calling to schedule my job""..REALLYY!!???? I was very irritated.. I said I was scheduled for TODAY.. Oh he said..Oh no..we don't work on Saturday... Again REALLY???? I was told on two different days that they did. Still have the voice mail. He said he would speak to the woman who scheduled me for Saturday...Unbelievable. They really don't care about customer service. I am now scheduled for 10/28. However, I am very leery about the quality of work they will do if they ever show up. NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE so far... Update-Work was completed on 10/28. The area around the new skylight needed to be repaired with new drywall and then the ceiling was retextured. Also a section of the wall was patched. Mark did a great job matching the texture to the existing pattern. He also replaced a section of drywall in the garage wear I had plumbing work done. I have no complaints about the quality of work. He did need an extension ladder to perform the work, but didn't bring one. Fortunately my neighbor had one that we borrowed. Otherwise he would have had to leave to get a ladder. The job ran over an hour and I was charged $100 for the extra hour and labor. That seemed a little high for an hour of work, but I needed it finished."
1,"The man that told me to reschedule said ""what kind of job is it"" and I told him I told mike it was for drywall in the bathroom. This man said ""oh, the coupon is for very small repairs. He said you need to read the coupon. FYI...It does not say that on the coupon. They were suppose to provide 3 hours. So they told me to get a refund from Angie's List, and now Angie's List will not give me my money back. I'm not happy."
5,"Job well done, no issues, and it was completed much more quickly than I had anticipated. The workman was somewhat late (and didn't call until after he was due), but overall it went very well and I would use this company again."
3,"Everything went ok, there were a few spots that they missed though."
5,They did a wonderful job! They replaced all of the latches on our drawers. They were prompt and efficient.
5,They are outside of my service area. I was unable to use the service.
5,"They came as scheduled, discussed the options and put the drywall. The work is top notch and the staff is very professional and courteous."
3,"We were told two workers would show up but three showed up. Things started out very good in that they covered many surfaces. The work included repairing the ceiling by matching the ceiling texture. The repair did not match at all. The painter did not paint all the way to the edge which left a discoloration all around the room. We called the owner, left a message that the job was not completed to our satisfaction. The next day the same workers came out , completed the work as requested. The ceiling texture did match and the ceiling was painted all the way to the edge. We were happy with the final product. Why didn't the workers do it that way to begin with. Instead it seemed like they were only interested in getting in and out rapidly. We also contracted for new steps to be put in the garage. The worker forgot his tool that calculates the riser height. He then left to purchase the lumber. Thank goodness my husband was there to make sure the stairs were done to our satisfaction. They did turn out very nice and we were happy with the results."
4,"The porch and driveway look nice but, he left standing water on the little deck. It dried partly with a dingy finish. I have to wash it and sweep the standing water away for it to look a bit better. All in all, he did a good job."
4,"when I was finally able to get contact with the company (took over a week) we arranged a date and time. The individual arrived timely. Hewas professional and appear knowledgeable.. His adult son also accompanied him and I assisted with completing various aspects. They completed the jobs efficiently. The thing I have a problem with is his poor responsiveness. When the workmen completed the job I ask them to check something in my basement which they did and indicated that the contact person would get back to me that day or the next. It has been one week and I have not heard from the individual. Generally, their pricing is very fair but I believe on 2 sections on my bill I was over charged,replacing 3 light bulbs should not cost $25 and replacing 2 batteries in 2 smoke detectors should not cost$15. By the way the fire department will do them for free forseniors. They are close and do good work."
5,Michael Rosipko did a great job and was very professional.
5,One man arrived at my house with his gasoline power wash machine. He asked if he could connect to my outdoor water spigot. I told him to do what he needed to do and he went right to work. At about an hour and a half later he was finished. He walked the perimeter of the house with me and explained what he found during the cleaning process. I was very happy with this service.
5,They did great. He fixed the door frame that I needed and he was out. I had some other things that I wanted done but it was not covered in the Big Deal and that was okay. He didn't charge me for the materials either. What he did was great.
3,"I purchased a big deal for this service. I was kind of disappointed with that. They said they were going to plaster and I had a big hole in the ceiling. And they said they couldn't do that. So they plastered a few places, but they weren't too tidy. We had a hole in the kitchen for the light and they patched that but they didn't put the fixture that covers that hole back. I thought they should have done that. When they left I had to clean up, sweep the floor and that from the putty and little bitty things. I was really disappointed that they couldn't fix the hole by the air duct and that basically what I wanted them to do. They quoted me a price to fix the hole."
3,"I signed up for the offer but when the schedule came up to schedule service, I discovered they are only available M - F 8 - 5. Unfortunately I have to be at work during those times."
1,My husband called on 9/25/14 to inquire about replacing some doors & received their voice mail. He left a message & we still have not received a call back.
1,I never received a call back.
5,"I was on a cancellation list, and low and behold, I was called and the plaster repair tech was able to get the work done before the holidays. The 99 dollars for three hours of repair did not go very far, due to prep times and the necessity for more product from Sherwin Williams which is 1/2 hour drive from my home which was included in the length of the service call. The job itself was done well, though completion had to be accomplished over several days for dry time before final finishing."
5,I had to cancel. I was called back a few days later to reschedule. We picked another day. I then decided not to do the pressure washing at this time.
3,Never was able to set up appointment.
1,He never responded and I don't want to move forward with this deal.
1,"Two weeks later...no bid, no contact. My wife gave a long list of work. I guess they are too busy. We try to support small business, but it is frustrating when they blow you off. Two weeks lost."
5,"They were very nice when we corresponded via phone and email, but they can't do the service quickly enough. Therefore, we won't be able to use them to complete this job."
4,"They did a good job. He was done with the job in an hour and a half. The quality of service was good, it was excellent. I wasn't there. He left when there was half hour left for the 2 hours. I don't think there were any additional charges other than the 77."
3,They sent a message stating they would call and it was open ended have not heard from them.
1,"I first made contact with the house doctor to get an estimate on 7/23/2014. I must have had 30 contacts with this company via the email, and a number phone contact via voice mail. It took weeks for them to come and give me an estimate for the cost of doing the job. They would call or email me to say someone will be calling or he has your estimate all figured out, and he will call. If you have the cost figured out; then why have they not sent it via email. There is something wrong here, and I starting to wonder if they do not want to put things in writing."
4,There were no troubles with scheduling and no additional costs. They completed all of the work I had wanted to have done in a timely manner. Everything was fine.
5,"There were a couple communication issues over what exactly was to be done during the job but I suppose that happens. Overall, Jay and the House Doctors did a great job! They were willing to work with me to get the work done so I didn't have to take more time off work. They made up for communication issues by giving me a price reduction! They did a great job and cleaned up before they left! They were very nice and professional on the phone. They even did a great job of matching the original paint job on the house with the paint they used on on the new fascia boards. I would use them again!"
5,"Power washed dirt and droppings from siding, giving the town house a clean and new look! Will have this done on a regular basis. We live near Lake Erie and house attracts a lot of bugs, birds, and spiders because of location. We could not have done this, ourselves and it saved a lot of work. Price makes this an excellent value. Don't pass this up!"
5,Best job ever. Highly recommend. I have found him to be incredibly conscientious and outstanding in saying that he will do what is necessary and do it excellently. I will definitely keep him in my priority file for a job well done and above and beyond the call of duty. He kept me informed and even texted me pictures of the work done. I couldn't have asked for a better company. A+++ Dr. JLJ
1,"The individual showed up at the wrong home. He wasn't sure if he had a ladder tall enough to do the job. And he wasn't sure he had a hose long enough to go around the whole house. He asked me if he couldn't reach what would I like to skip. My house is a small raised ranch. 1350 square feet. He told me that he should get the front done in an hour and then go to the back. I told him if he had to go over a little I will pay the extra. We had paid for two hours. I didn't stay to watch him during the job. When I came back the next day, it looked like he did the trim beautifully, but the rest of the front of the house didn't look like he touched it at all. I went in the back and nothing was touched. I called to see if he was coming back. I was told he can come back but I would have to pay the standard hourly rate. He did give offer me $10.00 an hour decrease. I ended up not having them come back. If it took them two hours to do the front trim of the house, I would hate to think how long and how much I would have to spend."
2,This didn’t turn out well. They didn’t put any soap in and just used plain water. The deck didn’t get finished as they didn’t wash the railings. The person who came out looked sloppy and gave the appearance of not knowing what he was doing; he was not professional. We needed to have the work redone by a different company. When I spoke with the manager about insurance licensing he was rude.
1,"When purchasing the deal on 8/25/14 it indicated we would be called within 2 business days to at least schedule the service. On 8/26 I received an email saying Mike Vecchio would be calling. On 8/28 I emailed back saying I still had not been contacted. On 8/29 I received an email saying Mike would be reminded to call me. On 9/5 I emailed again confirming we still had not been called and that perhaps we needed to go elsewhere to have the work done. On 9/6 (10 business days later) I was finally called by Mike. He said they were very busy because of this $99 deal which is why it took so long for him to even call me. I explained we needed some repair work done to the dry wall in our basement and that we had been pushing out our carpet installation waiting for the drywall work to be scheduled. I asked for a Saturday appointment but he indicated they don't hang dry wall on Saturdays. Mike instead suggested ""THIS THURSDAY"" which would have been today, 9/11. Since it had taken so long for him to call, he was going to get us in right away. I had him on our car speaker phone and asked my husband if he could clear his schedule to be home that day. Mike confirmed he would be there between 11:30AM - 12:30PM. I gave him my husband's cell phone number and asked him to call when they were on the way. Today is 9/11/14. My husband called twice this morning trying to reach Mike to find out when they were coming. His calls were not returned. I then called Mike at 1:18pm and he answered. Mike indicated that he had us scheduled for next Thursday the 18th. I don't know how this was even possible because when I made the appointment, we never discussed the 18th. I would have never agreed to wait 12 more days from the date of our first phone call. We needed the work done Needless to say, the job is not done. I have now pushed our carpet installation out yet again. MIke did offer to have someone come out tomorrow during the day but with this late notice, neither my husband nor I can take off of work, again. My husband already lost a 1/2 days pay today waiting. I told Mike I would be home after 6pm if someone wanted to come then but he said that was too late. At this point in time, I would like my money refunded.This is our first experience and I am sad to have to report such a low rating. I am very disappointed. I understand business is booming but does that really justify poor service?"
1,I tried to call them and left a voice mail for them on 9/8/14 and 9/9/14 but the never returned my calls.
3,"The person they sent out was nice and did a good job. If I had just rated him, the scores would have been much higher. Unfortunately, the communication with that person from the company left a lot to be desired. The day they came out was actually the rescheduled date. During my original conversation, I mentioned that this would be ceiling work, so I was told that they would send out 2 people to the job (1-1/2 hours instead of 3). I thought that was a good idea. Based on their deal, which was they don't provide the supplies, I called their number in the morning (around 10AM) the day before the appointment to coordinate all of the supplies. I left a message on both of the numbers they listed. After not receiving a call back all day, I called again at about 10PM and left a message that i was cancelling the appointment, since nothing was ready for them to work with . Strangely, I got a call back within 10 minutes. After talking on the phone, they informed me that yes, they don't provide the supplies and there's an assumption that you will buy all of the supplies from them. They wanted to get to my house, survey the job, then go back to their shop to get the supplies. That sounds good, but I own a house by myself, I have a day job and I can't take the whole day off just for this appointment. I also have some experience fixing up different areas of the house, so I had a good idea of what was needed for the job. I also reminded them that this would be all ceiling work. The same answer of sending out 2 people was given. I rescheduled the appointment for about 1-1/2 weeks later. On the day of the appointment, the person arrived as scheduled. I talked with him for a bit about the job and showed him the area to be done. He asked some very good questions and we agreed on what could be done given the timeframe of the work. Only 1 person was sent and he was unaware that this was all ceiling work. The job required 5/8"" drywall to be hung on the ceiling, so I ended up having to be his 2nd guy for the 3 hour appointment and helped him lift the drywall into place and I held it for him while he installed it."
1,I called 3-4 times to have a job done on my home and no one ever picked up the phone and I was sure to call during business hours. Not a good sign.
5,"It went very well. They did a nice job and were prompt at coming out. They were efficient, neat, and reasonably priced."
5,Everything went well. The work was done as requested and completed much to our satisfaction.
5,"There were no troubles with scheduling and no additional costs beyond the price of the deal. However, they did arrive a couple hours late to the appointment. They washed the stone on the front of the house, the back porch, and a portion of the driveway. Everything turned out fine."
5,There were no troubles with scheduling and they were punctual to the appointment. There were no additional costs and the service was good.
5,"Excellent experience. The workman was friendly, professional and efficient. Did exactly what I needed done and in a short amount of time."
2,"I very much liked the person who came out. Courteous, professional etc. He said he would call me (gave a time estimate). But he never called back!!! No work was performed."
1,The service was horrible! The provider does not use any solution to clean and so there is really nothing he is doing other than wasting your water. I actually asked him to stop washing the sidings mid way since I didn't want him to waste more of his time and my water. I asked the gentleman who was cleaning if he can come back with the proper cleaning solutions but he said that his employer does not like using more resources to buy cleaning solutions since it is not his main line of business. Why would one advertise for a service that they don't really specialize in and don't really care about. That is wrong and unethical! Stop lying to customers and stop stealing from us! I tried calling the owner to discuss the issue and either refund my money or redo the job but he refused to return my calls! I think this company is running a scam and people ought to be careful! I don't know where they get good reviews from if this is the kind of work they perform. At least return the customers call and come up with a plan on how to fix the problem not abandon the work and disappear! Stop using Angie's list as a way of getting quick cash from desperate customers!
5,"It went well! Initially, they wanted to use the same holes that were already in the cabinets. However, I eventually convinced them to create new holes and the doors close much better now."
5,Very well done... I would use them again.
3,"I will NOT be using them and would like my $99.00 back from Angie's List. Found another contractor not on A L. On time, made suggestions, had references and pictures of projects completed. Quote was higher but got our quote the NEXT day, not a week later."
3,We had the three hours of work completed as well as two additonal hours of work at the standard rate. The drywall has been applied through our entire basement and we asked to schedule a follow up to have the walls sanded. We were told we would be contacted in a few days to schedule the completion of the work. Its been three weeks and we have left three messages with no return call. Quality work doesnt matter if you cant get anyone to complete it
4,I feel like the charge was too much for the amount of work that was completed.
5,THE HOUSE DOCTORS DID A GREAT JOB AND WERE PROFESSIONAL AND PUNCTUAL BOTH IN RETURNING MY CALLS AND PROVIDING SERVICE.
1,"Called for a quote. Chris came out on Friday 8/8 took information, and said we would be contacted by Monday or Tuesday with a quote. I received no call with the quote information. On Wednesday I called and left a voice mail that I was wondering if a quote was available. As of today I have not received any response. Certainly does not want me to use them. Very odd and not very professional."
3,"I bought the drywall service to have a repair made in the apartment I was living in. The provider contacted me within two days like he was supposed to and asked for my phone number which I provided, but we never spoke. I had to have the repair made prior to my lease expiring and made that clear when the service was purchased. I had to hire someone else to do the repair because I had to turn in the keys for the apartment. I would appreciate it if you would refund me the $99 purchase price."
5,"Mark quickly set out to complete the drywall work as contracted through a special offered through Angie's List. He set to work on time, was professional, pleasant and neat about his work. A kitchen cabinet next to the drywall repair in the kitchen was in dire need of repair. To my relief, Mark accepted my request for this additional work. The task was challenging as the cabinet drooped, the doors needed to be adjusted, and the crown molding needed to be recut and rehung. Mark returned within 2 weeks to finish the drywall and cabinet repair with trim work--overtime on a Saturday morning. We are very satisfied with Mark's work, and we would hire him in the future."
1,"This provider, The House Doctors, makes better cancellations than it does appointments. For more than 2 weeks I've been trying to make an appointment, but either they do not call me back OR the number is the wrong number OR they have to cancel due to an emergency (twice). I'm officially done with this House Doctor. I was never even able to get an estimate for painting and drywall work on my home. Time to try the next provider on the list. I definitely DO NOT recommend this, (and I have a hard time even using this term), provider."
5,"I did have to phone the company myself since it hadn't contacted me after purchasing the deal, but everything turned out very well for the most part. The gentleman was very communicative about any delays or time issues, he and his assistant were courteous and professional, and they did a quality job in all respects. It was actually quite nice that the gentleman had an assistant because this allowed him to complete more work in the allotted timeframe. Furthermore, they cleaned up after themselves and kept the mess to a minimum which I appreciated."
5,the job is a nicely finished job.
1,Terribly. I bought the big deal and they never called even after you folks contacted them on my behalf. This is unfortunate because they appear to be a very good firm and I was looking forward to working with them.
5,"The provider honored the contract, even coming back on two different dates to complete the job. The dry wall had to ""dry"" and the area on which the work was done had to be touched up with matching wall paint. Getting the right color paint took me a couple of trips to Home Depot before I finally contacted the provider to let him know I was ready for the touch up. The job looks very good."
5,"The provider was prompt in contacting me. However, the company was not able to come out and do the work until later the following week. I was able to find another provider to do the work sooner."
3,"We purchased an Angie's List deal with the House Doctors that was $99 for 3 hours worth of plaster repair, which ended up being two workers for an hour and a half. We were contacted in a timely manner, etc. and the work that was done was of good quality. But I was asked to provide drywall of all things and garbage bags and I was still was charged $20 for supplies! I am not sure why they showed up to a plaster repair job without dry wall. I did agree to the extra $65 because everything I wanted done took a little longer but I still feel like I didn't get the 'deal' I signed up for."
2,"Based on Angie's list's recommendations, I called and left a message over the weekend of July 18th. I didn't get a call back, so I called again a few days later. Bob called me on July 22nd and we had a very pleasant conversation in which I described all the work I needed done. He expressed gratitude for calling his company, and I expressed gratitude that he called back. He said his son Michael would be calling me to set up a time to come out for an estimate. That was on 7/22. On 7/28, I followed up and left another message since I did not get a call from Michael or anyone else. It is now 8/1 and I haven't heard a peep. While I do understand this is a very busy time for remodeling/repair/construction, I just find it very unprofessional that I was told I would receive a call but then never actually got it. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and followed up with them, hoping they would redeem themselves, but they didn't. I suppose if you are in the market for repair work, it's best to call during the winter."
5,The most recent time we called them was to get an estimate on replacing a storm door. We chose not to have them do that particular job. However we have used them in the past and plan to use them again in the future.
4,"It took them a really long time to schedule a date. There was contact right after buying the deal and then nothing for months. Then out of nowhere, they contacted me to set a date. This was my only issue with them. They arrived on time, all fees were explained and they did a very professional job. They also cleaned up well before leaving. I would definitely recommend them if you have drywall work and the ability to wait."
2,"I already wrote an extensive review regarding the difficulty of contacting the service provider, but the review wasn't posted. I understand why the difficulty occurred but I'm not going to write another review that probably won't be posted."
2,"It didn’t go too well. I was unable to get ahold of him before I purchased the Deal. We wanted him to replace the wood ladder that goes up to the attic with an aluminum ladder. When he finally came, he told us that he couldn’t perform the service we wanted, so he patched two small holes in the wall. That went well. It took him about an hour and then he left."
5,MARK did a fantastic job. Got so much accomplished in 2 hours! Would highly recommend
2,Nowhere on the coupon did it say they don't give estimates. I can't imagine someone coming to do a job without knowing what they are going to do or what to bring in advance. More than likely the job would not be completed in 3 hrs which mean I will have this eye sore in my living room ceiling until they can arrange to come back and finish.
3,The soonest they can come out is August 8th.
5,"It went well. It looks so much better. They offered to come back to paint the ceiling but I had other work pending. They were friendly. They cleaned up after themselves. They were helpful, they explained what they were doing."
5,"It took a while to get an appointment because of the $99 deal on Angie's List...I guess they were pretty busy. Once I got the appointment though, everything went well. Mark was very professional, listened to me, gave me options, and left the room completely clean even after three hours of drywall repair. He pretty much performed a miracle! He has to come back to complete the job as it was a big job and took more than 3 hours. He did great work and I'm looking forward to having it done!"
5,"It was fine. The electricians were professional, fast, and very congenial. All the repairs were done quickly and done well."
4,Mike did a very good job and completed all the tasks I had for him in a very professional manner. Very pleasant to work with also. I was not sure if I would use this company again because I had such a hard time getting an appointment set up because Mr. Vecchio said that they were very busy. It took about 2 months from the initial contact to finally getting the work done. I would hope in case of an emergency they would come faster. I would probably use them again if I could get Mr. Rasipko to do the work.
5,"The service was quick, fast and easy. Everything is working very well. Thanks!"
1,"I first contacted them for an estimate June21st they cancelled and said they would reschedule but never got back to me, so I saw a Big deal and thought maybe try again, but got no response, I called left message twice and no return calls, this is no way to run a business, I've used them before and had no problem, but I am done with their service."
5,The doors look great and Mike did exactly what I was looking for.
2,"They sent out 1 person and he came out on time, but we were expecting at least a 2 man crew. When I first spoke to Mr. Vecchio, I told him to come out and give me an estimate first, but he said they would be ready to start the work when they got there. The worker who came out showed up empty-handed, without any supplies. My wife had to take off work and was very displeased about that she missed work without them getting the project taken care of, so we have canceled the deal."
5,"The contractor arrived on time, explained how he would do the job, and then completed the work. The plastering work in the family room matched the design of the rest of the ceiling beautifully. I would use this company again."
3,I purchased the deal and emailed House Doctors with several dates in Feb. Did not hear back and ended up using someone else. In April or May I received a phone from Mark Thompson who works for House Doctors. He apologized for the late contact but House Doctors had been booked up. (Probably due to Angie's Big Deal). He was very nice and I probably would use them in the future on a more flexible project.
1,I have used them before and was very pleased with them. They returned my call in a matter of minutes and were here within two {2} hours. This time I called Monday 6/23/14 and got a recording saying the would get back to me soon. I didn't get a return call on Monday 6/23 or Tuesday 6/24. I called them again on Wednesday 6/25 and got the voicemail again. I left my name an phone number. It is now Saturday and still haven't heard from them. I will call someone else on Monday. I will not recommend them to any one. The least they should done is call and told me they unable to do the job!
5,I've used House Doctors in the past and will use them in the future should I need any handy man services. They are responsive and reliable.
5,"The guy who worked on the house did an excellent job. It was not small accomplishment to get off the numerous coats of paint over the years and get the windows to look so excellent. He was polite, kind, conscientious and thorough. We walked through the project at the beginning and near the end. He cleaned up after himself and cleaned up more area than he had to. It was an exceptional job."
3,The service was good. It went as planned but I was a little disappointed as I felt it was incomplete. I felt they were using the Big Deal to try and get me to purchase more services. I ended up completing the job myself. The guys were nice to work with but it was not a complete job.
4,Not like I expected. Miscommunication. Not enough knowledge about lathe and plaster to make proper repairs
5,Pleasant worker and eager to please.
5,"They responded to me in a timely manner. They put one piece of siding on my garage, installed paneling in my basement and installed a pole in my closet to hang clothing on. They also boarded up my garage window that was missing. I paid extra to purchase plaster and paneling for the work, we went to Home Depot together to pick out the materials. The service worked well. I like them because they are able to do lots of different things which makes life easier."
1,"Purchased an Angie's Big Deal on April 19, 2014 and received confirmation email Mr. Bob Vecchio (bobhousedoc@aol.com)and replied with my name and telephone number. I had a voice mail message the next week, which I returned. I had a second voice mail message the next week, which I returned. Not having received another call, I called The House Doctors and left a voice mail with my name, phone number and my I was calling. I never heard back from anyone at The House Doctors."
1,"It was fine until my appointment day. He said he would be arriving between 8-12 today. At 2:30 he has still no shown up, I called and left him a voice mail. He called back and hour later saying I was second on the list, but I fired him. I could have been out getting things done instead of waiting all day on him to show up when he was supposed to."
4,"It turned out okay. There was a delay in getting them to come out on the side of the service provider. When they did come out, it was just one tech. I was not at home at the time."
4,"He was a very hard worker, and reduced my bill due to a mis-communication regarding his start time. In a confirmation call from his boss, he stated that a worker would be there between 9-9:30am. The worker showed up around 11:15. He stated that he never starts that early and apologized for the mix-up. I did contact Angie's List initially when I was trying to set up the appointment. I was having difficulty getting my calls returned."
5,It went well. The worker was on time and was polite and professional. He did a good job. The scheduling was acceptable and they were out within about 3-4 weeks. The cleanup was good.
5,"This was an Angie's List Big Deal. He had to reschedule twice, but once he got here, he did a nice job. He let me know up front how much he thought he could get done within the 3 hours included with the Deal and the rate for additional work. We agreed on the order he would do things and he got to work. The patio looks MUCH better and the siding too. He was careful to move a set of wind chimes I had missed so they didn't get damaged by the spray."
5,Scheduling was good. The fence looked nice when they were finished.
3,I’ve used them for other projects and the work was OK but again the pricing was way too high.
5,"After purchasing the deal, they were busy and we had to wait for open availability. As soon as they had an opening, they were able to come out right away. They completed the work and cleaned up well. They were no additional fees beyond the cost of the deal. My experience with them turned out very good."
5,They were very good. I am trying to get him to do other work for me. They were polite and professional. They had good ideas on things I was looking at. They cleaned up well after themselves.
1,"Gave supplier 3 dates as requested on original order. Supplier a left voice mail to call. I called multiple times but always got an answering machine. Supplier called back twice but never set a date as I requested multiple times. They don't listen to their messages as I told them to stop playing phone tag and give me a date. Very unsophisticated group without an office phone or email. They ignored the 3 dates I gave them and never offered another. Placed order on 5-31, gave up trying on 6-10."
2,I never received a call back to schedule the appointment.
4,"On time, professional, did a good job"
5,"Came immediately to try to find a rat in my house - was to return the next day, but could not due to family issues. Did return and stop up all possible entries for rodent. Clean work. Unfortunately did not find rodent!"
2,"Nobody called. I sent another email WEEKS later and still no reply. Finally I received a call from someone, but I was out of town. I returned the call and there was only voice mail. We played phone tag for a couple of days and then I received a voice mail message that I was being put on their schedule for sometime mid-July (I don't have my calendar with me at the moment) . Of course I will accept this date… it looks like I have no choice. I am worried about the quality of the work that I may get, seeing how poor their customer service is. The Deal was purchased on April 8th. So in essence, it's going to be 3 months before I get the work done. That, I believe, is a record for any deal that I have purchased through Angie's List. Too Long!!"
1,"I reached out a few times to get some more information, and I never heard back from them. I would not recommend this company."
5,"Everything went well, and we were very happy with the service. Scheduling the work was easy, the two-man crew arrived on time, and it did a great job without leaving behind any messes."
5,"We were very pleased with the work. They were very professional and worked very well. Rick was very good about explaining things as they went along. If they were going to be late and they were on two occasions they did try to call and let us know. All the work is beautiful, you can't even tell where repairs were made. Great job."
1,"I had water damage in basement during the cold. Plumbers came out to fix the problem and these guys came to rebuild basement. They insisted on half money up front. They got a permit and things that they were supposed to do. The quote was rather high, but I wanted it done right. I gave them a little more than half when I received my insurance check. My neighbors noticed they were not putting in the moisture barriers in the walls. The inspector also came out and noticed some plumbing issues and called that the work be stopped until the plumbing was fixed properly. The plumbers corrected the problem, but since then, House Doctors have not come back out to complete their portion of the job. I just want my basement done. I also noticed that a shovel was missing and my basement dryer was not working. It turned out they never turned the gas back on. They still have a huge mess and all of their materials in my basement. I have paid them all of this money, but the work is not done. They are ignoring my calls, not picking up their stuff, giving me any of my money back, or completing the work."
5,The job went extremely well. They called promptly after I signed up for my Big Deal. They called to confirm and arrived during the window they said the would. They checked in with me through every step as the job clearly was going to take more and resources than what I paid for in the Deal. They completed the job to my satisfaction and they cleaned up after themselves. I would definitely use them in the future.
5,They do very good work. I wish they would've called before they showed up. The painting job looks great.
5,He was polite and did his work. He completed all areas that were requested. Great Job!
5,"Looked at what needed to be done and told us what they were going to do, which they did. Finished work in timely fashion."
2,"I left a message. He got back to me, and told me he was looking at after June 19. I called him back and left a message with possible dates and he never called me back. I got someone else to do the work."
4,Job went ok. Provider did what I paid for and showed me how to finish the job myself.
3,"I've been calling this contractor off and on for over a month and have never received a return phone call. The number listed goes to a voice mail that only states the telephone number. With such a high rating here on Angie's List, I was expecting more. I'm still hoping to hear from them."
5,Scheduled and showed up right on time. Work performed fine. My concrete and brick are pretty old so I didn't have high expectations. They did the best they could do with what they had to work with. The House Doctors did everything as promised. I'd use them in the future for other projects.
5,He was very professional and personable. We did not have to wait long for an appointment and he showed up on time. He cleaned up after himself and even offered advice on other work items we need done.
5,Very friendly guys and quick service. Helpful and informative. It worked just as it usually does with The House Doctors. I continue to use them because I have such a great experience with them every time.
5,"I purchased a $99 big deal on Feb. 12th, 2014 and a few days later received an email asking for my phone number so they could contact me which I sent. however after several weeks they still had not called to schedule so I called twice and left messages before receiving a reply. by then they were booked out for several weeks so the soonest they could come out was beginning of May. Mark arrived on time and was very polite. they did a good job of cleaning up after themselves, and covering everything during the process to minimize dust. I did need to pay an additional $170.00 to get the job done ""right"" (second coating of dry wall plaster requiring 2 additional hours of labor plus $40 supplies). I was a little taken aback by the additional cost but do feel they did I good job. However at $65 per hour of labor for 2 guys I will definitely do the repainting myself."
1,He never bothered to call back.
3,"Overall, it went ok. They said they couldn’t do two stories, which I wish I would have known. I also had to pay for some additional time to get the job finished, and it seemed like they charged me for an hour to cover a half hour’s work. If I could do it over, I would not purchase this Deal again."
1,"When I tried to get an appointment set up, they told me it would be way far out. The man I spoke with was rude and did not have common people skills and didn't know how to talk with people. He told me to just get a refund."
4,Work was done less than 3 hrs but had to pay additional cost for parts.
1,"I’ve tried contacting them repeatedly, but I haven’t gotten any response."
4,"Generally the work was OK. The problem is that there was a push to agree to more work and, the the time, we didn't want it done. Within days I contacted them again to do follow-up work and do the next phase of what was started, and I never heard back from them."
1,When I call for my appointment they service provide told me he could not do the work until May 6 which was over 4 weeks away. I really wanted the work done so excepted the day because my Big Deal was going to run out but it was not a very convent day to get it done. I took off work and wait for him to show up. They did not even call me to tell me they were running behind. I had to call twice to find that out. Then they strung me along all afternoon telling me they me there in an hour. Finally at 4 pm they called and ask if they could come tomorrow. No you cannot come tomorrow I have work. If they had call me that morning and told me that they could not make it. I could have gone to work but because they did not call and then they strung me along all afternoon I wasted the whole day. I do not think they did not have any plan to do the work that day. I think they forgot about my job completely. Also I think part of the problem is I have the Big Deal and they did not want to honor it.
1,"It did not go. They did not answer me, contact me or anything. Angie's List or they got the $99 for nothing."
5,"Jim called to say he'd be 1/2 hour late but arrived on time and paid close attention when I showed him the work I needed done which included 2 ceiling cracks and several holes in the walls caused by appliance installations, etc. He went right to work and explained that one of the cracks would require a longer time to complete because the ceiling needed to be cut out and replaced with drywall. He had thoroughly inspected the damage and determined that the previous attempt at repair was shoddy and the ceiling had not been attached to the ceiling properly. The other crack in the ceiling did not require replacement and he was able to lightly plaster the crack which would then be painted over so that the crack didn't show. The previous owner of the house had not used the ceiling fan in the shower resulting in a sagging ceiling. Jim worked on the ceiling in the bathroom and got it fixed the patched the various holes then went for matching paint (which I paid him back for ) and when he returned the ceiling was dry. He then painted the ceiling in the bathroom and the results were wonderful. Beyond the original deal of $99 for 3 hours work, I paid an additional $180 (3 hours extra at $60 per hour plus $48 in supplies). For a total cost of $279 plus supplies, I was very pleased with the job and will set up another time to have the hallway ceiling cut out and repaired. I felt the price was right for the amount of time that was taken and Jim's attention to detail was great. He even climbed a ladder into my attic to make sure that the shower fan was vented out of the attic, not just blowing moist air into the attic. The end result was beautiful, more than I could have hoped for."
5,"Took advantage of an Angie's List Big Deal and glad I did. ""Jim"" was the man who did the work and he was very professional, even fixing a couple of things I should have mentioned and didn't. If Jim represents the type of person and quality of work to expect from House Doctors, we will be using them again. Very pleased with everything he did."
5,"The guy who did the work showed up about 30 minutes late but did call to let me know. The owner showed up close the end of the job. I paid an intro discount for 3 hours of drywall work. The work was done very well, however what I thought was a pretty small job (patching an area approx 24""-24"" and skim coating) took 4 1/2 hours so I had to pay an extra $70+. When he initially looked at it he told me he could get it done in 3 hours. I also had to do the finish sanding myself (they offered to return to do it but I didn't want to pay any more). Overall the quality is very good. I can't tell there was ever an issue with the ceiling. Although it took longer and cost more than expected, it was still far less than another quote that I got. I am very glad I hired someone who knows how to do the job right instead of trying to do it myself. He also gave me some quotes for skim coating and painting in other parts of my home and feel the price is too high for the work that needs to be done, although I am sure the work would be good."
5,"The House Doctors, as always, did an excellent job doing various work around the outside of the house. I always have full confidence in their work and they never let me down."
5,It was an Angie's List Big Deal that I purchased. It went really well. They worked well with my schedule. They gave me a couple of openings and one worked really well for me. I basically said there were two days that I could be home and they made it happen. They showed up on time. The guy they sent knew how to do the work. He knew the best way to do it and knew how to do it up to code. They cleaned up. I paid an additional $270 over the deal.
5,"Couldn't be happier with the dry wall repair job that Mark did for us on a $99 Deal. I paid for it in Feb. and asked if they could hold off till warmer weather for the work, because that's when the pops are worse. Mark came on 4/23 as requested, and this is a challenging area to work on in our house. It's been repaired twice before, but Mark tackled it really well, and it looks ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!! It may not last forever, but he did a fine job and is a great representative for his company -- polite, friendly and very talented. You wouldn't be able to tell that any work was done on the ceiling, 'cause it looks so good! This problem was part of a really large project done for us by Jeff Desatnik in January of 2013. Unfortunately, the 2 bad nail pops reappeared in the summer, along with the loose tape in the ceiling joint. I left several messages for Jeff in Aug. and Sept. and actually talked to him a couple of times, too, but he never showed up here. I know he's busy with big jobs (like our original one), but we hoped he would find the time to fix the problems we encountered in the areas he repaired in January. We liked Jeff a lot but are VERY disappointed in his lack of follow through for us."
1,"Purchased ""$99 for up to 3 Hours of Drywall/Plaster Repair"" on 09/03/2013. It has been 7 months and I am still waiting for Bob to be healthy enough to do the work. Angies List is supposed to filter out providers like this. Very poor communication and customer service."
5,"The garbage disposal in my kitchen literally fell off of the bottom of the sink when I turned it on. The clamping mechanism had become loose, and the unit fell down when the vibration of me turning it on made it come totally loose. The House Doctors were called at 3:30 pm, and the plumber arrived 3 hours later as promised, at 6:30 pm. He remounted the garbage disposal unit, and also replaced several of the chrome plated pipes under the sink, because they were corroded and ready to start leaking. The plumber cleaned up after under the sink when the work was done, and the left the kitchen spic and span."
5,"That went well. The deal was for three hours of work but they were here a lot longer and they charged me a lot more. It was expensive. They had to leave it to dry and then come back for more. They did a good job but it was a big job for three hours. The clean up was fine. It just seemed like it took them a long time, which is what I remember but maybe it was required, I don’t know. There was a lot more money and a lot more time involved but we liked them. It all worked well and it looks really good, you can never make out there was ever a hole there."
5,"They promptly responded to my call and set up an appointment to come out and do the work within a few days. They came as promised, installed the hose carrier, no muss, no fuss."
5,"bought a big deal, for 2 hours of handyman service. after a couple emails back and forth the work was scheduled promptly the handy man showed up exactly on time. the work did extend past the 2 hour slot, but he gave me the option to stop if I wanted to. works great! well worth the money to get that finished as I couldn't do it myself."
1,"I bought the deal on Thursday 4/10, indicating I wanted the service any time from Tuesday 4/15 thru Thursday 4/17. I got in contact with The House Doctors/Bob Vechio Saturday, 4/12 giving my phone number. Bob Vechhio never called me though I left two voice mails for him on two separate days during the time period I had wanted the service."
5,"This was a hard project because it involved plumbing and dry wall. After Marc got the dry wall up and painted, a water bubble was noted in the ceiling. All the work work Marc had done had to be removed. It was then discovered that the wax ring under the toilet needed to be replaced. The House Doctors sent Bob the plumber out to fix that problem. Marc came back, redid the dry and painted the ceiling and it looks just beautiful,"
5,"The repairman came about two weeks after I paid his starting fee. He was a nice guy that knew what he was doing. The job took a little longer than I thought it would to complete. Overall, he was a nice worker that did a good job."
5,"They are very busy, so there was somewhat of a wait for a time for them to come out. Other than that, no complaints or issues."
4,"I am updating my review below after the provider provided a response. I understand that the owner was going through dental surgery at the time I contacted him. I do wish someone called me after the fact to explain why no one reached out to me, but understand that things happen. Lousy service. I don't understand how providers in the business of providing ""service"" don't actually provide any. I emailed the provider and Bob Vecchio emailed me back on 4/6 to ask for my address, which I provided right away. I didn't hear anything so I followed up with him on 4/11. Bob e-mailed back and asked for my phone number which I once again provided right away. After that, nothing. No call, no e-mail. Even if he was the best man for the job I would not hire him at this point. I appreciate timeliness, responsiveness and basic professional courtesy - Bob and The House Doctors have none of these. Just a big waste of my time."
3,"They came out and really only did about two hours of work. They hung up some mirrors. I needed them to fix some aluminum siding, and the gentleman never even brought out a ladder. He promised to come back to finish the job, then the company never followed up with me. The work that was done was done well, but they did not do the amount of work I was expecting when I purchased the deals."
4,One guy came and completed the job over a course of a couple of days. We did have to do some rescheduling but everything worked out fine. They did a good job with the work.
1,"I purchased a $99 3 hour drywall coupon which was stupid on my part. You cant do much in 3 hours. They basically slathered mud on everything leaving me with a huge project to do. Months later all the mud has cracked and needs to be redone again anyways. The guy talked to me for about 1/2 of the 3 hours. Total waste of money. I really wish I had thought it through as all it did was cause me to miss work, lose $100, and have to tend to hours of sanding and remudding."
5,"When the scheduled workman called off because of a sick child, they found someone to come over since I had the day off. I watched the guy fix the stuck window that had been stuck open 10 years. He was pleasant and explained both what he was doing and what my have happened to get it stuck. It was once again a great experience. These guys are the best and have the best prices. They are my go-to-guys."
1,Did not return my call for two weeks
5,"Great job, polite and did all that was askied."
5,"Fantastic! Mike began by clearly outlining what improvements should be made and was very familiar with the housing codes of the City of Mayfield Heights. The depth and scope of services was significant.They capitalized on the few good weather days during March to complete masonry repairs on the exterior of the house, installed a custom glass block window to seal a cold storage cellar, and delicately removed an old t.v. antenna from a chimney. They completely transformed the interior of the home by painting trim, cabinets, doors and the like with a lovely oil based enamel. Kitchen cabinets also were updated with new hinges and handles that looked great. Plumbing repairs included caulking, installing a new faucet and filling in grout which was done with precision. In order to solve the problem of an unsightly open space in the rec room, Mike custom designed, built and stained a beautiful bookcase. Insulation was also installed to minimize heat loss. The crew worked hard, were on time and kept everything clean. Mike kept me informed on the progress of the job and finished within the original estimated time frame. I highly recommend them!"
5,My experience was fine. The results are good. Scheduling was great and they were able to do the work when I was not there.
4,My experience was okay. There was one person here doing the work and it took the full three hours. We had to finish the project since he was only here for 3 hours. Scheduling was fine and they were prompt for the appointment.
5,"I sent Bob an email and he as always responded right away. Being a female homeowner and always being fearful of being taken advantage of it is always a comfort to deal with someone who respects you. To hear Bob say ""Don't worry we will take care of you"" was such a comfort. Bob has a way of making you feel like you are calling on a friend instead of just hiring someone. This is the 3rd time I have had plumbing work done by The House Doctor and as usual it was done quickly and efficiently. Robert called me the day before made an appointment time and showed up at that time! He was friendly and professional. When he was done he left the area clean and free of any debris. Thank you for your service."
5,"Smoothly, they were easy to work with and professional!"
5,"The crew showed up on time, with all the proper tools, and aluminum material to be custom fitted to the garage door, people-door, and roof fascia. The fit, finish and color of all pieces matched the original pieces exactly. Very professional crew, they were polite and efficient."
3,"They did what we needed them to do, but I would say that it was top quality. Unfortunately they did not protect the sink which is one of those plastic marble type things. So, we got scratches by stuff they dropped in the sink. The plaster was a little bit bumpy. So, they are not a company I would have back. I know that they did not remove all the wall paper. I had to do that and paint the parts that they have not done. I am even looking at the plaster now and it is even pot-marked. The price was fine."
4,They did a nice job. Scheduling was not an issue.
4,They contacted me after a few days of me purchasing the deal. I needed it done within a few weeks because we were selling the house. He said he wouldn’t be able to come for at least seven weeks which was too long for me to wait.
5,"Good customer service, technician arrived on time and did good work."
3,"The washing of the house was completed and he used the remaining time to wash only 10% of the deck. The scheduling was an issue because I had to wait for over 30 days. So, I would recommend if you need the job done within 2 weeks."
3,"The crown molding looks really good. He made a huge mess though because he cut the wood in my house in the room he was working in instead of my covered back deck. He did a partial clean up using a small light pick up vaccum cleaner I had in the room which was not made for that kind of fine cleanup and when we picked it up it fell out all over the place. If we had know he was going to do the sawing in the room we would have covered the couch because it was covered in fine particles from the sawing he did in the room. Fortunately we were able to, and did, move the rug out of the room. But our PC was in there and who knows what got in it. Even though we had spoken a couple of times over the phone with someone about the dining room table, he said he was not told about it and did not come prepared to do it so the pieces of wood he used to repair it were way bigger than necessary and I am now concerned someone will bump their knee on it. The slider needed to be repaired and he didn't even address that directly. He just did, basically, a patch job so the table doesn't fall when we have to open it. The table is Ethan Allen so it is not a cheap piece of furniture to do a ""whatever"" kind of repair job on it. I might use them again but I would be selective about the type of thing I have them do because of the ""job"" they did on my dining room table."
1,"I bought the Big Deal for $99 for drywall repair. My first 3-4 phone calls to the contractor weren't returned. Then I contacted Angie's List for help. They told me that I had to use their new communication portal to contact the contractor. I tried that too but no luck. I finally got in touch with the contractor who said someone would call me back soon. I never heard back. I called a few more times. Finally, more than a month after my initial phone call, the contractor called me back and we played phone tag for a couple days, until he just stopped calling me back. I'll never use or recommend them for work at my house or my rental properties. As for Angie'ls List, I wasn't very happy with the service from the Big Deal group. When I contacted them a second time to request a refund, they asked me if I would be willing to use another contractor if they would be willing to honor the original Big Deal. I agreed and so they said they would contact me in 1-2 days to let me know. They never contacted me so a week later I asked for a refund which I did receive. I've purchased several Big Deals over the past few years and have never had a problem like this. I'm not sure I will purchase them ever again after this terribly frustrating experience."
5,They did an excellent job on 5 ceilings 3 of which had water damage. It was all completed within a day and a half and not a drop of paint landed anywhere it shouldn't have been. Thank you!
5,They responded quickly and booked the work in a timely manner. Mark performed the work and was very professional. He cleaned up after himself and the work itself appears to be of high quality. I am very pleased and will use the company again.
5,It went great. They were very pleasant people. They were on time and did good work.
1,"I purchased the Big Deal ($99 for 3 hrs drywall repair) on March 1 and a few hours later received an email from them saying they'd be in touch soon to schedule. I waited a week, and then replied to the email to remind them that I still hadn't been contacted. I did get an email reply saying that they would be in touch soon. It's now March 20 and I still haven't been contacted to schedule. Have requested a refund of the deal from Angie's list and have contacted other providers (who have been much more responsive). Can only guess that House Doctors can't manage the volume due to the deal, but the fact that they didn't even call to tell me that or get me on the schedule is unacceptable. Don't waste your time on this deal."
1,"I purchased an Angie's List drywall special from the House Doctors but they never called to schedule the work. I sent contact information and heard nothing so I sent another note only to receive a message back saying the information was received. I've called and left two voice mails and still not been contacted. More than one month later, I've still not been contacted to set up work. Needless to say, I wouldn't want them to do the work now anyway."
1,"Bought drywall coupon 2/7/14, Cannot get in touch wth anyone. Calls and e-mail not returned. Waste of time and money."
1,"The service provider is very hard to get hold of. After several calls without responses, I am tired of waiting."
1,They are very difficult to get a hold of. It is not consumer friendly due to nobody being on the phone. They do not call back in a timely manner. This is very inconvenient.
3,"The provider contacted us quickly, but was unable to schedule the work for nearly two months."
5,"He finished the patch in well under the allotted three hours (including a run to the Home Depot for supplies), so he found a few other cracks on the walls and patched those as well. It took several weeks to schedule the repair, but given the discount, I didn't mind that very much."
1,i WAS UNABLE TO CONTACT HIM. SOMEONE NAMED CARL CALLED ONCE AND DIDN'T LEAVE A MESSAGE. I CALLED BACK IN 5 MINUTES AND THERE WAS NO ANSER. i LEFT SEVERAL MESSAGE. IF HE DIDN' WANT TO HONOR THE COUPON HE SHOULD NOT BE USING THEM.. I WANT A REFUND AND WILL CALL
5,"Scheduling was a little tricky, but once I had an appt, Jim arrived on time and got to work. He worked efficiently and quickly and did a good job. The finishing (counter sinking/puddying the nail holes) could have been better, but overall, I am satisfied with the work."
5,"The House Doctor plumber arrived very quickly to fix the broken handle on my bathroom sink. The broken handle needed to be taken apart, analyzed, and repaired with new parts. The plumber quickly got the correct parts for the repair, he came back very quickly, he repaired the handle, he cleaned up the area and was gone within just a few minutes. All and all this was a very good service experience."
5,My 1/2 bathroom walls were left covered with wallpaper glue and uneven from a previous contractor. House doctors was able to fix everything and then repaint. The walls look new
5,As described above the job went well as the worker was very skilled and professional.
5,The job went very well. The worker arrived at the time promised and did a very through job. When troubleshooting he discovered the job was going to be larger than expected. He informed us of what he discovered and kept us informed at each step of the process. When unexpected problems developed he offered options and came up with solutions that worked. We are very pleased by the professionalism of Michael Rosipko and hope to work with him in the future.
5,"On the coldest (and probably busiest for plumbers) day of the year, I had a hot water pipe burst, spewing water through my kitchen ceiling. While I was able to turn the hot water off, due to the harsh conditions, I expected it to take several days to get repaired, and had no idea how much it would cost. I tried several plumbers, but the House Doctors were the only one to return my call that day. They came out that evening, around my schedule, and had me fixed up in no time. Very professional, answered all my questions while working to solve my problem, and under the conditions, extremely reasonable on price. Highly recommend!"
5,They did a fine job and would hire them again.
1,"It was the worst purchase I ever made and my experience was bad. He called me to book the appointment and he had to schedule a month out. I had a mold problem on my back deck I needed addressed immediately so I had to hire another company to take care of it. 10 days later, a kid shows up to pressure wash the driveway when I thought it was going to take a month for The House Doctors to come out. I was not expecting him to show up and no one gave me a call. He did an adequate job. I wish I could have gotten both jobs done, I would have gotten a better value out of deal."
3,They came out to complete the work I asked them to please call me if it was going to go over the 2 hours. I did not hear from them. They ended up trying to bill me for extra time. I did not pay it and I hired someone else to come out and complete the work.
5,Everything went fine and I was very happy he was able to take care of all my needs in those 2 hours. Scheduling was very easy. He was very pleasant in my home and did everything I had asked him to do.
5,Everything turned out just fine and it was all straight forward. One technician was here doing the work and it only took about 2 hours to complete. Scheduling went well and they called me set up an appointment. The results look great.
5,The House Doctor sent Jim who performed all tasks in a professional manner for a good price. Jim was prompt and responsive to all requests. Job well done! Thanks House Doctor. Roger K.
5,"They came out, and it was all done within a couple of days. They came out right on time, and I liked working with them. Mike was very friendly, very talkative at times, he did quality work, he knew exactly what he was doing, and if you asked him a question, because you didn't understand, he would take the time to explain everything to you, and tell you why he was doing it."
2,starting over from scratch and removing the work that was done. I have no choice but to do that. I expected more and am very disappointed with their effort.
5,"The job went fine. There was a small area in our bedroom ceiling where the textured drywall compound has pulled away from the drywall. It took a couple of calls to get a call-back. The fellow that came out was courteous, was careful about cleanliness and did a nice job patching and texturing the effected area. This was part of an Angie's List Big Deal ($99 for three hours of work). The only odd part was that after the job I was asked for $20 to cover materials. The only material was the compound used for skim coating an area about 3 'x 4'. I paid it, considering it a tip for a job well done."
5,It worked out well. They contacted me and then they came out as soon as I could schedule a time so they were prompt. They did a fine job and they worked with me to do exactly what I asked to have done. They were easy to work with and they were responsive to the requests I had.
1,"They showed up quickly, took my money, and never did the service. I had to pressure them to send my money back."
5,"They did fine. It was a sort of a Spring cleanup kind of thing because I had stains from the winter mold, but they got it done. They came up and did the work. They did the porch because the driveway is so small and they still had time left. They cleaned up everything and was gone."
1,"I called this company the week I purchased the deal in June of 2013, left a message and never heard back. I figured it was spring and they were probably busy so I would try again later in the summer. Later ended up being August and the same thing happened. I called, had to leave a message, and never heard from them. As of today I am out the $84 that I paid for this deal. Obviously, I do not recommend this provider."
3,"It was okay. That was 18 months ago. I was not necessarily very happy with the results of what they did. They just did seem like they completed the whole job. The price was reasonable, they responded quickly, but other than that, I do not know what else."
2,"It took numerous phone calls and rescheduling multiple times before someone showed up. I asked him to repair a rotten window sill after deciding to replace the sash chords myself. The worker who repaired the window sill was proficient. He was neat, on-time, and polite. The run-around with the father and son team was beyond ridiculous."
3,The service turned out fair. They came back once to try and fix the issue but the windows still leaks. They did try to rectify the situation. They came on time and did what they said they would do. If it wasn’t for the leaking I would have no problem with the service.
5,"The work was fine. I was going to have my son hook up the washer and dryer, but after talking with Jay he had said that he didn't come up with the price but it shouldn't be anything crazy for him to hook it up. He said they would call me to let me know the price. Well they ended up just sending me a bill and it had a an extra $158 charge on their that we had not discussed. I had already called a few other places to see what they would charge to hook up the washer and dryer if I had all of the parts. The pricing was around $60-$70. I have tried to contact the company several times to discuss this extra charge. I did talk to Michael on January 6th and they gave me a verbal quote of $220. Since then I have not heard back and I did call him on January 10th before I received the bill. I would just to hear from this company so that we can settle this pricing issue. Some of the things wrong with the service also were that he did not have a level to make sure the units were even. He forget to put anti slip pads that I provided under the washers adjustable front legs. He connected a hose that had holes in it to the dryer and glass box. I did tell him that my son would level it himself and that I would take care of getting the new hose. The cost of the additional plug was only $15 so I just don't understand the extra $158 charge. He also left out my 10% senior discount that is listed on his Angie's List profile page. Update 1/17/14 It is important that you have a firm understanding of what the charges are up front and make sure that you hear whatever the price is quoted. There was confusion on the price but it has since been resolved."
1,Bought the 3 hours but could not come for weeks and I needed a more timely response. The worst part was how much the man did not care about the whole thing.
1,"It didn't, no work performed, no calls returned"
4,"However, I had expressed some additional work that I was interested in getting done, they provided a quote, but when I decided not to get all the work done they quoted, I had a very difficult time getting them to respond on the work I did want completed. Trying to reach them was frustrating and I ended up going with someone else to get that work done,"
5,"We had a handful of spots in our home with broken drywall or areas that needed cleanup. They came in, were efficient and made everything look great (improved some of the stuff I did!)."
5,"Went well. he completed all tasks on my list, pleasant personality."
2,"Firstly, I would like to say Robert, who was the employee that did all the work ,was fantastic. I have no complaints with the work he did or him. He was professional, super fast, and did a great job. Bob, the owner, in the beginning, was responsive and offered a great service at a nice price. Hence the ""D"" rating rather than an ""F"" rating. Our original appointment was rescheduled, then the day of the rescheduled service the time was changed by the house doctors. You know, life happens, we wait for most contractors to be honest, they are kind of unpredictable; no biggie Robert came and efficiently and professionally did a great job. He was here for 1 hour and 45 minutes, he left and we waited for an invoice. We were set up for an hourly rate for our service. When the invoice arrived it stated that he was here for two and a half hours, confused as that was 45 minutes more than he was actually here. My husband called and left a message inquiring about the extra time (after complimenting the job well done and being totally polite). We received a short and dare I say snotty toned message from Bob saying that we were charged for travel time. I called the next day to ask why (in a professional non-confrontational way), as it is clearly noted on their advertisement on Angie's list that they do not charge travel time. He was rude, insulting and almost to the point of yelling at me over my question. I mean, fair is fair, I was charged 30% more for a service than I should have been, and as a responsible consumer, I wanted to know why. It wasn't a lot of extra money (the price was actually good for the nice job that was well done), but I found the upcharge to be underhanded. He explained to me in a very condescending way how we lived so far away that I should be glad I wasn't charged more and they ""bent over backwards"" for us. There are also 5 other jobs listed that were done in our area, so they do come to our area. Also, when the job was accepted my location was known by Bob and if he wanted to charge me travel costs he should have told me up front; especially since they advertise differently. The funny thing is I would have had no problem paying for travel time had I been told about it, and actually I did pay the bill in full. He was so unprofessional with me I felt uncomfortable not paying in full in fear there may be some repercussion for me not paying the full invoice amount, even though he told me not to pay it while he was nearly yelling at me and hung up on me. I worked in customer service for 22 years, I have never treated anyone like this and know I didn't treat him like that, it really bothered me. My advice if you hire this company please plan on having NO questions and No problems, as they may be handled very inappropriately and poorly . I also noticed a very similar review from another customer on this site about how Bob handled their complaint. Seems this isn't an isolated incident."
5,"The staff from the House Doctors are always great. The problem was fixed quickly and efficiently--a small, metal bottle opener had gotten wedge in the garbage disposal. It now runs perfects and the old bottle opener was trashed."
5,See above -- all went very well and I would use them again.
5,Mike did an amazing job. He came on time and did everything he said he would do. I would recommend him to my friends and family.
1,"Played phone tag for weeks, didn't seem interested in actually scheduling a job or wanting my business. It shouldn't be work for me to give my money away!"
2,"We first contacted the House Doctors in early November after seeing an add in the monthly Angie's list magazine for the House Doctors we made the initial phone call. We were contacted the week prior to Thanksgiving and told that ""they were doing gutters following week."" We were quoted $69 per hour. The Angie's list add stated $100 off for members spending at least $200. The week no one came or called. On Dec 9 received a call they would be there on Dec 10. On December 10 a gentlemen arrived. We were surprised to learn he was an independent sub-contractor of the House Doctors. There was never any mention that sub contractors were used. He was very polite and performed well, however, we should have been advised. The problem arose when it came time to pay for the service. We were quoted $69 / hour plus the materials; which consisted of one downspout elbow. At a little under 3 hours plus materials the total should not have been much more than $250. However, when the gentlemen contacted his boss from his truck and said he was told to collect $340. That is $100 more than quoted. There was a lot of back and fort and we were finally able to pay the agreed upon price. We will not be utilizing the services of the House Doctors again."
5,I purchased 3 hours of work for $111. The handyman arrived promptly and worked diligently for the entire 3-hour period. He did a good job and cleaned up the area when he was done. it was a big job for one person and he did a very nice job.
5,"House Doctors is one of the best companies we have ever worked with--every business should model themselves after House Doctors. They came within two days of my call to look at the job and give me an estimate; told me they would be out in two weeks to do the work; came exactly when they said they would, then would only accept payment after I confirmed that I had reviewed the finished work and was satisfied. The work was perfect. Would recommend this company to anyone."
5,Home was immaculately cleaned and passed my wife's scrutiny
5,"I was extremely pleased with their service. They worked me into an already busy schedule to help clean prior to my son's graduation party. Lori and her daughter worked really hard to get to all the areas I had requested they clean. They did an especially thorough job on the bathrooms and on my wood floors. They changed bedding in the guest room, folded the pile of clothes in one of my kids bedrooms and helped me with a few other things not typically expected. At the end of the day they made sure I was happy and that there wasn't anything else I wanted them to do before leaving. I have nothing but compliments for them. They were hard working, quick, careful and most important of all very pleasant and helpful!"
5,"Prompt, professional service, accomplished exactly what I needed as the coupon price which was excellent"
1,"I called and scheduled for them to come and clean my gutters. It has been 3 weeks and they have not shown up to do the work. I have also not heard from them. I just received a call from John stating that he himself was the one here that claims he cleaned my gutters 2 Tuesdays ago 12/17/2013! He stated he was told by his boss to do the best job he could as everything was frozen. I called to have this completed before Thanksgiving! The gutters are still full of leaves! It is not my fault they waited a month to come clean my gutters. They were NOT frozen when I asked them to clean them. They should have called me to reschedule when they were NOT frozen as this is CLEVELAND!!!!! Bob, I have a check made out to your company which I will be more than happy to give to you when the job has been completed properly and to my satisfaction!"
5,"The work was performed in a professional manner, the representative was personable, and very knowledgeable did an outstanding job and worked very efficiently"
1,"It was an Angie's List Big Deal that I purchased. It did not go well. I needed the job completed for an inspection. It was a violation on an inspection and I explained it to a guy named Bob. I told him that I was going to need pictures prior and he said that he would have to take down some of the drywall and replace it. I told him that I needed pictures while he was doing it and I needed it done by a specific certain date, which was the date of the inspection. According to my tenant, he showed up and started the job and then said that he would have to come back and then we never saw him again until a month later when he showed up to finish the job. It was 3 weeks after the inspection so I had to have somebody else finish it. They sent me a bill for over $700. They never called me and I kept sending them text messages to ask them if it was done or when it was going to be done and where the pictures were. They never responded to any of my text messages. I left voicemail messages and they never responded. I have no intentions of paying the bill they sent."
5,We had our plaster ceiling in the kitchen repaired. They repaired the |hole in the ceiling and painted ceiling. I would use this provider again but only if they had another special. The hourly rate of $65.00 per hour is a little dear for me.
4,"Purchased the deal in September. Played phone tag/email tag. Finally was scheduled then worker called in sick. Re-scheduled, quote was higher than expected and I backed out. Missed 2 days of work. They were very understanding in my wanting to cancel. I may do this at a later date, but not now."
5,"Serviceman arrived a few minutes early, was polite, and had materials, supplies, and tools with him. He did have to run to the home improvement store for something, but returned promptly. He worked quietly and efficiently for the three + hours and cleaned the area when finished."
5,They were very nice. Hard to make an appointment because they were very busy. The gentleman who came did a nice job and was very professional.
5,"This was a special - 2 hour $75. They were very responsive setting up the appointment and calling back when I had a question after. The handyman was prompt, clean and friendly. Better yet he was very skilled. He handled all the tasks listed in the two hours and then I had him look at some future projects. I felt I really got my money's worth. The company and the representative were very professional and I would use them again."
5,"Michael Rosipko did a fantastic job under brutal conditions. He was professional, informative and efficient."
5,Rod from The House Doctors came. He is always professional and did a good job cleaning out the dryer vent line. He was efficient and thorough.
2,"There were 4 half-dollar sized holes in my ceiling above my steps. They didn't patch them, they just put tape over them. They did not do the work that was contracted to be done, they were supposed to patch the holes up and prepare them to be painted. With the plumbing, it was a fiasco. I had contracted with them to replace all my pipes, they had to take the ceiling down and didn't replace all the pipes. and again, did not follow through on what they were contracted to do. I feel like they took money for one job and ended up doing something very different. I would not recommend them or not use them again in the future."
5,"The major item that needed taking care of and the report that I received was that the gentleman did a terrific job. I had some ceiling tiles that had been damaged due to water leaking from a toilet upstairs. He came in and replaced the tile that had been damaged and if I had found the same type of tile the job was done so good that you wouldn't know that it had been repaired. He also replaced the caulking around all my windows and patched some holes in the driveway. | |I will use again, I have a few more things that I need to have taken care of. | |"
5,My experience went very well. The staff was very professional and friendly while visiting. They are a great company. The pricing was reasonable and I would highly recommend them to others.
5,The workman had not seen our configuration previously--the gutters were actually glued to the fascia board. It required some maneuvering to fix the dents from the branches that had fallen against them and crinkled them plus damaged the gutter guards. The workman were pleasant and friendly. They did a professional job and made it almost as new. The House Doctors are definitely worth every penny I pay them!
5,"I've called Bob before to help me out with various repairs. This time, I didn't know in which category my repair needs would be. I know Bob and his crew did many things. So I called him, explained my situation, and he sent someone out quickly to fix them. My problems: my pickup truck lost its brakes one day as I pulled into my driveway and hitting the brakes didn't work. I continued into my garage and into the back wall, knocking a few studs off the base far enough that you could see the grass in back from inside the garage. A little while later, I pressed the garage door button too soon before I had pulled out far enough. The door came down and hit the top of the cap on the truck. It left a dent in the bottom of the garage door and knocked the garage door roller off the track. I called Bob in a panic, but he assured me he would get out to fix it quickly and I was not to worry. True to his word, I had someone here within a short time. You can't see where the back was repaired; it was done so expertly that even the siding on the outside doesn't show signs of ever having been damaged. He got the garage door straightened out and the roller back on its track. Except for a small indentation on the bottom of the garage door, it looks and works as good as new. It seems like the House Doctors can do almost everything. They've always been so responsive and professional. And they get the job done well. It reminds me of the Ghostbusters saying ""Who do you call? Ghostbusters"". But I say ""Who do you call? House Doctors!"" It helps that I was allowed to pay for it in 2 installments with no interest or fees, and I got a 10% senior discount."
5,"Overall, they are great to work with. There were at times some issues with some of the work. Given the scope of all the work we were doing, this is not surprising. What is important to me, is that they are responsive to feedback and concerns. Not only were they responsive, but the crew really went out of their way to address any issues that come up. We are continuing to work with them, and I would recommend them without reservation."
5,"could not have been better. I read on line about assemble of the shed. I knew that I could not do this, even with help of a friend. It is perfect. I have used them in the past and will continue to use them in the future. They stay in touch through out the entire process."
5,"See Above, Power washed the house, scraped, caulked, and painted the house and shutters."
4,"It went okay, I had to pay extra money for the second half of the house but they did a good job."
4,"Purchased the deal, try to contact them multiple times. No one answers the phone. Finally got a call and the earliest appointment is one month later. So I had to find someone else to do the work, thus want to cancel this purchase. Thanks."
4,Responded within a week and gave me a fair estimate.
3,"I bought a big deal coupon for the House Doctors. Someone came and did great work. I was happy enough with the service to purchase a second coupon. Unfortunately, after numerous phone calls, the company and I were unable to come to a mutually acceptable date for the second visit. I am averaging my good experience with my less happy experience to get the C grade (really more like a B-)."
2,My experience was dissatisfying. I called late in the season and they came to put the coat. Cracks and damage started to appear and I asked that he come repair the cracks. He said it was too late in the season and would not come back to repair the driveway.
5,"First they checked the roof and thought they had found the problem, so they repaired and painted the garage ceiling and wall, but then it rained and caused a big hole in the ceiling and caused the wall to bubble. They came out and looked at it and contacted a roofing expert, who said that we needed to replace all of the shingles, that it was caving in and would cause more problems if not done."
2,"I spoke with the provider about my job prior to purchasing the big deal and was satisfied with using them. After the purchase of the deal I did not hear from them, I called several times a week to multiple numbers and left messages but did not receive any calls for over a month. The last time I called, I advised that I was very interested in using their services and I was not in a hurry, but just wanted a return call to get an idea of when we could schedule, but I would have to seek a refund if I did not hear back. I bought the deal for 1 job, but I have multiple rental properties and have been seeking a new handyman to work with for future jobs. I was very disappointed overall."
3,"It all went downhill quickly after the initial six hour ""Spring Clean"". Since I was very pleased with the initial cleaning of my home, I scheduled The House Nurses for biweekly cleaning. The first of these visits did not go nearly as well as the initial cleaning of my home. Laurie, the owner, was accompanied by her daughter. Laurie did a good job with the cleaning she performed. However, she was not very organized, and did not seem to know what her daughter was doing. Tasks that I specifically noted as being a priority, such as low dusting of furniture, were not performed. When I asked about it, Laurie's daughter stated that it was done, but got dusty again after vacuuming. I was in the room, and I was sure that it hadn't been done. I can understand something being overlooked. However, I have a problem with lying about it. When they stated that they were finished, I was very surprised. Almost nothing in the living room had been cleaned, most notably the glass topped coffee table. When brought to their attention, they did clean the coffee table before they left. I would rather they had budgeted more time and did a better job of cleaning. I had expressed this to Laurie. Two weeks after this housecleaning, The House Nurses were scheduled to clean again. On the appointed day, they did not show up, and did not call to cancel. Very unprofessional!"
5,"We contacted the House Doctors for a handyman special for our house. After speaking with the owners about the house project, we asked them about a large drywall project at our church. They gave us a bid which was below some others that we had received and a couple of weeks later sent their crew to begin the project. The crew presented themselves in a very professional manner, were very friendly and open to suggestions for some minor changes in the project. They cleaned up after each day's work and were on time each morning to begin the work. The drywall project included installing firing strips, application of drywall, and painting. It involved working between 8 to 15 feet off the floor. The job was beautifully done and received quite a few positive comments from our parishioners."
5,"It was fine. I gave them a tip, but I didn't spend anymore than the cost of the Big Deal. They were very nice, they did their job and then left. I would use them again with an Angie's List discount, but their regular price, if I remember, is a bit hefty; so I don't know if I'd use them without one."
1,I am requesting a refund because they would not answer and return my calls.
2,"We called this provider, but they never returned our call."
3,"Both young ladies were delightful but explained to me that the service was a little unorganized since the owning partners spit and the staff was reduced by half. It was apparent that neither girl enjoyed the work but at least one of them attempted to accomplish the task. The younger girl was not at all experienced in the housekeeping field and needed total supervision from her co-worker. Nice girls but really unenthusiastic about their jobs. It was a little Disappointing, especially since they advertised it as Spring Cleaning. The service was simply light surface cleaning. I do hope the owner can get her business straightened out, she was very responsive to my calls and very accommodating with days and times."
5,"I love them. They are fantastic. I would recommend them in a heart beat. They went over and above and knock themselves out, we will have them back."
5,"Three crews showed up on schedule, and went about doing the interior, exterior, and 2nd floor all at the same time. All work was done very neatly, no flaws, and the crews cleaned up all the areas perfectly. All work done very quickly, and professionally. The manager came by the next day to inspect the work and ensure everything was done correctly."
5,He did a good job of painting. Clean up after the job. Was professional.
5,I am very pleased with the work done by the House Doctors. The workers were always on time. They were polite. They cleaned up everyday when they were done. They kept me informed about what was going on. There was a lot of sanding and scraping to do. I was amazed how well they cleaned up all the dust and paint chips. They did a great job tuck pointing and painting the walls. The epoxy floor looks outstanding. The basement looks 100% better. Brian always returned my calls if he was not avaible. He explained everything that was being done. He worked around a few days when I was not avaible. I will use them again when I have a problem.
3,"There are a lot of reasons this review should be more positive. However, the problem for me was in the communication. When the handyman showed up on the 19th (Mark) he could not have been nicer, more professional, and the job was fantastic. He called ahead to let me know he was running a little late, cleaned up meticulously, worked very fast and carefully, and was flexible in working with me as I got materials for one of the jobs. Also, Bob, the fellow who communicated with me via email was responsive and helpful. However in the interim between one of the fellows (Mike) who was supposed to have taken on my job did not respond to phone calls, left messages to call him and suggested times to do so but then did not pick up the phone, so that was frustrating and I lost time with that. If I had not already bought the big deal I would have moved on, but I had paid for the work and needed someone to do it. We finally talked on the phone, and Mike very kindly fit me in to work with my schedule. I understood we were to meet on Aug 16th sometime between 10 and 11:30 a.m. Mike called me on the 15th and asked me to call. He did not say why, but I wanted to speak with him anyhow because I wanted better information about the time of arrival. I called several times with no response. I left messages that evening explaining that I would be leaving work the 16th and asking Mike to let me know a more exact time so I would not miss as much work. I got no response. The 16th I traveled the 50 miles round trip to be there at 10 and while waiting there called him a few times again to ask what was going on and again received no response. I waited until 12:30 and then left still havign heard nothing. I emailed Bob that weekend just to let him know what had happened and got a response immediately. The problem was fixed on Monday when I traveled the 50 mi round trip again to meet the fellow Mark who did such a great job. Apparently, Mike and I had understood different dates. I can understand such a situation. I cannot understand a refusal to call to tell me we had miscommunicated so that I would not travel out there the 16th for no reason. So I am left in a quandary. The work was outstanding and the workers very pleasant to deal with except for the communication issues. If I had the time to spare and did not have to travel so far I wouldn't hesitate to try them again, but I probably wouldn't risk it since both are an issue for me."
5,"He worked very hard. It was a nasty, dirty job, and I was very pleased with the results."
5,It worked out great. I was very pleased. He was very courteous and punctual.
3,"I bought the coupon and Bob called soon after. At that time I told him I wasn't ready but had several things I wanted done. I emailed him photos and a list of things I needed done. He never responded. I called and left a message with no response from that either. In the meantime I had to have this work finished so hired another handyman from Angie's List. Towards the end of the coupon validity time, he called but the work had already been finished. I gave him a ""C"" because he did call right away, but he should have responded to my email and other phone calls."
1,never responded did not show up for the cleaning no calls nothing
5,"Rod, the electrician came to evaluate job. He was timely, professional and polite. The evaluation took minimal time and I received a quote the next day. Bob Vecchio scheduled work with me when I got quote and repair was completed that week."
5,"It took a bit to finally set an appointment, multiple missed calls, on both ends. Would be nice if they had a ""live"" operator to handle calls. Had an area on kitchen ceiling that had been repaired, plastered a number of years ago due to a leak. No reoccurrence of leak however area started to crack, looked as if a repair had been done, not very smooth, kind of ""drooping""...Purchased a 3hour plaster, drywall repair back in April. Mark arrived on time, had called to inform me what time he would be starting.. I purchased supplies needed for the repair. I was given 2 options of repair work, decided on the least invasive option, after discussing what the best choice would be. Mark did a great job, protected furniture in the area where the work was being done. He finished the job quickly, ceiling looks great! In the end, he didn't need some of the supplies I purchased as he had some of his own available and the job didn't require too much. All questions answered. Would definitely hire again."
1,"Service provider never showed up when scheduled. This was a huge inconvenience to the member, please refund immediately."
5,Everything was done timely and neatly.
1,"I left two messages on each of the phone numbers listed in the last two weeks and still have not had a return phone call. I understand that this company might be busy, but at least an appropriate response would be professional."
5,"They did a very good job. Bathrooms, especially, exceeded my expectations. There were a few areas they missed, but after I pointed them out, the team immediately fixed those areas. I initially had a dificult time getting in contact with the House Nurses, and didn't receive a call back after several messages left. However, they had a wrong number for me and once we realized this, the housecleaning was quickly scheduled."
5,It did take a while to get on their schedule but I'm sure they get busy in the spring/early summer. They arrived on the scheduled date and time and completed all the work in a timely manner. They even came back the next day to haul away the old broken gate.
3,"Generally, I would say they were very courteous, but the cleaning was only ok."
3,"I hired these folks to come wash my driveway. Our snowplowing service left some rusty trails on the driveway during the winter and I wanted the spots cleaned off as well as the driveway powerwashed. After purchasing an Angie's List Big Deal from this company several months ago, they were quick to contact me and set up an appointment. They were willing to come sooner, but I asked them to wait until June, after we mulched, as I knew the mulch pile would leave a big mark on the driveway that I wanted cleaned off. A rep from the company called me the morning of the appointment to make sure they could still come out and perform the work, as it was raining that day. I said it would be fine, as long as they could wash our driveway effectively in the rain. She assured me it would be fine. I appreciated her professionalism. She said they would arrive between 10:30 and 11:00 to do the work. At about 10:15, a young man showed up at my door. I was on an important phonecall and not ready to come outside since he was early. I apologized for being on the phone and asked him to wait a few minutes. He didn't even crack a smile or say anything to me. He just walked back to his truck. About 10 minutes later, I finally made it outside and asked him to start on our driveway and then move to our sidewalk and patio when he finished the driveway. He was unfriendly, slow moving, and unprofessional and barely said two words to me. It just seemed like he wanted to be anywhere but powerwashing driveways. Hey, I didn't blame him, but it did reflect poorly on the company. Last fall, I had another power washing company come out and wash our whole house, all three sidwalks, and our driveway as well as seal the driveway. Two workers performed all the work in about 2 hours. So I thought just having our driveway washed would easily be accomplished in one hour. However, the young man from the House Doctors was extremely slow moving, and the equipment he was using was a small hand sprayer. I peeked out at him from an upstairs window a few times while he was working, and it looked like he could have been working a lot faster. However, I did realize that the equipment was also a hugely limiting factor. It was obvious to me after about an hour that he was not going to even come close to finishing our driveway alone in two hours. My children and I went for a bike ride around 11:30, and returned home a few minutes prior to 12:00. The young man from House Doctors was sitting in his truck with all the equipment packed up, ready to leave. I was annoyed because I had paid for 2 hours of time, and he hadn't started working until around 10:30, so he was shorting me a half hour. But mostly I was annoyed because he had only managed to wash about 1/3 of our driveway and had not even come close to working on the sidewalk or patio. I told him he hadn't started working until around 10:20, and asked if he would get the equipment back out and at least try to go over more of the rust spots on our driveway. He said he didn't realize he hadn't started until 10:30 and he got the equipment back out and worked another 20 minutes. In the end, he managed to mostly remove some motor oil stains and helped fade the rust stains at the top of our driveway. However, the bottom 2/3 of our driveway were not cleaned at all. I was so disappointed that he accomplished so little in two hours. Even though I purchased this service through a Big Deal sale, I felt like I was ripped off. I did not feel like the work he performed was worth the $69 I paid! After the service was performed, I got on Angie's List to read their other reviews and realized the company is not a powerwashing company. They are handymen. I had not realized this when I purchase the Big Deal, as they were advertising 2 hours of powerwashing. Perhaps their customer service, efficiency, and professionalism are better when they are doing other types of work. I would definitely NOT recommend this company for their powerwashing services."
5,They called quickly after I purchased my Big Deal to arrange a time to come out. The young man who did the work was efficient and professional. Knew what he was doing and kept at it until the job was done. we had more work to do than could be done in the time allotted by the big deal and he gave a good estimate of how much more money/time it would be.
5,He did the work and he had extra time and asked what else he could do. I would use them again if I got another big deal.
2,"We have an old house. We purchased the faucets and shower and had replacement tiles. Approximately four or five had to be changed for the new faucets. Robert came out to do it all. He was very polite and a hard worker. However, he seemed uncomfortable with the tile work. He was pounding on the tiles with a hammer. After the first trip he needed to order an extension for the faucet due to the thickness of the wall. My husband noticed that there were eight or nine new tiles which had been cracked and chipped. He told Robert about this and he said that he wasn't finished even though he had already replaced adjoining tiles. He came back two days later with the extension and installed the plumbing and worked on the tiles. When Robert was finished, my husband noticed that some of the tiles were sticking out or in farther than the others. Also the spigot beneath the faucet was not lined up with the faucet about one inch to the right. Robert explained that it was impossible to line up correctly because of the construction of the wall. We didn't think that made sense. We were not to use the shower until the next day. The next evening we tried it out and black water came out from around the faucet and then more water came straight downstairs through the ceiling to the downstairs bathroom. I called Bob Vecchio and said we needed someone immediately. He didn't return our calls, so we called Robert and he came right over. It turned out that he had attached the faucet to an old pipe and didn't try it out. He redid it and it is currently working. In the meantime we had received a bill from Bob Vecchio for $829 for the work done so far, including replacing 12 tiles. I called him to ask about being charged for 12 tiles (not a good job) and the fact that the faucet and spigot didn't line up. He refused to talk about it and said Robert had explained everything to my husband to his satisfaction. Not True. He never bothered to come and look at the job. He also said it would have taken too many hours to get the tiles right, this being such an old house. He said most people with old houses would have all the tiles redone with ""liftoff tiles"" He was very rude. We decided not to have them complete work on the shutoff valve and ceiling repair as we didn't feel confident they would get it right."
4,"Took long time to set up appointment. Patio looked good when completed. Technician polite,"
5,My mom was here when the work was done. She said the worker was very efficient and offered excellent and cheaper options.
5,"Excellent experience. When the workman were late, they called to let me know. They were friendly, cleaned up after themselves and checked with me as the work progressed. This was another excellent experience with The House Doctors!"
5,"Plumber showed up within an hour of my call, and he repaired a toilet flushing device in our bedroom area. Pieces for this particular toilet are hard to find, but the House Doctor plumber did the whole repair within an hour."
5,"The post was on a porch that had been replaced some time back by the House Doctors. It turned out that the roof of the overhang was empty inside. A new ""panel"" had to be added to the overhang to secure the post."
1,Had to call twice before calls were returned. Finally got a call back and they said they would look at my driveway for a quote on re-sealing and leave estimate in my mailbox. No estimate ever given.
5,I was going to have the light replaced so I could have brighter light... but the electrician said we could just use a different wattage. I have used this company for several years. The tech (Rob) was very prompt and the service was great.
5,"They were absolutely fantastic! He arrived on time, went out of his way to protect the rooms from dust, cleaned up after and the work was great. We would definitely use them again!"
5,"We have some moisture in the attic, and a hole in the drywall. Mark comes on time, and did a wonderful job. He's very professional and efficient. He fixed the drywall, and even helped to spray bleach on the attic to prevent mold. We would definitely recommend it. Besides, before the job, we communicate with Bob over Angie's List. He's very helpful. A very respectful company and we highly recommend it."
5,They did a great job! The house smelled great when I got home from work. They wiped down all the surfaces in the kitchen and took care of the dishes. Folded laundry in the bedroom that was left out and organized the dresser tops. The kids rooms were organized and cleaned as well. They took care to use a vinegar solution on the hardwood floors which was greatly appreciated. Definitely planning on using them again.
2,"The first thing I was told, before beginning, was the area I was most concerned about, would probably not come clean. I expressed my disappointment in this, and that area actually did look pretty good. There are several other areas, two that are very obvious to me, in the front of the house, and both of these areas did not come clean. When I asked about these, I was told that was as good as he could do. I showed him, the one area that I could reach easily that I could get it clean, which I proceeded to do. I have cleaned these areas in front of the house before. He proceeded to show me in another area on the side of the house that if he put the hose almost touching the siding, it would take the paint off, and it did. There are other areas that are still dirty, and are difficult for me to reach. I have had my house Powerwashed before, and have been completely satisfied. Not this time!!! I do not feel this was a good deal!"
5,The only reason I would not use them again is that they were too far from where I live. The gentleman did a great job. I thought it was expensive but I really have nothing else to compare it to.
5,It was really good. They did an exceptional job.
5,Very well! Contractor actually beat me home to do the work was about 15-20 minutes ahead of schedule. Was very professional went right to work and completed the worked quickly. He cleaned up and took all trash to garage as requested. I found some other needs that I am going to call again to get their assistance. Thanks for a great job.
5,"They were a little difficult to get hold of and scheduled. Not terrible, but a little difficult (don't bother with their email) but once they were here they were great. I should also say nothing I needed done was an emergency. Jim came on time, cleaned up as he went, and was very professional. His carpentry was very good. We had a problem with the door and called back. They were very responsive and quickly returned to correct the issue. We will definitely use them again."
3,Not a good experience.
1,"I scheduled a time for them to come and do the work, but they didn't show up. I have been calling to confirm the date, but they have not gotten back to me. I scheduled in May and they weren't able to get to me until Aug, but they never showed up or called to tell me they were not going to be able to make it."
5,The fellow (Mike Rosipko) arrived on time and did all the prep work. He then crafted a beautiful wood gate for my yard. It was exactly what I wanted and needed. It was all done quickly and perfectly. He then hung an item for me (that I could NEVER have done properly). I would use this company again. I was so impressed by the efficiency and quality of the work. Mike was super and had really good suggestions.
1,"The House Doctors wanted to charge me additional prices and I felt they should have been able to do the job within the 2 hours that I paid for. I wasn't home when they did it and when I came home I couldn't tell where they stopped. They didn't do the whole job but I couldn't tell where they had done the job. I wasn't able to tell which part was clean and which part was dirty. They told my son they used water instead of any kind of cleaning agent so I'm glad I didn't pay the extra whatever they wanted per hour, 100 and some dollars. Their hourly rate was too high and I just felt it was a scam. I'll give you 2 hours for $69 but it's going to take 2 more hours and it's $169 or whatever they were going to charge per hour. I don't recall having any problem with The House Doctors' punctuality."
3,"First off, let me be clear that the service professional that came to my house was very nice and did the best work he could with what he had. I am pleased with what he did, but I paid for 3 hrs of work and he left after 1.5 hrs. I am however, extremely disappointed with the manager's, communication, responsiveness, and overall way that he does business. I purchased the coupon in early May and was actually interested in receiving a quote from them for additional work, however, after several phone calls over a 2 week period to the house doctors, someone finally returned my call while I was at work and left a slightly nasty voicemail stating something to the effect of ""if you don't call me back today by 1:30, you won't get scheduled for a couple months."" I am a nurse and not permitted to carry my cell phone with me during the day and after more than 2 weeks of in-returned calls, I certainly did not feel it necessary to take time away from my patients to check for messages. I checked on my lunch break at 2:15 and called the manager back. He proceeded to schedule me for July 12th, regardless of the fact that in the meantime, we actually had some damage occur to our living room ceiling that needed repaired in a more timely fashion. He asked what we would want done and I replied, ""well, if it's not until the middle of July, I'll probably just have you do cosmetic work and I will find someone else to do what I really need done."" His attitude was very ""oh okay, sounds good, see you on the 12th"" with no apology for the late call, however he did offer an excuse, stating ""we've been really busy. I've sold over 200 of these coupons."" This truly makes me want to stop using Angie's List, at least not even consider a coupon or deal, knowing that providers do not put a reasonable limit on the number sold to be able to serve the customers that actually purchase them. Final note, I asked the scheduler on the phone if they would come do an estimate and he said that they would do an estimate day of service for any work above the budgeted hours (which is not what I wanted, but I truly didnt want any work from them at that point, let alone any additional work, so I didnt push it). I then asked if there was anything that I needed to have for the serviceman when he came to the house and the reply was ""no, he'll have everything with him."" Upon arrival to my house day of service, again, the gentleman that came was very polite and did his best, however he immediately asked me if I bought drywall mud. I told him ""no, I was told I didn't need anything."" The guy only had joint compound with him and he made it work, however, the corners are no better than they were before and I had to do all of the finishing work because the compound had to dry for 24 hrs before being sanded. If I had known that it was only going to take him 1.5 hrs to do the work, #1, I would've run to Home Depot to get the stuff that he actually needed and #2, I would've found more work for him before he left. I was planning on painting my whole house, he could've prepared all the walls for me in that amount of time. Overall, it was a waste of $99. I could've dine the work that was done easily on my own for a lot less money and possibly even better quality because I would've used the right materials."
2,"On May 28, an electrician arrived from The House Doctors and put in the new line (it was an extension cord), installed the camera (did a very nice job with it) and installed the motion-activated light on my back porch. He said I needed a new kitchen faucet and a new ceiling fan and that he didn?t have time to do the other jobs. (This cost me $470 and I had to take the day off from work.) When he left, I thought the electrical line and the security camera were ready to go. For the next month, I had nothing but trouble with the security camera; it kept going on and off and wouldn?t record anything. The security company was very patient with me as I made many, many calls to them to help me get it going. We, of course, thought that my cell range was the problem so, as advised, I bought a second router for over $100. My brother then discovered that the line put in on May 28 by The House Doctors was dead. After playing telephone tag for a while, they finally made an appointment to send the electrician back to see why the line was dead. He came back on July 9. Since I had to take another day off from work, I took advantage of the time at home and asked him to fix the dead line; install a new porcelain light fixture in the basement; and re-screen the back window while I was there. After a couple hours, he told me he fixed the line and that if I had any more trouble with it, I should call the garage-door-opener company that installed the original box. He also installed the light fixture in the basement and re-screened the window. (This cost me $250 and another day off from work.) The camera continued to go on and off and did not work properly at all. The security company told me to send it back and they sent me a new camera. Meanwhile, my brother discovered that the electrician had run the ?new line? into a line that switched on and off with the garage lights that I controlled from my house. I had to leave the lights on 24/7 until I could have the electrician come back to ?fix it? (again). I contacted The House Doctors about this on July 25 and a new electrician was sent out on August 1 (I had to take two hours off from work). His first comment was about the extension cord used by the first electrician. (The first electrician had told me that adding conduit would be much more time-consuming and costly, so I agreed to the extension cord.) The second electrician worked on it for about half-an-hour and said it was fixed. I tested it (I thought) and it seemed to work but after he left I turned the lights on and off from the house and the camera stopped working. I immediately called him and he came right back. After a minute or so, he said he finally realized what was wrong. (It had something to do with the relay in the box installed by the garage-door-opener company.) Once he ran the line through the relay, the camera worked perfectly. (I hope I worded all this correctly ? I?m electrically challenged.) The owner of the company called that night (August 1) to ask me if I was happy and that he wanted to ?put a smile? on my face. I was smiling until he added, ?You know, I could charge you a little for that work today but I?m not going to.? Seriously? After two months of aggravation for me (and my brother), not to mention the expense and time involved (two more visits by electricians and another ten hours of vacation time; the unnecessary purchase of a second router; numerous phone calls to the security company; uninstalling the first camera and shipping it back; and installing the second camera, I was astounded that the owner would even hint that I should pay for the less-than-one-hour visit by the follow-up electrician. This job should have been done correctly the first time the electrician came out on May 28. After all this, none of which was my fault or the fault of the first or second security camera in any way, the son of the owner accidentally sent me a copy of an e-mail he intended for his father in which he referred to me as ?a pain.?"
2,"After filing a complaint with Angie's List on 7/8/2013 about a repair to brick molding (which was coming apart, developing black mold, and leaking water into my house) around my sliding glass door, I received a call from Bob Vecchio from the House Doctors on 7/12/2013. He indicated that he wanted to ""make it right."" However, he would not be able to do the job himself as he no longer does his company's jobs due to the fact he has had a double knee replacement. However, he would send one of his guys to fix the work, and he would get back to me to schedule an appointment. I would have preferred to hear that he or his son would come out personally and fix the job on a weekend so that I wouldn't have to take more time off work, but that was okay as long as the job would be fixed right and in time for the outside of my house to be painted. During the week of 7/15, Bob and his son, Mike left messages for me. However, due to a family emergency, I was unable to call back until 7/22. On 7/22, I returned Mike Vecchio's call to schedule the appointment to fix the brick molding around my sliding glass door. At this time, he indicated that he would send the same individual who did the initial work. I expressed concern and asked for someone else since this individual didn't repair the job properly the first time. Mike interrupted me and said it would be fine. He said he talked to his guy, and they discussed what should be done. This surprised me since Mike never saw the work (even though I offered to provide pictures in a previous voice-mail). I went ahead and scheduled the appointment with him for the next morning since I needed the work to be finished before my house was painted on 7/24/13. Approximately 30 minutes after my call with Mike Vecchio, I received a call from a 2nd carpenter who was referred by my painting company. During the week of 7/1 when I didn't hear back from the House Doctors, I contacted my painting contractor for a carpenter referral since my house was originally scheduled to be painted the week of 7/8. However, due to rain, the painting did not start until 7/24. The carpenter said he could stop by and look at my job in the next half hour as he was finishing up another project in the area. I agreed to have him look at it. When he and his partner saw the molding around my door, they explained that the job was not done properly and that the molding would have to be replaced. They said they didn't understand why 1/4"" round molding was used at the top of the brick molding to keep water out. Instead, they suggested using flashing. Also, one of the corners of the molding was not secured causing it to come apart. They also indicated that there was way too much caulk used around the trim. It was quite messy. However, despite the excess caulk, water was getting in behind the door and getting into my house and causing black mold to appear on the outside brick molding and the 1/4"" round molding. They explained they would need to replace all of the molding around the door, scrape off all of the caulk, and install flashing under the siding and over the top of the molding. Labor and materials would cost $250.00. Since I had confidence they would do the job correctly and since they could do the job the next day, I agreed to hire them. I immediately called Mike Vecchio back to cancel my appointment. When I got his voice mail, I left a message indicating that I was hiring someone else to complete the job and the reason why. I also mentioned that I'd like to talk to him or Bob and request a refund for the initial labor and materials. However, I did not receive a call back. I only knew that he must have received the message when no one showed up the next day. On 7/26/13, I called Bob Vecchio to follow up and request a refund. Bob returned my call that afternoon. He seemed angry, and he told me that he didn't think I was being fair since I did not give his company the opportunity to fix the job. I tried to explain to him that I was willing to do that. However, when the 2nd carpenter indicated that the job was not fixed properly and since the House Doctors were only willing to send the same individual who did the job improperly the first time, I preferred to have someone else do the work. Unfortunately, Bob interrupted me and talked over me multiple times. When I requested a refund of $167.58, Bob said he would offer me a refund of $125.00 because he felt the materials probably didn't need to be replaced. However, he had never seen the work and wasn't interested in seeing pictures that I offered to provide. He said he would refund me $125.00 if I changed my review on Angie's List. The House Doctors has since refunded me $125.00. the total cost of my repair was $292.58 ($250.00 to the 2nd carpenter and $42.58 paid for some of the materials for the first repair). At this point, I'm grateful that the repair is now properly fixed, looks great, no longer leaks, and that I received some of my money back to defray the cost of the total repair. Since Angie's List does not allow for half grades, I had to rank my experience as a D for the grade above. However, since I received a refund of $125.00, I would say that my overall experience was more like a C-/D."
5,"I did use The House Doctors and that one turned out excellent. They were neat, clean and efficient, I have no problems whatsoever. They even suggested areas that needed to be repaired and fixed those also."
5,"Robert from The House Doctors did an excellent job, was professional and got the job done in a timely manner. I needed the work done by a certain time and it was done well in advance of my deadline."
5,"They did a terrific job locating a part for a very old dishwasher, then modified it to fit. I would definitely use them again!"
5,Did a replacement of a damaged ceiling and painting with trim added and repair of paneling in family room. Replaced drywall in living room and hall. Patched cracks in bedroom. Installed lighting in family room. On time all the way cleaned up as they went along and entire job done within 1 week.
4,It was good. I never saw them do the work. They completed everything while I was gone. It was not as thorough as I would have wanted.
5,"He was ok. He did a good job but, he was a little slow."
5,Went well. I happened to have some extra wall anchors to secure handrail into wall.
5,"Bob is always very responsive when I contact him. The guys he hired were friendly and called the day before to let me know they were working in the morning. They arrived as planned and worked around the cars in the neighbor's drive to remove ivy. They tried to match the tuckpointing color & talked to me about possible future repairs for the steps. They went through thorny berry bushes to get to the old wood fence to take it down. They then put all the debris in the truck. They were friendly, courteous, efficient and thorough. They checked with me on every job. I would hire them again and will hire them again. They are the best!"
5,It went fine- I was not at home when they did the work.
5,"One of the crew was sick, but came anyway since I was having a party in a few days. Did forget their rags, but ran out and got more. Very good attention to detail when cleaning. I was pleased."
1,"Everything went extremely well, in fact, it went so well that I have decided to take my time a write a review. I very much enjoyed the responsiveness of The House Doctors' automated pre-recorded answering service. It literally answers without hearing that phone tone... on all 4 lines listed under contacts. Super cool! Oh yeah, the recorded voice quality is simply stunning. So I left several messages... and left several more two days later. Only about two weeks later since my initial contact I had a privilege to finally play this interesting game called ""phone tag with Bob"". I really don't have a job nor do I have life so I simply sit on my couch and desperately wait for that precious call from Bob to establish a direct line of communication and finally... it paid off. Bob called my cell and I picked up! Hurray! The arrangement was made for some one to stop by and inspect the problem. Unfortunately I wasn't home (I don't work... remember?!) but my wife happened to be home. Now Im quoting my wife: ""some guy of barely legal age to work came out and took photos."" Well, a week and a half later since the ""very young man"" took photos, Bob left a voice mail stating the estimate was sent. You know Bob, I appreciate the effort, but at this point, I kinda started to like my leaking home and the damaged dry wall along with the water damage in my 3 car garage ceiling."
5,"Jim came here for three days. In 90-degree heat, he worked diligently at scraping and painting the garage. When a sudden rainstorm came, Jim just waited it out by sitting in his truck. We asked him to come inside the house for ice tea during the rain, but he preferred to wait in the truck. He was very neat, polite, and pleasant."
5,Good he did a great job and provided pointers
4,"Getting to the first visit took some time so I gave them an average grade for responsiveness. Once the repairman arrived, everything went very well. He did a very good job and cleaned up well. He did the ceiling touch up, too."
2,"I called for a deck repair estimate. I received a call from Bob who said Mike would call and set up a time to provide estimate. Several days later than stated, Mike called back. We made an appointment for the estimate. He was on time and professional. He called back with the numbers and description of work 5-7 days later. When I called and said I wanted to schedule, he said he would email a contract. Didn't hear from them for weeks. Never received contract, just another phone call asking if we received the estimate. By this time I had contacted someone else and sent in their contract."
5,"It went amazing they not only did everything we asked, they also took initiative and cleaned or suggested ideas not even thought of. They really go above and beyond and take their jobs ver seriously. I will call them in the future again and again!"
1,Called twice (approx. one wek between calls). Never did hear back from anyone.
2,"I don't remember the details or when these people were here - a couple of years ago. They came and looked around for our water source. We are on a well and have limited water pressure. they should have asked about our source of water before they came- We would have never ordered the service, knowing they would have to use our water. i thought they brought their own water in a water truck. The job done was most unsatisfactory - I just wanted them to leave before they used up our water. Terrible idea to hire this company."
1,We have found services elsewhere.
2,"Three teen girls arrived who looked as though they had been told at gunpoint that they had to clean this house. I had talked to a mature sounding woman and thought she would be coming. They sped through the two story house in two hours and then told me I owed them for 3 hours because they thought 9 am to 11am was three hours: 9, 10, and 11! I paid them for the 2 hours from 9-11 am. Someone had set a bathroom cleaner bottle that contained bleach, sitting on the hardwood floor in the hall that left bleach marks on the wood. Someone who worked upstairs picked up a throwrug without cleaning it and dumped it on a built in bookcase and left it there, dirt and all. They barely cleaned inside the kitchen cupboards. I had left them there to run a few errands and when I came back, the whole house smelled like they had spilled a gallon of air freshener throughout the first floor. There were one or two ants on the floor due to heavy rains that year, so they told me the house was infested. That's a lot of money to pay for some excessive air freshener and 3 surly teens."
5,"GREAT! When I explained to the owner that the front door issue had a safety factor, he happily expedited my service call. The gentleman that came out was extremely competent and very nice...he handled all my jobs quickly, and was professional throughout. He cleaned up after himself, and did not go overtime (as this was 2 big deal coupons). The front door issue was particularly tricky, and he made it work. Will use again! THANKS!"
4,"The House Doctors - Bob Vecchio - followed up on our calls and rescheduled the pressure wash. He sent two of the nicest young people who spent the time and took the care to do a great job on the house and garage. And this was on one of the hottest days when the temperature in the afternoon was in the 90's and probably felt like over 100. In fact, I would have understood if House Doctors had called to reschedule on a cooler day, just to look out for the safety of their people. At any rate, they did a super job. My husband was especially excited by the job they did pressure washing the back of the garage where some green algae had been creeping up the back wall. It looks like new again. We are very appreciative!"
5,"Did a very good job power washing front walk and stone path around garden area. Courteous and professional. Did not call before coming over to do the job, luckily I was home."
5,They were fine. They were very helpful.
5,"Everything was fantastic! Quick reponse from the first phone call - they promptly returned my phone call and scheduled an appointment time within a week. Robert arrived on time and promptly knocked out my entire to do list in record time. Before finding the The House Doctors on Angie's List, I had a hard time trying to find anyone to simply return a phone call. The House Doctors are now in my speed dial and will be my first call for upcoming house projects. I have already shared their information with my friends!"
1,"I purchased a 2hr. certificate for Handyman work from the House Doctors on April 27, 2013. Called to schedule an appointment the week of June 10th. Reached the House Doctor and was given an appointment for June 17, 2013. On 6/17 I received a call from Bob Vecchio stating that his handyman was on his way but en route the truck broke down and he would have to call a tow truck for service. He stated he would call me that evening (6/17) to re-schedule. However, he never called. I called back again 6/18, 6/20, and 6/24 with no luck of a reply! As of this day (7/8) I have not received a call back to re-schedule an appointment or been offered a refund of $89.00 for the purchase of the service certificate!"
1,"I needed to have the wood trim around my sliding glass door replaced and also there was a section of the facia board that needed to be replaced as well. They came out and did the work, things seemed to be fine. The wood, where it is connected, is coming apart and water pours into my home when it rains. I contacted the company to come out and fix the issue and left a voicemail. I never heard back from them so I called the second number that they have listed and again got no response, I have left messages on both numbers now. I am needing to have the issue fixed before I can have the exterior of my house painted. The wood trim around the door still needs to be stained and painted before the exterior painting can be done."
1,"I have tried twice to reach them and each time have gotten their answering service, but they've never returned my calls or messages. I won't be doing so anymore, I'm getting a refund."
5,Repairs were excellent. Good craftsmanship.
5,"They did a great job! The house that they worked on is around 100 years old with a lot of wear and tear throughout. Because of the age of the home, each time the crew would try to accomplish something, they would find further problems below the surface. They handled each situation with skill. They are very courteous and professional. The price was very reasonable considering the amount of work and age of the home. Lastly, I would like to comment on their ability to get the job done within the time frame stated. We would definitely use them again."
3,"The repair was fine but I was not really happy with the pressure washing. They showed up, and they were fine. The fellow finished it in two hours and my complaint is that I could have done the same with my host. He basically just host down my deck."
5,i knew if I hired Bob he would come to water the flowers and garden while I was away. Of course he did. He did not charge me for a weekend when it rained. I chose Bob because he is reliable. I can count on him.
5,Went well. The couple that came out were very friendly and professional.
5,"I had lost faith in all handymen, until Bob came to the rescue!! I have been readying my house to sell. This meant doing a number of home improvements, most of which were simple enough to tackle myself. However, when it came to replacing some cracked grout in my ceramic kitchen floor, I wanted someone with more expertise (and a greater ability to spend all that time crawling around on the floor!!) I called a number of different handymen services. Some of them didn't bother to return my calls. A couple actually came out to see the job and provided quotes, but then wouldn't return calls to schedule the job. When I called Bob and explained the situation to him, he jumped to action. He was very understanding of my time frames and promised that he would not abandon me like the previous companies I had called. Bob stayed in contact with me, calling me multiple times while he was working to schedule someone to come to my home. Within two days we had an appointment scheduled for the following Sunday. He called again on Saturday morning to confirm the appointment. Later on Saturday, I received a call from the actual handyman that was coming to repair my grout, Robert. Robert asked if it would be possible to stop by that evening to look at the job so he could make sure he had everything he would need the following morning. I agreed. Once he arrived and assessed the job, he provided a quote on the spot. We started to talk about the schedule for the following morning. When I mentioned that I had a family get-together to celebrate the return of my nephew, he offered to do the job that evening so I would be free for this important family event. He left to get his tools and 30 minutes later started working on the grout. He removed all the damaged pieces and regrouted the floor. Two hours later, the floor was done, cleaned up (as clean as you can make a freshly grouted floor) and I couldn't have been happier. The job was done less than a week from initially calling Bob, and for a price that was better than the two quotes I had received. My faith is restored!!"
5,"They called me to schedule a date/time and asked in what order I would like things powerwashed so that they made sure to get what I wanted done in the amount of time the Big Deal allowed for. The employee arrived on time and checked in with me at intervals to again make sure he did what I wanted in the allotted timeframe. Even more was done than I expected, and he did a good job. I am very pleased with the service received for the price paid."
5,It was delayed a couple days but he called me and explained which I appreciated. The work was done in a timely manner and the work was very well done.
5,"The work was done well and professionally. This service was scheduled after several phone calls, a slight delay apparently because it was a busy time of year for this service. The work was done very well, and the technician asked questions about what was wanted as needed. He even said that there was some time left in the hour we were paying for, and was there something else he would like us to do. He then cleaned the concrete area near the front door at no extra charge."
4,"It was an okay experience. The second story above my garage could not be reached. The rest of the work was fine, but I should have been asked beforehand about the second story above the garage."
1,they did not show up they do not call back. they take the money and run
1,"It went terribly. First, they arrived about 1hr and15 minutes late. When I said ""You guys are late! I was expecting you about an hour ago"" their response was ""yeah....."". Then, I asked them to clean. They did a terrible job. I continuously had to point out areas that they missed and had to remind them not to take short cuts. They didn't even move the rugs I have on my kitchen floor to vacuum/mop underneath them!! They kind of work they did was absolutely appalling."
5,The work was efficient and professional. Work was well done.
2,"They ended up showing up a month earlier than scheduled. They ended up sending a guy out who couldn't do the job that was required. He was very courteous and did a good job with the work that he did. However, I hired the company to wash the high points of my house and they never brought the ladders needed to do that. I ended up calling the business to let them know, and I still haven't heard back in week."
5,"Responsive to my requests. Went well. Two workers budgeted their time appropriately. Cleaned a stove top hood which required climbing on a ladder, countertop which I couldn't do. Next time I would specify that i wanted stove top cleaned - which would be time consuming. I didn't specifically request it this time, so it wasn't done. They cleaned my floor meticulously without drenching it in water (wood) and in several areas one of the workers scrubbed the floor on her hands and knees. My knees hurt watching her."
4,A few places not done even though I called them to their attention. some places not swept that should have been
5,They did a great job. The porch and patio look great. They offer great value.
5,"They did an excellent job, they were very punctual and professional. You name it - it's the whole nine yards with this company. I'd highly recommend them and would use them again for future needs."
5,"They were there when they said they would come and they did the work they said they would perform. I didn't have a lot of interaction with them, but it was a fine job and the price was good."
5,"Matt was on time and did the jobs neatly and quickly. Tho I hadn't mentioned the wooden benches there was a little time left and he fixed them. I will use them again for a number of different projects I have planned. He answered questions I had about those future projects, some big and some small."
5,"I purchased an Angie's List Big Deal special offer for this service and they did an excellent job. My advice to others is to call them up and get them in. Pricewise, it was a pretty special deal."
5,"I was very happy overall with the work completed in 2 hours and for the money paid. I wouldn't have believed the difference power washing could make to my deck which was obviously much dirtier than I had anticipated. The north facing siding of my home was heavily stained with algae and looks great too though there are a couple of places where some light staining remains. It may be that power washing alone can not completely remove stubborn algae stains? This is the only reason I gave a B for quality. I have chosen not to rate punctuality due to the circumstances at the time. The work had originally been scheduled for 5/1/2013 but due to a medical emergency within the family the appointment had to be re-scheduled. I was advised that someone would ring to re-arrange within a few days but instead they turned up late afternoon on the 6th and asked if they could do it then. Luckily my husband was at home and he agreed. This was not a problem for us at all and, to be honest, was sooner than I had anticipated."
5,"I rated them A because of the effort they made. The initial contact was fine and a date was set for the pressure washing (with outside window washing by another company scheduled for 3 days later.which had to be rescheduled as well.) But the pressure washers never showed up. Before the scheduled appointment, there were about 4 phone messages left asking what was to be done. I answered all messages, only to get another questioning message a few days later. Annoying. After waiting for them all afternoon, I left them a message that I needed to be rescheduled. The office said I would be contacted. . A very nice lady returned my call, saying they had not come because of an illness and rescheduled the appointment. Before the appointed day, I got another message from the same person who had made the multiple questioning calls that a crew would be out on yet a different day than the one the lady had scheduled. I returned his call and left a message saying his date was wrong and they were expected on the day the woman had set. Needless to say, they did not show up on the appointed afternoon. At about 6:00 p.m. I called the office and left a message saying that if I had not already paid for the service, I would certainly be cancelling them. Since this was the third appointment they had not shown, I was not nice. About 45 minutes later, a very nice 2-man crew arrived to pressure wash the house. They did an excellent job, were courteous,. and appologized for the lateness of their arrival. They said the person who was ill was the scheduler. When that scheduler returns to work, I hope they give her a raise. Apparently she does an excellent job but has no backup. They apparently are lost without her. (The office had called the washing crew at home and sent them to do the house after hours. It is for this effort t hat I gave them an A, since that was certainly above and beyond what I would have expected.)"
4,"I purchased a two-hour handyman coupon on 4/23. I called the company via the phone number on the coupon and left a message on 4/24. I received one phone call back later on 4/24 from Mike with a voice mail asking me to call back. I returned the call to Mike's phone number that same day, made another call to the phone number on the coupon on 4/28, and sent an email on 5/13, but I did not receive a response. I left a voice mail each time I called the company. I requested a refund through Angie's List on 5/17 at which point I provided this review with an initial grade of D. After the review was posted, I received a phone call from Mike on 5/25 and a call from Bob on 5/27. Mike's message indicated that he never received a phone call from me. However, I double checked my phone bill to ensure that I called the correct phone numbers. Bob apologized for the delay and explained there was a medical emergency during the delay. He offered to rectify my situation by offering an extra half hour of work. I returned Bob's call on 5/27 and left a message indicating that I would accept his offer if it was not too late in the refund process. After speaking to Bob, we agreed that it was too late in the refund process to accept Bob's offer. However, he offered to honor the extra half hour if I purchased a new coupon for the service. Following receipt of the refund for the initial coupon, Bob and Mike called to get my work scheduled including the extra half hour The work is now scheduled for 6/14. Jim, the handyman, called an hour before he was scheduled to arrive on 6/14 asking to reschedule for the next day. I agreed to reschedule, and he arrived on time the next day. When Jim arrived, I showed him the rotted kitchen cabinet floor that I wanted replaced. He then went to Home Depot to obtain the supplies using a gift card I had purchased. When he returned, he went right to work. The cabinet now looks great! Additionally, Jim was pleasant and professional, which made for a nice experience. Jim finished within two hours, so I did not end up using the extra half hour Bob offered."
1,"Scheduling: Before I made an initial call, the House Nurses began calling my home and telling my daughter that I had to schedule quickly becasue my offer was going to expire. Once I called and left a message, calls continued to come to my home instead of the cell phone number I left. Since I work during the day, I did not get the messages until after close of business. I got to the point of leaving a message that I would request a refund and find another company if I did not hear back in 2 days.Once I was able to contact the company, scheduling was easy. On the day of scheduled services, I called when no one arrived by 30 minutes after the scheduled time. No call back, so I called again when no one was there an hour after the scheduled time. This time I got a call back from the owner advising that the people coming to clean my home were in a car accident. We rescheduled for the following Monday. This was an inconvenience since I had to then clean on Friday night before weekend guests arrived, but you certainly cannot predict a car accident. On Monday, two workers arrived at 1:15 pm. My daughter was present and kept our dog on a leash in another room with my husband (My husband had a stroke and is not very mobile. We wanted the cleaners to be able to move freely between the rooms they were cleaning, so planned that the master bedroom not be included in the cleaning.) My daughter called me at about 3 pm and asked if there was anything else I wanted cleaned becasue they were just about done. She explained that the ceiling fans would not be cleaned because the cleaners did not bring a ladder. I asked my daughter to go over the list with them and make sure they did not forget anything. The cleaners left at 3:30. Whe I arrived home I was looking forward to see a clean home. Instead I saw smeared cupboards in my kitchen and waste baskets sitting in the middle of the bathroom floor. Light fixtures in the bathroom had not been cleaned or dusted and the doors had not been washedand there were cobwebs in the laundry room and front hall, so the walls and ceilings had not been dusted.. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. I called the House Nurses the next morning and explained my disappointment. Initially, the owner said she had a 24 hour guarantee policy and I could get a refund or she could come back and correct the problem. I asked her to come back becasue I wanted my house cleaned. She called me back a short time later and told me she would not come back unless I paid additional charges. She told me that I was not entitled to six hours of cleaningsince two people came to clean and she did not agree that two people working from 1:15 to 3:30 was less than six hours of work. She told me to write a bad review on Angie's list if I wanted to. This was surprising because I had never had this kind of reaction. I commented on this voicing my surprise that she did not care about negative comments about her business. She told me her business was fine and she never gets complaints and that I should just clean my own house. It was as though I was speaking to a different person. I can understand that someone may not clean to my standards, especially if they are willing to complete the work that was paid for, but this is no way to treat a customer."
4,"The work was fine, he did a good job. He was very quick to respond."
5,The faucet was 13 years old and I just could not turn it off. I called Mr.Vechio and he sent the plumber out the next day (that was the first I was going to be available). All went very well.
3,"On the surface everything looked fine. Upon further inspection, I realized that bathroom rugs were moped around, the shower floor and walls were not clean, the ceiling fans were not dusted, and there is a wall of mirrors that wasn't cleaned at all. I assumed that since cleaning was the job that i didn't have to follow the workers around to make that the job was done properly. Additionally, I was otherwise occupied. I would make it a point to pay closer attention the next time i have house cleaning work performed."
5,"They did a good job. I figure that coming for the very first time, you might want to go above and beyond to wow the customer. They didn’t do this, but did exactly what they said they would, which is fair."
1,I believe the House Doctor is getting too busy and doesn't have the man power to service all the Big deals he is offering. I am hoping that some day he will return my call after four failed attempts
4,Overall it went pretty good. Had to end up paying over the deal I knew it would be over however. I wasn't too happy with the amount of time that it took but they did a decent job. The gentleman Mike Rosipko is a great guy.
5,"We called the House Doctors on Monday, May 13. Bob called back to discuss the problem. That evening his son called to make an appointment. He said they would be near our house the next day, so Jim came in the morning and made the repair. He was very polite and professional."
5,"Although I didn't use them because of timing on my part, they were very attentive to my needs and will use them in the future."
1,"The House Doctors sent their employee on 4/24/13 to pressure wash the front walkway and driveway. The surfaces were washed while it was raining, which made it very difficult to view the quality of thier work. Upon inspecting the job a few days later, I noticed that they blasted away the top finish of my concrete driveway and front walkway leaving the aggregate surface below. I called Mike Vecchio and explained the problem. He was unfazed and insisted that the pressure they used would not penetrate paper or cardboard and that the result was ""normal"". I pressed further and requested that he inspect the job. Mike arrived on May 11th to inspect the job. His attitude was poor and dismissive from the start.....he further insisted that the result was normal and did not admit to any damage despite that fact that I showed him areas that had not been pressure washed which still had the top concrete surface and compared them with the ""after"" effects of their pressure washing job. His arrogant attituted shone thorugh again as he insisted that they were blamess. Mike did not offer a refund or offer to fix my driveway and walkway surface. I've spoken with real concrete experts and they've asured me that pressure washing should never remove the smoothe top concrete layer. The damage done is permanent It will csot me over $500 to have the top surface sealed, as the top surface damage cannot be easily repaired.....will cost at least $2,000 to have a top coat applied. I'm beyond unhappy...........this company is careless and clueless about their pressure washing services. Do not use them.............I may pursure other legal solutions if we cannot reach an agreement!"
5,The House Nurses LLC answered all my concerns prior to the visit. They were punctual. I loved that they brought their own cleaning supplies because they knew which cleaner went with which material. Their vacuum was the high suction model that I have heard good things about. Someone walked in my house UNEXPECTEDLY the next day and first thing she said was Your place looks so clean! I wanted everything cleaned sanitized and disinfected but I also wanted everything sparkly. Her compliment proved my house looked great! Lori is a great listener and I will request their cleaning services again!
5,If you have older siding don't expect miracles.
3,"Overall, not well. I will have to have someone else come and redue the cleaning."
5,This was an overall good experience and we would use House Doctors again for this service.
4,"Purchased deal for 2 hours of pressure washing. Due to volume of business for this deal, vendor informed me that they would not be able to schedule service for 12 weeks. Requested and received refund. Vendor was understanding of this problem."
3,I purchased their spring cleaning deal from Angie's list. They arrived on time and overall did a good job with one big exception. When they cleaned the kitchen I specifically asked that the oven be cleaned only to find that after they left and I went to use the oven they had only whipped down the outside. This has left me a bit disappointed in the service.
5,The work was fine. They did what they were supposed to. They were pleasant to work with!
5,"It was an Angie's List Big Deal that I purchased. I ended up spending an extra $30 because they had to stay a little bit over. They were fine. It was a really hard job and it was tougher than it appeared at first. He had to take extra cuts and measurements on the door hinges in order to get it to work. The only thing I didn't like was that it took longer than I anticipated but that was not their fault. The doors were extremely heavy. The price was in line and probably less than somebody else would have charged. They were right on time. They were very professional. The only drawback is that you need to supply your own materials. I had the materials for this project because I was trying to do it myself but for future jobs, I might not always know what materials to get. I want them to install lattice work with chicken wire but I don't know what to get. They will come and do the work but I have to supply everything. It would be nice if they would come out and let me know what I need ahead of time."
5,The work was adequately done. The work they did was great! We were very pleased with the work.
5,"This experience was great and the response time was immediate. The young guy that did the work was just great. He was very nice and professional. He did exactly what I asked for, and I was very pleased with the work and the level of professionalism. I would use them again and I would recommend them as well."
3,"The person that they sent to my left me in very concern of whether he was a plumber or not. He looked around, I had water leaking through my wall. He knocked out my wall saw all the water, climb down and started to tell me that all of the problem was caused by something in my home. Now they leave and tell me they couldn't do anything until I get in touch with the association of my condo. I did and call them back to get in touch with me just to see if they would come back to fix my wall. I never got a return call."
5,Appointment set up was easy. Showed upon time. Completed work. Did not have to be home.
5,I was well pleased with the work he did. He worked so quickly that I had to find other work to do to make up the 2 hours that I had pruchased.
5,t couldn't have gone better and I certainly do recommend them.
5,Went very well couldn't have asked for mort I wil definitely use them again
5,"Overall, the job went well. I plan to call on them again for other jobs, thankfully I don't need anymore doors hung!"
5,"I love them because they do a great job. If they see something that needs to be done, they let you know. I've been having bird issues and fixing the roof is part of the solution they proposed. Bob (the owner) really listens to his customers."
3,"This coupon was a waste of money. Angie's List did me no services this time around. Unfortunately, I purchased the coupon in March and it is now almost May and I am still waiting for my two hours of powerwashing. First, they took almost a week to just call me back after I contacted them with my coupon code. When they did call, they did not ask me what would be a good time and date; they just told me when they would show up. Unfortunately, they didn't do that either. Understandably, the weather was iffy that day, and some areas had snow. However, my area did not, and it was well above freezing. i might have understood, but they did not call to cancel. I had to contact them and leave a message. Almost two hours after they were to appear, they finally called back. We set a date for the following Saturday. Again, they did not show up. This time, the young man who was to perform the service had family health issues. However, they did not call to cancel and I had to call them and leave a message. Over four hours after they were to appear, I finally heard from them that they were not coming. The owner said that he would call the next evening or following morning. Two days later, I am still waiting. I understand illness, weather and set backs. What I don't understand is the total lack of professionalism with which this company deals with this. Is this the only person who can powerwash in the entire company? Angie's List- I need help here! Work was finally done and done well. I sincerely hope their issues are now resolved and they will be able to get to their customers in a timely manner. Thank you, House Doctors for coming through."
5,"I'm n the process of selling my home and wanted all the little settling cracks fixed. I bought a big deal for $99 for 3 hours of work. The drywall expert sent to my house noticed some cracks that I hadn't even noticed because he knew where to look. After he filled the cracks, he smoothed the drywall so well that the repair wasn't apparent. Then he found the paint that matched each room and touched up the repair for a perfect match."
1,"She took 48 hours to call me back. She then scheduled to come out today, which was great. She told me that she would be out between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. I called her at about 11:48 because they never called me to tell me they were going to be late or anything. She told me that she had a family medical issue going on with her daughter. I thought it was potentially unprofessional of her to schedule to come out to my house when she had this impending medical issue going on in the first place. I decided to get a refund on the deal."
3,"After sale the owner told me that they do not do roofs. So I went for just the siding and patio. After 2 hours of cleaning nothing changed except that the patio looked better,"
5,House Doctors did a very good job. Since it did not take the full time to do the house they also did my detached garage. The house looks much better.
5,"The total experience was amazing! I hope that I will be able to secure a place on The House Nurses schedule for bi-weekly maintenance cleaning. I would also like to mention The House Nurses' superior customer service. First of all, The House Nurses initiated contact the day after I purchased the ""Big Deal"". All communication was extremely polite and professional. My personal preference was considered of utmost importance in selecting the date and time of the appointment. I then received a call to confirm the appointment on the evening before the date of the appointment. On the morning of the appointment, I received a call from Laurie stating that the cleaner scheduled to clean my house was ill. Would it be possible to reschedule for the following day? I explained that, although I am usually flexible, I had already stripped my bed, and my husband and I are both physically unable to lift the mattress in order to remake the bed. Laurie then assured me that my housecleaning would take place that afternoon. At 11:00 A.M., Laurie called to inform me that she was on her way. Laurie and her assistant arrived before 11:30 A.M., just one half hour later than originally scheduled. Superior Cleaning+Superior Customer Service=The House Nurses! A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
1,We called this provider several times! We were given a quote over the phone for $5500.00 to get our two bathrooms remodeled. We asked to have the quote in paper. It has been 2-3 weeks since that phone call with no quote in writing or follow up. We are tired of waiting on this provider and seeking to take our business elsewhere.
5,"We purchased an Angie's List deal for two hours of handyman work and were very pleased. We had two overhead light fixtures in the kitchen that needed to be replaced. The ceiling was very tall and the lights had not been installed correctly from the beginning so it made things a little more complicated. We also wanted them to install a new fan in the bedroom. Nothing was easy with the kitchen lights so when the two hours were up the fan had not been installed. The worker stopped and gave us the option of whether we wanted him to stop or continue and we would be billed for the time it took to finish the job. Because his work thus far had been such a good quality and the price to continue was very fair - we opted to have him finish the job. The handyman, Michael Rosipko was great. The fact that it took longer than we had originally expected was due to the improper way the lights were originally installed. Michael worked very hard and fixed the problems correctly rather than just hurrying to finish the job. He was pleasant and very professional. We could not have been more pleased and will not hesitate to use their services again. It was so nice to have someone that wanted to do the job right. Michael was that guy."
5,"Jim arrived on time and did pretty much everything that I needed done. Although I bought a discount couponf from Angie's list for their services, they didn't make me feel like I was getting less serice. JIm just went from one project to another. Very efficient and I am very happy."
5,"Great job, arrived on time and required no supervision. Work looks great."
5,"The work was done in a professional manner. The workers were punctual, carefully moved and covered the furniture as needed when painting and cleaned up the debris generated by the work."
1,Never returned after two visits to give estimate for siding and door threshold repair.
5,I was pleased that they were able to schedule me as quickly as they did. Mike R. was extremely courteous and went above and beyond to explain the best way to remove the mirror tiles and improve the overall appearance of the wall. He and Mark were able to finish the job quickly and were very careful to ensure there was no mess once they were done. I really appreciate their time and effort on this project.
5,"Handyman Michael Rosipto arrived right on schedule and removed his boots at my front door. I showed him the materials I had bought for the jobs (screen, spine, and weatherseal), and he went right to work. The work was pretty straight-forward, except for the kitchen door leading into the patio room. It had never closed completely right because the deadbolt was misaligned by a fraction of an inch. I just asked Mike to replace the weatherseal, but I heard his electric screwdriver from the other room. I was pleasanty surprised to see he made the deadbolt align properly. The door now closes better than it has for twelve years. He also gave me some ideas for some other little problems that have been bugging me. Overall a good experience."
5,"Overall, I was satisfied with the service provided. The service provider was very punctual. Because I was unable to be there for her service visit, I left a list, per level, of areas I wanted addressed. I appreciated the attention to detail shown to the second and main levels of my home. It appeared as though the lower level went lacking and perhaps this was due to running out of time. I would absolutely use this company again and recommend their service to others."
4,"For spring cleaning, my expectations were rather high. The woman who made my appointment was very courteous and professional. Two very nice women arrived punctually with their own cleaning supplies. They needed no direction and were in my home (less than 2000 sq ft) for 3 hours each (total 6 hours). They did the basics -- dusting, vacuuming, scrubbed floors, cleaned 1-1/2 bathrooms. Although they did this well, I was expecting them to also do small things like dust picture frames, clean a vanity mirror in bath, and a cabinet top in the living room. It was worth $99, but I would not have paid the regular $159 for this service. I would have tipped them if I thought they did more than the bare minimum."
5,the above paragraphs explain the process.
5,Everything was great and we had no complaints.
5,"They did ia very good job, I was very pleased."
1,They couldnt be bothered to even return phone calls
5,"Jim arrived on time and worked efficiently every minute of the 2 hours purchased. His workmanship installing the crown molding in my kitchen is precise and professional, with NO waste of materials. There was a lot of cut work and every angle was cut and nailed with precision. Jim was polite and worked quietly the entire time he was in my home. He cleaned up EVERYTHING prior to leaving. I am palnning to remodel my basement this summer and put in a family room. My hopes are to have Jim return to do the work. Thank you for a pleasant experience. Jim was expected at 10:00 am and called well in advance to let me know of an emergency family situation that would require coming later. He politely asked if it would cause problems for me."
5,The House Doctors responded quickly and came in the evening to accommodate our schedules. It was another excellent experience. The electrician was friendly and professional. The work was completed quickly and he cleaned up after himself. You cannot go wrong with The House Doctors.
5,"I'd had House Doctors work for me before, with a great experience; at that point, they redid my closet, installed a lot of cabinets, and fixed some rotted woodwork in an exterior window. When I bought the Angie's List deal this past week, I got a phone call within 24 hours, letting me know of a cancellation for the next day. When Jim came out that next day, he got right to work, did a great job on all the little jobs I needed to get done. He was very professional and had good ideas on how to get things done. I'd recommend Jim, and House Doctors to anyone."
4,"From the first calling to set up an estimate to the job comlete it was good. They called to let us know they were on he way and were on time as were the phone calls. They stayed on the job, ate on the job and all clean up was good. This work was done on Dad's house approx. 03/23/2010. House has been sold and I don't remember all the specifics. For the work they did for us I would use them again."
5,"It went well overall. Very good service, nice to work with. I would highly recommend Lori and her daughter, Heather."
5,"Cannot sing their praises enough...VERY RESPONSIVE, Arrived right on schedule, extremely professional in every single way! They got the work done fast and not a scrap left in the yard, actually cleaner than when they arrived! What a great team, so friendly and considerate in every single way. Use this provider, I highly recommend!"
2,"I had an appointment for a Saturday afternoon. He was late so I called and was advised that he had forgotten to write the appointment down in his book. He did arrive a short time later. I provided all the materials for him to spray the bathtub. The paint was white, but the tub looks yellow. I'm not sure, but I'm thinking he did not shake the paint can long enough. I could have replaced the tub for what it cost me to have it painted however, I had all the materials to paint it. He did not complete cleaning up the area as well. There was a my bucket left with water and a rag and there was masking tape left on the faucet as well. The invoice was for $25.00 more than he quoted however, I did not pay him the additonal $25.00."
1,I called and emailed multiple times without any response. I decided to get a refund from Angie's List.
5,"She came on time, started immediately and left everything immaculate."
5,"Excellent experience. The guys are very friendly and navigated tough stairs and impossible angles to take out the old water heater and put in a bigger (75 gallon) heater. They were prompt, professional, friendly and cleaned up after themselves. It could not have gone better. I would (and have) used them for an array of household projects. These guys are the best and had to be very patient because I was traveling so much. I appreciate all that they do and they are well worth the money."
5,"He arrived promptly, was courteous and professional, and did a good job.Based on this experience I would hire this company again."
5,"The drywaller from The House Doctors came out to our house for two days at the scheduled time. He was very pleasant, and we were impressed that he's done work for The Historical Society, having been trained by an oldtimer. His work was great -- you'd never know it had been done, which as he pointed out to us, is exactly what you want."
1,"Never got past phone calls. I left a detailed message with my phone number. Did not hear anything for 3 days. I called them and some guy answered the phone with just a hello - never identified the company or himself. I asked if this was the House Doctor and he said yes but seemed confused on the Big Deal offer. At that point I said I didn't have a good feeling and would go elsewhere. I also said he might get a bad report. He said do what you have to do and hung up. Very crude individual, very unprofessional."
1,"I contacted House Doctor after purchasing Big Deal by phone. I left a detailed message with a return number two times. Three days went by with no reply. I called again and some guy answered the phone with just, ""hello."" I asked if this was the House Doctor and he said yes. I asked why he answered with just a hello versus identifying the business. He ignored the question and wanted to know my name. I told him I was calling about the Angie's Big Deal and he seemed not to know what I was referring to at first. At that point I told him if that's the way he runs his business, I'd rather go somewhere else and that he might get a bad review at which point he said, ""Do what you've got to do"" and hung up."
4,"Teh did take a few days to get back to me. I wanted to have some faucets installed and a couple of odd jobs completed. They informed me that they do not do faucet work, so I decided to get a refund."
5,"Began work on Wed., and completed work on Friday. Did a very nice job and cleaned up afterwards."
5,"Had a bit of a slow start with a delay in coming to view the job, but once that was done everything went well. The workman was very polite, neat and I really appreciated that he did not make/receive cell phone calls while he was here. He focused on the job at hand and was finished in about three hours."
4,"Very prompt; met with tenants; completed an estimated and the required work. Tenants were very pleased with work and interactions with the worker. Sent bill upon completion of work, would use again."
5,He arrived on time if not early and was very professional and completed all work that we talked about.
5,"Called for arrangements, came promptly, friendly, tidy. Checked daily on work being done."
5,They did an excellent job and I would recommend them.
5,Work was completed in the estimated time and within budget for materials.
5,"Beautiful job, scheduling was easy. Professional all around. Asked for the same technicians I used before."
5,The technician worked quickly and efficiently. I was very pleased with how quickly I got an appointment. The price was very reasonable. Will definitely recommend them to family and friends!
5,"Steve arrived on time from Pennsylvania, even though the weather was very foggy that day. He analyzed the work to be done and I said the closest store for parts was Home Depot. I explained that Lowes installed the door in 2004. I took a picture and went to them first for repairs but they said they don't repair doors. However, they recommended Angie's List for a handy man and to use treated wood or PVC material for door framing. Steve returned with a door frame kit. He said the material was wood but seemed unsure if it was treated. He repaired the frame which took 4 and 1/4 hours and he allowed me to use a $25 coupon. The caulk had to dry before we could close the door. When dry, I tried to close and lock it with a key using my body weight to push hard but it would not close. I opened the main garage door and was able to pull hard and lock it from the inside. I called and he came back the next day. I was unsure if I was being charged $124 per hour for him to fix it correctly and I was honestly afraid to ask. He didn't say but either way I knew it had to be done. After two hours I told him I had to get back to work. I asked how long would he be? He told me he wanted to make sure it was done right and to my satisfaction. I told him to call me if he needed me and left him to finish. He already had my credit card info if needed and I asked my tenant to try the key in the lock when he was done. I came back on my lunchbreak a couple hours later. The frame was fixed, he cleaned up the area and he was gone. My tenant said the key worked great and there was no other charge."
5,"Rick did an excellent job. He was professional, friendly, and got the job done quickly. I was very satisfied with the work."
5,"Very well done. The technician arrived on time, with all necessary materials. He completed the work quickly, and the work was well done. I first used the services of this company in 2018 when I moved into this area, and have always been very pleased with their work."
5,I had acquired quite a list and really needed help. Butch and Steve were professional in their work and demeanor. They even cleaned up before they left with a vacuum! I am most impressed with their skills and talent but so pleased with their personal attributes. No worries here. They are my go-to guys!
5,"Excellent first experience with Mr. Handyman. Prompt, professional, quality service."
5,"It went great. Ted is truly amazing, he always goes above and beyond. He put the wooden hut up in a very timely manner and made adjustments with the wood to make it user friendly. Then he went on to our roof and walked around to see the shape that our roof was in, all the while giving honest friendly advise. Mr. Handyman of Northern Baltimore County is a great operation from Lynn to Rayne on the phone to the outstanding owner Mark. They are a first rate company. And I am very grateful for them."
5,All work done was excellent and met/exceeded my expectations.
5,"Prompt, professional, if they are going to do a job they are going to do it right. You get the level of service you pay for."
5,Great service and value. Office was responsive and friendly. Technician offered solutions and delivered quality work.
5,"Everything went well. I am very satisfied with the work. The technician Ted came to my home and after brief consultation, got started right away on my job. I appreciated the recommendations he made to save me money and he did a fantastic job. I will plan to utilize this wonderful service for my handyman-y needs."
5,Recently had my bathroom remodeled and Mr. Handyman did a wonderful job updating my powder room!
5,"I had so much difficulty finding a company to repair my siding instead of replacing it. I spent nearly an entire day calling companies, and each of them declined my project until I spoke with Mr. Handyman. They were very responsive to my needs, pleasant to work with, and they didn't care that my project was small. They had it finished within an hour, and I received a one year guarantee on the work completed. They followed up and followed through using email and did it promptly. I had it figured out and schedule for the next week in no time! Overall the entire process was super convenient and I plan on using them again. Highly Recommend Mr. Handyman of North Baltimore County!"
5,It was very good! Just a quality work.
5,"The techs did a beautiful job. I love my flooring. I love this company, easy to schedule,techs are professionals and never disappointed"
5,My technician was awesome. Love my new floors. His craftsmanship was top notch. Completed the project much quicker than I expected and was able to return several boxes of flooring due to very little waste. Will always use Mr. Handyman of Northern Baltimore County.
4,"I thought the price was high but the technician was experience, professional, polite, and efficient, and went above and beyond within the first hour."
4,Job done well but cost too high for type of service
5,"I've always gotten great quality and service from Mr. Handyman. Be it installing an attic fan, installing outside lighting, fixing a plumbing connection, fixing holes in drywall, or even staining a deck, the professionals at this company are always providing great quality of work. I've been using their services for the last two years since moving to Northern Maryland, and I always go back to them for work."
5,"The pantry in the kitchen used to be an exit out of the back of the house. It was half-assed renovated. My beloved Rich, who has done a number of projects for me, came in. Tore out the ceiling finding that above the ceiling was somewhat open to the elements - skeletal remains of birds, mice, lots of leaves all hanging over our pantry food. Rich re-vented the closet, cleaned out the toxic stuff, replaced the ceiling and then built out a new pantry with enough shelf space for everything I needed. Rich always talks to you first to make sure he understands what you want and he offers great suggestions for the best way to do things. During the project he becomes one with it and in this case spent a lot of time talking to the closet as he did the work. It is perfect.. And exactly what I wanted and needed. Office staff is also boffo in scheduling and is very responsive. Please note that Mr. Handyman is a franchaise. This review is for Mr. Handyman of Northern Baltimore County.."
5,Work was performed very competently and efficiently.
5,"It was very easy process, the estimate was quick and easy and done on the phone. The man that came to do the work was pleasant and professional and accommodating. Very happy with the service performed and I will hire them again"
5,"Office staff provided excellent service when I called to get information. They spent a good amount of time answering my questions and explaining the services they provide, as well as the pricing. I received a call when the tech was on his way. Teddy arrived and I went over the work to be done. He told he'd get it taken care of lickty split and he was not kidding. Not only did he perform the work, he performed exceptional work in handling my repairs and went above and beyond to ensure the soffit and siding were secured to prevent them coming off in the future. I look forward to having them perform work again at my residence. So much easier and much cheaper than some of the other estimates I received for the same work."
5,"Spectacular. I can't say enough good things about this service. The people who answer the phones are helpful, prompt, courteous, and very flexible in their appointments. The technicians who do the work are prompt, reliable, and extremely high quality in their workmanship. This is an amazingly high quality service, with a great breadth and depth of abilities. I can recommend them without reservation. Wish I'd found them years ago."
5,"Teddy arrived on time, and was not just a pleasure but a joy to have over, he did an incredible job installing our hut, and worked meticulously to do it well. I am completely satisfied with his work, and that of his company."
5,"Love the work they did for a very reasonable price. Will definitely use them again, very easy to schedule and the work was exceptional."
2,"I did not hire them because the rates are very high. $174 for first hour and $124 for each hour after that and can be billed in 15 minutes increments. They also charge by the hour to shop for your supplies and the is a mark up charge. Also they don't come out to do free estimates, you have to send them pictures. I would recommend."
5,"Rich was terrific. He was going to be slightly delayed, so I received a call from the office with an update (before he was scheduled to be here), which I appreciated. Rich was amiable and knowledgeable, and he made sure to get my input/approval before making any decisions. He was careful but efficient and didn't take longer than necessary. The work actually took less time than the estimate. I would definitely hire again!"
5,"Jay was amazing ..he had to return to finish the job. My building had someone moving out and would not let us use the freight elevator . Granted I did not know that their would be a need for it,so I had to reschedule the work .The building can be very difficult for contractors not on the buildings preferred list. Jay did an amazing job on the doors even with constraints that were out of his control .The job was much better than I expected,very pleased .I will be requesting Jay for the installation of a tub & shower door.I have been using numerous contractors for renovation of our badly outdated Condo .it has been one nightmare after another ..Mr Handyman is so easy to work with .Scheduling is so easy . She is really positive & professional ( I should know her name but it escapes me) I If I had only known what an amazing job they do . I would have used them more for projects I have already contracted.Mr Handyman does a professional job at very competitive pricing ."
5,They did a great job and I have already recommended them to a co-worker for deck repairs.
5,"Everything went great. Rich Weiss was friendly, professional and prompt. I would ask for this technician again."
5,"Mr Handyman and especially Rich again provided prompt, professional, quality service. Highly recommended!"
5,Great!!! Very pleased with the tech. I WILL hire them for additional jobs!!!!
5,My experience was a positive one. The handyman was professional and knowledgeable. The work was done without delay. I requested price quotes for possible future work which was emailed to me the very next day. I would use Mr. Handyman again.
5,"We have used Mr. Handyman of Northern Baltimore County for a number of jobs over the last 9 months. Rich Weiss is my go to guy. What I love about this company is that they will think with me to figure out how to best approach a particular problem. Last job: Environment issues in the house. 70 down stairs and 80 degrees upstairs. Rich closed off some ducts, opened others, repaired broken ones and at this point the temperatures are equalized throughout the house. He also built a set of steps off my dock with a crank to get it up and away from ice. Fixed the downspout, the front door, the security lights, and then talked to me about how to fix the position of the awning on our back porch and options to replace sliding glass door. The latter two project will be done later in the spring. Everything is always done at a high level and I so appreciate the out of the box thinking. I will just keep coming back because the cost is reasonable and I can get a bunch of stuff done at the same time without having to call in different ""specialists."" Hard to find a jack of all trades anymore. The office is also easy to work with and gets back to me quickly to get the work scheduled. Top notch group all the way around."
5,"The technician was very professional, he did wonderful work at a reasonable price. Love my new bathroom, would definitely hire them again!"
5,Would definitely use again. A very customer oriented company. Very responsive when you call. Easy to schedule and liked the flexibility when I had a conflict. The serviceman was on time professional and did a beautiful job!!!!
2,"First of all, i pulled up in my parking lot after going to Lowes to get the caulk & spray paint, He was sitting in his van. So I stayed outside of my condo bldg & checked my mailbox & looked back again & he was still just sittinng in his van, Mind you he was already ten min late, So i went back & started to walk to his van & he got out & said r u Mary? i said yes & he said he had trouble finding my bldg, So when we got inside, i asked him when does the clock start, when he pulls up or when he actually starts the work. He said when he first pulls up. So now, im like 20 min in the hole without him even starting any work. He worked very slowly, Then he said he needed to go out to his truck to get something. He stayed outside for another 15 min or so. I didnt even see him bring anything in with him. Now the price we negotiated at the beginning of the deal, he said he charges $176,.00 for one hour. I did agree to that. He did finally finish the task but the caulking on the sink was sloppy & he left one corner of the mirror untouched. He then asked me if he could have the brand new bottle of caulk & spray paint i had just purchased from the store. I said no, i may need it. But what kind of contractor comes to do a job caulking a sink & doesnt have caulk with him? He didnt think i would have any & then he would have to spend an extraordinary amount of time visiting the hardware store to purchase some & the clock would still be running on my dime, I asked him if he had any caulk in hi truck & he said no. He also assured me he would get the job done within 1 hour so i dont have to spend extra for more time. But, of course, he only did abt 30 min worth of actual work & the rest of the time he was sitting in his van or going out to his van to retrieve something but i didnt see anything he brought back in. So, in the end, i ended up paying $236.00 for 30 min of work to caulk a smsall sink & toilet & spray paint the bottom of a mirror.. Even though they may have been a little high. i did agree to pay the $176.00 for an hour but i feel like i was taken advantage of because i am a woman or maybe its just the way they do business. i should get a refund of extra $60.00 because there was not even enough work to do to take up all that time. He used the time piddling & paddling along just trying to waste time so he could keep the clock running & get paid more. I'd like a refund & wont do business with you again or refer any friends or relatives until this is made right."
5,Installation went well and looks great.
5,"Friendly service man provided excellent service. He definitely knows what he is doing and got the job done right in an expeditious manner. I was also able to quickly and easily make an appointment over the telephone. This company will be first ""go to"" the next time I am in need of a household repair."
5,It went well. The door was fixed as well as the door knob. The door frame was also touched up with paint.
5,"This is the third time I have used Mr. Handyman and again we are very pleased with the service. Their technician, Butch, arrived on time and completed the job in less than an hour. Will definitely use them again."
5,the job went very smooth. the work was done in a timely fashion and very fair price. This is a job that I could not have gotten to due myself and I was glad Mr Handyman of Northern Balto County could assist with this project
5,I highly recommend this company. The technician did an excellent job on my rental property and was very professional. I will definitely call on them again in the future for my rental property.
5,"Technician arrived on time, friendly, completed all work from to do list in a timely manner. They went to Home Depot to get materials which was super convenient and saved me the trip and time, worth every dollar."
5,"Work completed as described, on time and within budget."
5,Everything went smoothly. Everyone was polite and professional.
5,Top notch service will definitely use service again
5,"Service was excellent and very professional. My floor is very uneven from a recent backflow valve installation and he was able to shim the new toilet perfectly. Would definitely hire again, great service and very reasonable price"
5,Loved the Handyman. Easy to schedule. He did a great job and was professional and helpful.
5,"Technician was awesome! Arrived on time, worked diligently while he saw there. Looks great. Great value, will definitely use them again"
1,Stated that they do not do so work only 29 minutes away from their office. Found this very curious response.
5,Very professional. Easy to schedule woth office staff. Great communication by all staff. Punctual. You get a quality job
5,They were very punctual and completed the job within allotted time with no issues.
5,"Light pole base had rusted away and lamp needed to be leveled and secured. Mr. Handyman's Technician, Butch, dug the surrounding area and leveled and secured the lamp with concrete mix. Job took less than 2 hrs and we are pleased with the result."
5,"Received an estimate via email. Office called to tell me Technician was en-route. Tech arrived on time, obtained materials and completed the job in a very professional manner. Finished product looks great. I will hire them again."
5,"It went great. The company is well run, I had specific instructions for when the job should start and they followed through with it. Excellent office staff. We have our hut that we put up each year at the end of the summer. For several years we were using Dick, from this company to put it up. Months before he was going to retire they sent out Don-along with Dick, at no extra charge to show him the ins and outs of putting up the hut. I thought this was going above and beyond. Yesterday Don showed up and did a nice job, he had a shoulder injury so the owner Mark came to help him out. They were both outstanding gentleman. I am very happy to recommend this great company!!"
5,"All the work was done very well and within the estimated time and costs. Both my wife and I are very pleased with the outcome of the work, and certainly would hire this company again for any future work."
5,"Well, will be back to repair fountain"
4,"It went very well. Rich, did a great job. Other than installing the installing the water lines backwards (hot water and cold water is on the wrong side), it went well. Unfortunately, it will cost me in order for them to come out to correct his error. Because it took longer than expected and we went over budget, we can't afford to pay them to correct this issue at this time. We will have to continue at a later date. I have recommended them to neighbors and friends. They are reputable company that will always show up. That's very rare these days."
5,Doug arrived when promised and quickly replaced what amounted to a broken water line. Total cost $164 for time and visit.
5,"I wasn't sure what was causing my baseboard to discolor and disintegrate - worried it was a pipe leak. Mr. Weis arrived on time; was very friendly/professional. diagnosed the issue quickly - ants were eating the molding! I was able to get rid of the ants behind the wall and he replaced the molding and caulking quickly, efficiently and professionally. My experience with Mr. Handyman was extremely pleasant - I highly recommend them."
5,"I had a pocket door that would not slide back into the wall. Rich took time to assess the issue and came up with a minimally invasive solution that maintained the integrity of these 100+ year old doors. The work was complete within 4 hours including removing trim, reapplying the door, putting the trim back, and repainting. Everything was cleaned upon completion. I am extremely pleased and would recommend Rich for special repairs on older homes."
5,"This is the second time I have used this company. My scores tell you pretty much everything. My only complaint is the cost, but they are responsive, prompt, professional, reliable, etc. They do good work. Some advice: I did save money by finding, purchasing and picking up the fan myself, because they would have charged for that."
5,"Very professional and work was of great quality. Definitely helped to clear up a good portion of our ever-growing chore list! The way they structure their rates, it is definitely worthwhile to compile a list of items and have them done all at the same time versus having them come out to complete a single task each time (the first hour of service is more expensive than each subsequent hour)."
5,Me Handyman did a great job fixing a disconnected dryer vent located behind my kitchen cabinet. The work was completed quickly I have not had any issues since. I would use their services again!
5,The technician arrived right on time and worked diligently while he was there. He was very efficient and did a great job! Would definitely use Mr. Handyman again!
5,Doug was a true professional. The quality of the work was excellent.
5,A very Customer service oriented company from scheduling to arriving on time. Technicians are professional and do a great job. I prefer to have licensed workers and guaranteed work.
1,"I purchased a gift certificate for a relative for $150.00. The individual from the company did perform the service. They were prompt. However, the ""minimum charge"" for an hour was $150.00. This was not disclosed upfront to the relative. When I called to express my concern about that the price for one hour of services (given the actual work took less than 20 minutes), the representative told me that this was my relative's ""error"" and actually used the expression ""buyer beware."" Wow. This was after interrupting me and telling me that I was telling them that the company wouldn't get paid because I'd purchased an Angie's List gift certificate. I actually purchased a gift certificate from them directly, so that entire portion of the conversation was irrelevant. Had the representative not interrupted me or had actually been listening, she wouldn't wasted my time going down a rabbit hole. Additionally, the representative mentioned that they decided to honor the certificate even though there was also a problem with the certificate number. The gift certificate came DIRECTLY FROM THEIR COMPANY. I got it from their website. If there were any issues with the number, those issues belong to Mr. Handyman. Up until this point, I had enormous confidence in the companies lately highly on Angie's List. That ended today."
5,"Butch arrived on time, examined the area, then he explained what he needed to do and answered my questions. He went about the job and finished fairly quickly. The area looks great and my husband is quite satisfied and so am I."
5,"I am VERY satisfied. This was worth every penny. Excellent work and professionalism. Thank you, Mr. Handyman (and Rich)!"
4,I believe he reinstalled them better than they were installed initially. They are very secure and have given me no trouble since.
5,very professional; repeat trip to accommodate neighbor
5,"Great! Provider worked in driving rain to make repairs to the corner of our house, and protect it from the elements."
5,"Wonderful! If only our insurance company had been as responsive as the handyman. They also hung our tv on the wall the same day they did the siding!! We will use for all future projects. Price noted included all materials, and he found matching siding for our old house!"
5,It went great. He is fast and polite.
5,"""Great Experience"" The gentlemen was on time--- he explained everything perfectly---very personable and professional. I will be using this company in the near future for other projects."
5,Jay did an excellent job as this was a complicated task. PVC Deck boards had to be pulled up so he could access the bottom of the window. Everything was put back together nicely. Trim was added that made it look better than the original.
5,Better experience than the handy app. No complaints at all!
4,Deck looks good. Only issue was the time needed to complete the job was really underestimated. The company did provide some compensation.
5,They cleaned it out and all is working well.
5,"Better than anticipated. From scheduling with Lynn to having Wade perform the work, we couldn't be more pleased. Well worth the price. Everyone was sincere, professional and easy to work with."
5,"I forget exactly what we had done aside from some drywall repairs for minor water damage, but our handyman was excellent, seams were invisible. He also noticed some worn corners in a few hallways and fixed them up so they're nice and square again. Would not hesitate to call them again."
5,Excellent. From the initial call to set everything up to the technician finishing the job was a great experience. Will definitely be using them again.
5,"I called the company and the young lady was very helpful. She explained the service that could be done, how much it approximately would be, and worked very hard to get a service person out as soon as possible. When there was a cancellation, she called with a possible earlier appointment. Very good customer service. Don arrived early and was ready to work. He was very pleasant and listened to my desires. He was very professional. I was very comfortable with his knowledge and ability to get the job done. He completed one job and went right into the next. I would definitely use this company and its service again."
5,"Mr. Handyman and specifically Jerimiah, couldn't have been more professional or done a better job. We are completely satisfied."
4,"Mr. Handyman (Dick) arrived about 10 minutes late, which wasn't a problem. He was very professional and polite. My issue isn't with the services provided, but the estimate and perhaps the type of work (not the handyman's fault, but the saleswoman). The cost is $154 the first hour and $104 each additional hour (in 15 minute segments). I provided photos of the workspace as well as measurements. I stated there were 6 large sections and two smaller sections, but the handy did not receive the correct work statement before arriving. The salesman estimated the work (based on measurements and photos) to take 3-4 hours. It took over 5 hours and that was with my husband helping and us doing some of the clean-up afterwards. Materials provided cost $140, so the total for labor and materials came out to $710. It was about twice what I expected to pay to have the work done. I thought the work would include a tracked screen system or something, but it was cut and stapled screen and the trim, when replaced, hid the seems and work. That's not the handyman's fault either, and I should have requested something specific if I wanted it. We also have to patch all the nail holes now, and do the touch-up paint job. The end result was a very nice-looking screen, but at an exorbitant price for a less-than-polished final product."
5,"The cost depends on how long it is going to take. They have been good at responsiveness. They have been on time. They are very professional. They came out very quickly after I called, looked it over, and gave me some ideas of what they were going to do. Two people came out and they are very nice, friendly, and know what they are doing."
5,"He was punctual and professional. All work was very well done. He cleaned up all project work. He was personable and expert. The one thing i would have changed would have been to identify ahead of time exactly what items he might have needed, as he had to go out to get some things which i did not have on hand."
5,"Our handyman, Jeremiah I believe, was great. Very knowledgeable, capable, and a nice guy too."
5,"The stuff seems to have gotten done. They're really quick. They had to reschedule sometimes, but I don't think that's the same as being late. One of the things that stood out is that they have the appropriate license for the work that they are doing. Because prior to using them, I had used some people that I had gotten through a different set of recommendations, not through Angie's List, and that particular provider wandered off with a fair chunk of cash not doing the work that they were supposed to have done. That's sort of why Angie's List is so important."
5,"I would use again in a heart beat. The price was reasonable, and work was done much more quickly than I expected. Also, I appreciated that my house was left very clean after substantial dust was created."
5,"It went great. Mark was very professional on the phone. He was able to send one of his workers out a day or two later to look at the jobs and provide an estimate. His price was as good as or a little cheaper than a couple other estimates I got. The shed floor turned out great. Regarding the drywall, they went to the trouble of waiting for the spackle to dry, and came back the next day to sand it. Per my instructions they left it like that for me to paint. When I applied the primer, some of the spackle in one area came off. I explained the problem to Mark. He said he never heard of this type of thing happening. He sent someone over who redid the spackle, and even applied primer to the redone area, all at no extra charge. I was then able to paint with no problem."
5,Very professional and on time. Very good!
5,"The price was pretty good. It was very urgent and I inquired from a bunch of companies who didn't have time. They were able to send out a guy rather quickly and got the work done. The settlement happened on time so they were very good. When you call them up, they give you a time slot rather quickly and the quality of the work was good. The work passed the inspection. I think for the small job that I hired them to do, they were very good."
5,Well pleased he got the job done in good time. Very courteous.
5,"Great Job! Well pleased>Tech Don was courteous,went right to work and cleaned up afterwards.Very efficient!"
5,Well! ...came on time...removed door...took it to shop..fixed
5,Wade was on time and so professional very pleased with all the work he did. Lynn was also very helpful and patient with all my questions!
1,"If you have a smaller project or projects don't waste your time calling. They asked what types of things I needed done. I provided an exhaustive list of small projects as examples but said they didn't all need to be done at once and I was most concerned about getting 3-4 outside things done before it got cold. He asked what the prior people who failed to show up to complete a job charged and when I told him he replied ""You don't want me because we charge way more than that"" I told him my primary concern was getting a professional who could do the job properly and show up when they said they would. He spent the entire time on the phone trying to talk me out of hiring them because of their price and then finally reluctantly offered me a full day for $818 over a month away."
5,"Wade was a true pleasure to have in our house, the exact kind of person you have complete trust in and feel comfortable leaving in your house. He showed up on time and ready to work. The first task was hanging a complicated crystal chandelier with a lot of crystals. My kids were so excited that they monitored everything he did. I really appreciated how professionally and kindly he dealt with them, and when appropriate he even let them help. My wife was equally impressed. Wade did all of the tasks professionally and efficiently. We could not have been more pleased. If you are thinking of hiring a handyman, do yourself a favor and ask for Wade."
5,"Excellent! No other way to describe it. On time, quality work, the controlled mess was cleaned up, and a reasonable price. I had two holes in my ceiling from a leak above me. Jeremiah, I'll call him the artist, cut to the drywall to the odd shape of one of the holes. I was a bit apprehensive about hiring someone on an hourly bases. I was thinking the job would be needlessly prolonged, but it wasn't. I was very, very happy. Jeremiah was friendly and very professional. I will definitely call them again. I'm an ex-Realtor so have worked with many contractors over the years. These guys are one of the best. The job took close to 5hrs."
1,When I contacted them to tell them the delivery date I was told it would be 7 days before they could get someone to come out to install the door. I explained to them I has no where to store the door for 7 day since it's pre-hung with sidelites. The didn't seem to care the least. I wont do business with them again. Not to mention they charged me $146.00 just to do the measuring and that was suppose to be applied to the cost for installing the door.
5,"Painless. Absolutely painless. Prompt, courteous and efficient"
5,"He was running a little late, arrived 45 minutes past the 2 hour window but did call to let me know. Did services very efficiently."
5,Mr. White has done work in my home before. He does a very good job.
5,"I was impressed with the provider from the first phone call. Alan knew right away that they could help, anticipated my questions about insurance and rates before I could even ask, and explained the limitations of service upfront. On the day of service, Dick was on time, friendly, and VERY knowledgeable of what needed to be done. He knew what caulking needed to be totally replaced, and what ones just needed spot fixes- all done appropriately. He worked efficiently, and his work was much better than my husband or I could have done. I will definitely be calling them again for other jobs."
5,"I originally submitted an online inquiry on the provider's website but hadn't heard back after 2 or 3 weeks. Because of the reviews here I decided to give Mr. Handyman another shot and called directly. The person who answered (I'm terrible with names) was very apologetic about the online inquiry issue. I explained what I needed (I only had a rough idea since there were so many little odd jobs like hanging a few pictures, switching out some light bulbs, tightening some fixtures etc...) and I was told exactly what they did and did not provide (turns out almost everything I needed they could do except deal with a minor plumbing issue). The person on the phone was knowledgeable about the services, answered all of my questions and did not simply punt my technical questions to the tech who would be coming. I was able to get an appointment for the next morning and was given a 2 hour time window. I got a 15 minute call ahead and the tech arrived on time as promised. We walked through the house and I explained everything I needed. He got to work right away, was extremely professional and friendly, and was accommodating when I added a few small things in the middle of the job that I had forgotten when we did the walk through. He was also able to answer questions about other services the company provides while he was working (I asked if they do furniture assembly and if he could haul away a few pieces of furniture he was disassembling). One stand out for me was that I was sure I would need to replace a screen door because my dog ran through it and I just needed to know what to order or have Mr. Handyman order and install it, but instead of going to the expense the tech said he could repair it (which he did) at the appointment. The hourly rate and the fee for the hauling I found to be extremely reasonable for the overall professionalism and quality of the work. The tech worked very efficiently. I would definitely use this company again once I have a few things piled up on my list (the flat fee of $146 for the first hour seems a little steep if you only have one small thing that needs to be done)."
5,"Initial Contact made via this site and prompt return call. Scheduling went well and they truly worked with me to fit into my day. Wade was on time, assessed the jobs to be done and went about them efficiently and thoroughly. I will definitely use them in the future."
5,"great. first time I had used them and was starting small. will be making a bigger list now to use again. pleasant, professional - very happy."
5,"Ken called to let me know when to expect Don. He arrived right on time, reviewed everything that needed to be done.(I added some things. originally it was to just hang the TV) Then Don got right to work. Neat, clean, efficient and personable We couldn't be more pleased. Will definitely call again and recommend others!"
5,no drama. all went very well
5,"We were very pleased. I called Monday morning and scheduled the visit for Tuesday. After discussing whether they could paint the wood (the trim was on the second level of our house, Ken moved it back a day to give us time to get the paint. Scheduling was very easy and professional. Handyman did arrive on the date scheduled. I had left the office a message that I would be in a training all day and to call my wife if any issues. They actually listened to the message and called her to give her an update. The repair work looks great. They confirmed when they were done and sent us the receipt by tomorrow morning. We would definitely use them again. The only hiccup we encountered is that we were told we didn't have to be home to have the work done, so neither of us took off of work. However, they didn't tell us that they would need access to electricity until they called that morning when they realized it was a problem. Thankfully our neighbor let them use theirs, but a heads up about that would have been good."
5,"The handyman arrived promptly and tackled the varied task list without any issues. He let me know when we needed a specialist (window repairs) and handled the rest in good time. The rates are a tad pricy, but the service was worth it for the short timeframe in which I needed to have the work done."
5,Came same day. Great communication from dispatch. Worked quickly and did a fine job for reasonable price.
5,"I've had this company do work for me twice in the past year and the people who have come have been very capable, professional, friendly and willing to do even the simplest tasks. They've also been honest in telling me when a task is not one they can do, which I appreciate."
5,"It went very well. I was called a half hour before they came just to give me a heads up. The gentleman was very courteous, quiet, just came in and did the work I asked. He was really efficient. And they man who answers the phone when you call to schwdule(Allen) also called back after the work was done to make sure everything went well and I was okay with all the work the handyman completed. The whole process was wonderful. From scheduling, they were very polite, and accommodating to my scheduling needs."
5,"Can't say enough good about them. Fast, efficient, and extremely high quality. You might find others that will cut corners and come in slightly cheaper, but you'll pay more in the long run because the quality will likely not be as good."
5,"Dick, our handyman, was on point. I told him the issues and he got right to work. He fixed all issues we had. He explained everything he did and gave me advice for maintaining the door. I only wish I had more for him. I'll be creating that list and contacting Mr. Handyman again. They also followed up with a phone call to make sure service went well."
5,"They were prompt, courteous, professional and completed the job as well as expected."
5,Overall they did a good job and were at the home for around an hour.
5,"Don came out and diagnosed the problem as some light mold in spots and blistering paint in multiple other spots ( an 8 X 11 foot area). He went out to purchase some materials to fix my problem. When he returned, he taped plastic to all of the walls, in the area he would be working. Put down drop cloths to cover the furniture and carpet. He sprayed the mold with a mold control product after scraping off the mold and blisters. He examined the ceiling for soft spots and weaknesses that could cause problems later (he found none). He plastered the spots that appeared uneven after he finished scraping. Since the plaster was going to take a while to dry. He asked if I wanted to sand the plaster or have him come back and do it. I chose to have him come back. He cleaned up all the protective gear he used. On his return, he repeated protecting the furniture and carpet with plastic. He sanded down any uneven spots and cleaned up after himself. He told me to get ""Kiltz"" primer to prevent any repeat of the mold showing up again. And to go into the attic and spray any visible signs of mold with a Mold Control product to kill any activity there. Don is personable and a fountain of very useful information that he shared freely. When I asked what else his company did, he gave me a flier stating all there service categories by room. Will I use him again? You bet your A**!!"
5,"I have been very pleased with them and I used them twice. The first time the gentleman was here the whole day. He came in at 8 and left at 5 o’clock and it was almost a $1000. But he addressed all the issues that I originally had him come in for. He fixed the leaky faucets in the bathroom, he fixed loose stair barristers, we needed some grouting in one of the showers, he fixed some light fixtures and lot of little odds and ends. They were very punctual and utilized their time really well. I was afraid of paying somebody on an hourly rate for work but these gentlemen were very good. There was never a down time. You never felt like that he was sitting around talking on his phone and he was really not working. I was at home the whole time and following them around."
5,It went very well. I only wish the rate was better. The service though was very good.
5,They were absolutely terrific. The guy was thorough and did a great job washing the house. They were also timely and pleasant.
3,It went well. There are just extra costs that I am unhappy.
5,He is very expensive but he is a very reliable provider on the list.
5,My husband and I were amazed at how quickly the work was completed and the quality of work. Very professional. We will definitely call Mr. Handyman the next time we need work done around the house.
5,"They did a really good job. They were a little pricey, but I am very happy with the service that I got."
5,"I was impressed by the fact that Jeremiah didn't only replace the drywall tape but explained to me his concerns before thoroughly investigated why it was peeling off. He did such a great job of re-taping the area and spackling it that it doesn't need to be painted. The patch he did where he removed the smoke detector is almost invisible even before it is painted. He also took great care in getting rid of the rusted nails in the mortar without damaging the brick and, after inspecting my storm door, explained why it was hard to open at times. Jeremiah knows his trade, was very pleasant to work with and did a great job cleaning up as he went along."
2,First on their website they quoted a free estimate he got to the job he told me everything that I've told him on the phone about the sump pump then he had to go to Home Depot to get it and I didn't realize that I was being charged for that time. They charge $146 to come out and $96 every 15 minutes which was not told to me until I got ready to pay for it then I'll call their office and the person that answered the phone said said if I wanted a cheapest service I should've called someone else I did tell him that I had called BGE home and they quoted me $90 per hour to come out and I thought that they would be cheaper
5,"Superior service, knowledgable tech, They got the Job done fast and the work was perfect. Will use again"
5,"I called to make an appointment, was treated politely and quoted the hourly rate. Owner assessed my job and accurately stated it should take no more than a 1/2 hour which it did exactly. He stated the cost for the job and then we agreed on a date. I did not have to wait a long time for the appointment date to be made. The old wireless doorbell box was removed requiring screw drivers etc and new one put in it's place. Battery operated so new batteries installed. Chime level and music was set then the box was covered (actually the trickiest part.) Then new doorbell push button installed on outside door frame . Required screwing in screws and then attaching cover. Mr. Handyman was due between 10-12 AM and was at my doorstep exactly at 10. He was very polite and personable, answered all of my questions and offered some information about changing the push button battery. Would definitely use this company again."
5,"The cuts were clean, the doors swing perfectly and no damage of any kind was done. They were very punctual and responsive."
5,"I have used Mr. Handyman of Northern Baltimore County for years on a wide variety of jobs- indoor and outdoor, large and small. They do excellent work for a reasonable charge and respond quickly when called. The owner, Ken Dunn, is accessible and fair. The handymen are very skilled, polite and efficient. I am very satisfied with their work and will use them again in the future for big and small jobs."
5,They showed up on time. They fixed everything in a timely fashion. I'd definitely use this company again.
5,They're great. I spent about $134. Everything that they did I liked. We had a book shelf that didn't have a back to it and he put a back on it and he installed a couple overhead ceiling fans and he also put in a sump pump.
5,The repairman was on time. He quickly assessed the requirements of the the situation and was very efficient. It was my first time using Angie's List to find a repairman. It was an excellent experience!
5,"He arrived on time. After I explained what was required, he went right to work and methodically completed all the tasks and the final outcomes all were excellent. He was very pleasant and great conversationalist as well. I was 100% pleased with the experience and definitely will call Mr. Handyman again when I have repairs or improvements that are needed."
5,Work was performed on time and at the price quoted. Area was cleaned when work was completed and to satisfaction.
5,"My experience with them is good. They were professional, friendly and knowledgeable."
2,"The call center took down all my information including a description of the work I needed, which was drywall repair/replacement and laminate flooring installation. The local rep called me back and said they don't do that work, when in fact, that work is listed on their website of services provided. Guess they just don't want my money."
5,"Very professional. Jeremiah was on time, very competent and both pleasant and polite. Very well done. I would definitely use them again."
5,"Jeremiah arrived 15 mins early. We went over the items on the To Do list and he had helpful suggestions regarding an outside tap and the electrical outlet. He quickly cleaned out the gutters before going to purchase additional materials. This took a little longer than anticipated as he had been unable to find the materials he is accustomed to using and had to make another stop and search a bit for a suitable alternative. He had receipts for everything and gave me the option of using the materials he had selected, or not. As it happened, they were all perfectly suitable; he had given consideration to his selections. He moved through the tasks quickly and efficiently and explained everything as he went along. I left him to finish the work and before I got home he had already finished and called me with an update on his time and the total cost. Everything looked good when I got back."
5,"He was on time and was work was very neat and clean. However after he left I did discover one picture that he forgot to hang in my office. Maybe I should have turned it around and pulled it out so he would've remembered. He caulked my basement bathroom entry, hung mirros, my awards, curtain rods, changed the light bulb on my back porch and he mounted the hose reel to my house. I scheduled him for two hours. He's very professional."
3,"Weather played a major issue in the completion of this job, however the first day I was scheduled for work they cancelled on me an hour before. The overall quality of the work was not the quality I would have expected from what I paid. I ended up having to touch up the paint myself. In part this was due to the fact that I was not there to supervise myself. They never came at the time we had set up, either arriving early or changing at the last minute to not coming due to weather. This made me feel less than comfortable considering I was paying by the hour. There was also much confusion as to what I actually wanted done which is in part due to the fact that even though I took off work on three separate occasions, I was never able to actually meet the person doing the work. While I was offered a small discount for the inconvenience I will not be using this company again."
5,"Mr Handyman went fine. The job went well. They came when they said, then they did a good job."
5,"Late Thursday I needed a rental unit fixed up on Memorial Day weekend. I fortunately had signed up for Angie List and had used them in past with great results. Well, Mr Handyman owner, Alan, could not have been nicer. He had a man at my place Saturday at 9am and the work was completed in 2 hours. Paid via credit card and reciept emailed to me. Thanks."
5,Very pleased. Excellent job from scheduling to clean up!
5,"Scheduling an appointment via telephone was easy, and I received email and telephone confirmations. Jeremiah arrived on time, was very friendly and professional, and performed an excellent job. Would highly recommend and will use their services again."
5,"Scheduling the appointment was easy. Don, the technician came on time and did the work promised and later added, efficiently. Spent a total of 3 hrs 15 mts. He was very professional and advised on a couple other items as well."
5,I called on Thursday 5/15 at noon and I was able to set an appointment the next day at 8:00AM! I was very surprised at how quick I was able to get the job scheduled. Contractor arrived on time in uniform with company truck. I explained the job of removing attic stairs and installing new stairs. I had bought a set of stairs that was too small but he was able to frame it in and make it work. All in all the job took a little under four hours. The stairs he installed worked perfectly. The finishing work (i.e. trim and plaster to cover holes) was good but not exceptional. I would highly recommend this company and I would use them again.
5,"Great service, excellent work, wonderful responsiveness."
4,Several different workers. There was a variance of work quality.
5,Jeremiah arrived on the job early and was ready to work. I walked him through all the projects and then we talked about pricing. He was very skilled and all the work was completed looks great. This company is expensive but I think you get what you pay for.
5,"Excellent job. Looks like they have been there all along. Very professional and courteous. Doug called us in for any style, placement decision. Other than that, he knew just what to do and how to do it. We're delighted. Okay, what I really mean, is my wife is very happy, which makes me happy."
5,"Our technician was Jeremiah who arrived at the scheduled time. He was very personable, efficient and skillful person. Several years ago, we had contacted a handyman and wanted several of the things on the above list done. Much to our chagrin he didn't have the skill needed nor the patience to complete several of the tasks. However, he did complete one of the projects we had contracted for him to do. We were a little leery of getting another handyman, however, we joined Angies list and saw the reviews on Mr. Handyman and decided to go win him. Needles to say, we were not disappointed. We will definitely use this company again and would not hesitate to recommend him to others."
5,"They did not keep me waiting. The person who answered the phone was able to schedule me right away - the same day. The technical arrived within the window they gave me. Also, they called just to let me know they were on the way. Both the person who answered the phone and the technican were very attentitive to my needs and were always very professional and courteous. I have never had to pay for more that the first hours. They are not the kind of company that works slow so they can charge you more. I would happily use them again."
5,Very well --- was very pleased.
5,I was very impressed with the professionalism of Allan and the quick response. They were able to do the job on the same day called. The work was done neatly and everything was cleaned up before he left. He did not leave until I reviewed what he had done.. I would use them again. Great job!
5,"prompt, courteous and professional worker arrived at the time agreed, got to work immediately and wored steadily until it was finished. I have used Mr. Handyman in the past and I particularly appreciate such reliable service. All of the tasks are things I could DIY, but it would have taken me twice as long and I am just tired from moving, unpacking and decorating my new home. Selling the previous home was a whole lot of work, too, and after a while, you just get tired and impatient to be finished. I was able to do other things while he took care of my ""Honey-Do List"" and now my husand won't have to spend his precious weekend on it, either. Mr. Handyman does not disappoint. It is pricey, but I am trained as an accountant, and you just have to pay for this kind of service or they won't be there when you need them again."
5,"He was terrific - he did everything very well, needed no instruction or guidance, just the list, and was highly professional. I've used him twice now, and plan to use him again."
5,"He touched up the painting, fixed the exterior shutters, and fixed exterior caulking. I was very satisfied by his work."
5,"Good job. Clean and neat, that was appreciated."
5,"This is the second time I called Mr. Handyman. J is honest, hardworking and does great work. I was pleased both times I used Mr. Handyman and would use them again for sure. They are a little pricey but the quality of their work is worth the cost."
5,"Their first appointment was interrupted by a major storm, but we rescheduled. Their earlier appointment ran late, so they called to let me know, then confirmed that the technician was buying the materials. He came then the owner came to assist. Then they realized that they needed more materials, so the owner went to get them. The job was much more than we expected because the water damage was more extensive, but they got it done. Remaining work to be done by the homeowner is more plaster, sanding and painting."
5,It was excellent. They came on very short notice when I needed them.
5,"Quality work, timely. Made sure I was satisfied with the result and very professional."
5,I would have liked have liked a price to be set before he came. I thought the price was a little high but he did a good job. This is the second handyman I have had who has not given me the pricing before and I will not be doing that again.
5,I called and explained what I needed. They were very responsive and had someone out that da. They took about the time that they quoted for the service maybe a little less. I was very pleased with work.
5,"From the first call in to Ken to the completion of my list of jobs, I was extremely pleased with the work and the service Mr. Handyman provided. The service technician ( I think his name was Doug) was so professional , pleasant and very, very competent. He did an amazing job hanging a very heavy 3 piece mirror that had to be exact in the measurement. He even was able to give me good advice on where on the wall to hang it. It looks beautiful and I am delighted. I had called another Handyman from the norhtwest Baltimore area who is also on Angie's List and they could not figure out how to hang the mirror and came up with a ridiculous plan for tearing out my drywall to do the task. Needless to say, I sent them away (but had to pay them anyway!). So when I called Mr. Handman I was a bit discouraged. But I cannot say enough about the process and wonderful work Mr. Handyman did in my home. I would not hesitate to call them again for any job."
5,"Jeremiah worked efficiently and effectively completed all the tasks we determined could be completed. Overall, I was very pleased with my experience with Mr. Handyman."
5,"Arrived early (which is fine with me), came and surveyed the job and went to get the exhaust fan. He came back promptly and while working pointed out some issues that should be addressed in the future. He found that the fan he bought was too small so he told me he had to go back to get another one but he would be off the clock. Came back and finished the installation quickly and professionally. It was a little expensive but worth it and would use them again."
5,"He was very timely, professional and friendly."
5,All the work with done quickly and very professionally. There were some tasks on my list that were out of the scope of their services and they recommended that I conatct a specialist in those cases; I really appreciated that advice. Just another sign of their professionalism. I would call them again in the future and highly recommend them.
5,"Jeremiah arrived precisely on time. He was knowledgeable and efficient. He understood exactly what we were looking for, and completed all tasks thoroughly. Everything continues to work well, too - always a good sign! We are very pleased with the level of service and professionalism and will definitely use Mr. Handyman again."
1,"Well, he was super nice and seemed to know what he was doing. But, the toilet still runs and the door knob came off in my hand today. So, the $150 or so that I spent on Mr. Handyman was a waste. The two problems that were to have been fixed persist. I called them today to tell them what happened and they said they could come out again. When I explained that it seemed a bit unfair to pay again for the same job, they told me the clock starts at $0 and I pay for the time. So, I said thank you but no thank you. I would call another company. I am out the $ but I don't want to be out even more $ to have someone fix something that doesn't stay fixed. It wasn't as though the repair person told me the jobs were not fixable, But, he gave me the bill, I paid it, and these two pretty simple jobs remain unfixed. I did give them a chance to rectify the situation (one free hour of work would have been called for, right?). I work and I stayed home for the fix the first time; now I would have to stay home again. It was a waste of time and money. I am going to call someone else."
5,"Excellent service. Called this am & Jeremiah, carpenter, came out w/in 2 hrs of call. He was clean, wore company shirt & drove company truck. He evaluated problem, gave me relevant information to make decision for repair. Removed decaying wood, went to store & purchased required materials, fixed fascia sections. He kept me informed for each step as needed. He carried own tools & c,earned up area afterwards. Am very pleased & requested estimate for two additional jobs. Hourly rate can be more expensive than maybe total cost of a ""job"" but am happy to know I can get handy man service since I don't know how to do any repairs myself & it's always been hard to get someone to come out for small jobs."
5,"I rely on Mr. Handyman to maintain five properties. As a part-time landlord with a regular full-time job, I need a trustworthy and competent agent to handle the problems as they pop up. Mr. Handyman has been able to fix, install, repair and replace any problem that has come up, including replacing doors, window screens, downspouts, caulking, laying floors, faucets, leaks, exhaust fans, painting, cabinets, et cetera. My tenants like the professionalism of the handymen and the trademark red van."
5,"Jeremiah arrived on time (actually a few minutes early), took the time to find out exactly what needed to be done, and verified that I had all the necessary materials ready. He worked very meticulously all day, without taking a break. The quality of his work was excellent, and I am pretty picky about details. This company is not cheap by any means, I had been quoted less expensive fees by others, but Mr. Handyman was able to get me scheduled pretty quickly. After experiencing the quality of the work, I would have no problem hiring them again as my first choice."
5,Outstanding job - my tenant made it a point to call me afterwards and describe how great the repair looked. Certainly using these guys again for future repairs!
4,"He did very well. He was on time, cleaned up after himself. I thought the price was very reasonable from all of the quotes that we had received. And almost after a year, the wall still looks very nice."
4,He was very mechanical minded and had no problems with the chair carrier. He wasn't quite as adapt or expereinced with the curtain rod and had to patch up a few mistakes.
5,"I called the company late in the morning. They said they could send someone by the afternoon, which was great because it was the first cold day and the window was just propped near its opening. The handyman, named Dick, arrived within the hour!!!! And proceeded to quickly fix the window, which is oversized and really heavy, quickly and quietly. Since we had about a half an hour of time left (they have an hourly rate plus materials), he was kind enough to hang two heavy plaster medallions and give two estimates on future projects. I feel very fortunate to have found this company and this wonderful, professional and capable workman. Thank you Angie!!!! I will use them again and again."
4,"Work went well. Handyman arrived on time, was able to replace showerhead without cutting into wall but we had asked to replace the handle/tap that controls the water. That required cutting into the wall and replacing the valve along with the handle. The work was done, clean up was good and he replaced the drywall that he had to cut. Good clean up too. A few weeks later we noticed water marks on the ceiling of the kitchen, below the bathroom. Sure enough, we had a leak at the valve that had been replaced. Handyman was prompt in the response, opening the wall again, fixing the faulty valve, returning a week later to make sure all was okay before closing the wall again. They even took care of the celling in the kitchen.. The leak was not large so there wasn't much to take care of. While I was happy with the service, I am not sure where the fault lies for the leak.... was it faulty equipment or work? I don't know. We will use Handyman again. We like the service, the response and the convenience. Not sure if we will use them for plumbing again."
5,It went splendid. I was so happy with the work the provider. I would recommend them to anyone who wants this type of work done.
5,"Jeremiah was a very polite ,courteous, professional, worker. Would definately recommment company"
5,"Jeremiah was courteous, knowledgeable, efficient, professional, and 10 minutes early. Great worker."
5,"Jeremiah was great. He was tidy, quiet and on time. For the sake of my pocket I wish he had been quicker but his work was superior. I will certainly ask for him again if I find anything else that needs doing!"
5,"It went great. Jeremiah explained all the problems, costs and time it would take up front. He asked if I was o.k. with it and he did a great job on the repair."
5,"It went extremely well. The employee was on time, announced the start and completion of each task, clean up after each task and treated the property with the up most care. I will definitely use them again."
5,They showed up on time and were very professional. They did a great job.
2,"I hired Alan Deitch's Handyman company to better affix the front shutters to my Baltimore rowhome. The shutters were already installed, but I wanted two additional screws and holes drilled to affix the centers of the sides to ensure they would not bow with extreme heat or inclement weather. To drill 10 holes in my formstone and insert 10 plastic screws, it allegedly took nearly 3 hours. I have 3 pairs of shutters. They were already up. It took my contractor less than 2 hours to install them originally. There is absolutely no way it took this handyman 3 hours for this work, or the handyman was incredibly inept. I paid $316 for 10 holes to be drilled into my formstone. Thankfully, they were drilled well. I was taken to the cleaners."
5,"I made an inquiry with the provider. Although, I did not use his services, he returned my call promptly and professionally."
4,Very nice contractors. Are always able to come even on short notice. Very honest and professional. Nice to work with
5,It went well. I had a ton of contractors in the house that day and he even helped the electricians by holding some stuff for them while they were also maneuvering under the kitchen sink. Easy to schedule. Called the week prior for Monday service. Hired them for additional work.
5,"Jerimiah, the service technician, arrived on time. He was very courteous and professional. All work scheduled plus an extra job (dryer duct cleaning) was completed in a timely manner. Jerimaih wore shoe covers whenever he was working in the house and did an excellent job cleaning up when he was finished. I scheduled a power washing for my home for a later date. A company representative called shortly after Jerimiah left to ensure that all work was done to my satisfaction. Overall an excellent experience. I will use Mr. Handyman of N. Baltimore County for any other home repairs/upgrades."
5,Jeremiah did an excellent job of caulking the windows of our home. He also cleaned our skylight and straightened our lamp post.
5,"I called to make the appointment and spoke to someone at the answering service. I then received a confirmation call from the company. They were willing to work around my schedule, which I greatly appreciated. I made the appointment 3 days prior to needing services. Bob was very nice. He was efficient and did a beautiful job with this work. For what he did, and considering that we purchased the materials, I thought the price was high. If we had other things for him to do to fill the time, I think the cost would have been more reasonable, but for this, it was too much."
5,"Jeremiah arrived on time, worked efficiently and was very professional. I am very satisfied with his work. He also did a great job two weeks ago when he replaced rotted wood around windows, replaced the post which holds up the porch and caulked/painted the trim and post. Everything looks great! I have used Mr. Handyman of Northern Baltimore County for various projects in past years and have always found them to be very reliable and professional. Quality of work is very good."
5,He painted over a gold wall for me when I was moving out of my apartment. He did an excellent job and I will use him again.
5,"Everything went well. The technician was not the owner, but was friendly and professional. I would use them again."
5,"Jeremiah was punctual and well prepared. He completed the jobs promptly and was very competent. I appreciated being able to get such quick turn around. Called them last Thursday, they had someone here thee days later."
4,"Great communication, good work, did what he said he would do"
3,"I thought that Mr Handyman of Northern Baltimore County was very expensive and they have workers that join and leave the company. Sometimes I have work done okay, sometimes I have them as tacky so I'm very, very reluctant to use the company. They're very quick to respond and I like that, it's just the level of work that you get is not consistent. The price is very expensive. I will probably not use them again."
5,It went excellent. I just left the garage door open and he started to work on it. I would recommend his services to others.
5,"The work was done very well, very quickly, and Alan was exceptional about communicating schedule, price, and progress. The price was slightly higher than another estimate I got, but Alan's professionalism was worth the difference. Would definitely use them again."
5,"Dick showed up at 8:00 in the dot. I showed him what needed doing, we discussed it a little bit and he got to work. When it came to the damp, crumbly wall behind the tiles in the shower, I was disturbed by what was there and concerned that this would entail way beyond what I was expecting. Dick was able to use some quick setting cement and build a ""wall"" to which he was able to attach the old tile. The wall looks great - all the tiles are back in line and in their proper alignment once again. One of the reasons I will use Handyman of Baltimore County again, aside from the quality of work, is the ability to have someone come out on relatively short notice. I called on Monday, expecting it would be a couple of weeks before someone would be able to come do the work, and Ken told me someone could be there Wednesday morning. From what Ken and Dick both told me, this is the norm for them. I appreciated that the estimate for the amount of time needed to complete the work was right on target, despite the bathroom wall needing more attention and work than originally thought and a minor snag with one of the ceiling fans."
5,"They were always prompt, efficient, knowledgeable, and more than willing to offer a less expensive solution. Had I not moved away from the area, I'd still be calling them regularly."
4,"It went well. The basic work was done very well. The only regret that I had was that I was communicating with service person from work. He was great sending pictures by phone to help me choose what I wanted, but when he asked about finishing off the handrails, I didn't fully understand what he meant., It ended up taking him at least an hour longer (thus, cost me more). If I had seen and realized what he was doing, I would have passed on ""finishing it so it looked real nice"". I think that this was my fault for not being home when the work was being performed. And I do intend to use them again for future projects."
5,"My window had received a lot of damage due to multiple massive storms. There was such a huge gap between the upper facia board above the window and the exterior of the house, that water would continually rush in. Since this was a large area that had water damage, the provider assured me that they would be able to at least start work on the area the day they were scheduled to show up. There was initial confusion about scheduling, but the owner gave me multiple choices that worked with my schedule and we were finally able to come up with a great solution. Once the provider arrived, the service tech looked at the problem, and started work right away. He told me that if anything additional needed to be done, they could get the materials that day, and hopefully finish in a few hours. Originally, the estimated that the entire day would be utilized for the work. He was able to assess additional areas tht I had suspected had succumed to water damage, but he noted that their integrity was ok, and didn't need to be replaced. I had others look at the same area (my wood floor) and told me that they would have to rip it all up, and replace it, even though there was no visable damage. It was reassuring to know that I was getting an honest oponion and that replacing the floor was only cosmetic, and not needed. The service tech was able to complete the work in only a few hours, and used ""quick dry"" materials around my window because we were supposed to get a huge storm, and he wanted to make sure that it dried in time. Additionally, he painted the trim around the areas to top it all off! I was so pleased with the work, that I asked him to check out a few other areas and received some suggestions. I've already called them up to schedule anotehr appointment. I saved so much money and time with them, that I will always have them on call."
5,"Super puntual, pleasant, works with you. I had a misunderstanding from the office. Didn't realize the customer has to specify if windows need cleaning both in & out. Plus customer needs to provide cleaner for inside. No problem for Mr handyman. He sailed out, purchased the necessary cleaners (of course we reimbursed him) and got the job done. The windows sparkle (husband said it's too bright inside house ;>) Dirty awning is lovely again. Doesn't spoil your appetite when eating under it. Green algae is gone from white siding. Looks like new. Super10 rating from this family! We'll certainly call on Mr. Handyman again. Gail Frantz"
4,"on time professional had to assemble and adjust the surround to fit fireplace and uneven walls discovered a gape in the fireplace that went to the outside filled the hole on the inside and went outside and filled all holes found. it was expensive because of the time it took to complete, but I wanted it done right and I am pleased."
5,"I spoke directly to the owner on the phone and he was courteous and friendly and got me scheduled for the handyman to come within 3 days. He also explained the pricing and recommended I buy my own supplies to save myself some money. The handyman that came confirmed that that saved me a lot of money. I got a call the morning the handyman was scheduled to come saying that he would be a few minutes late because of traffic. He showed up perhaps 15 minutes late, not a problem at all, and got right to work. He finished within about 3 1/2 hours, slightly longer than I thought it would take, but the work was very good. This company charges by the hour or fraction thereof, something I especially appreciate since I didn't want to have to pay for a full 4th hour when he only worked a portion of it. Overall, I think this company is slightly pricey, but the work was solid and they are punctual, responsible, and courteous--very important things in my book. I would definitely contact them again."
4,Very well. The young carpenter did all the work. He had to go to Lowes/Home Depot for the replacement wood and stain. (I had purchased the light fixtures.) He charged me for the materials and minimal extra time. I was very satisfied with all the tasks.
5,"Mr. handyman was late about one half hour on the 1st day. Other than that one time, punctuality was good. He promised to call me each day after he finished his work, but I never got a call. Those with only problems. The work done was quality work and I'm quite pleased with the result. I can now enter my home through the front door with my power chair. In my home is more secure new deadbolts, in front and back. My refrigerator is making ice. I like the work so much that I asked Mr. handyman to look at some of the jobs that need to be done around the house and in the yard."
5,I was pleased with the work they did.
5,"Came on time, completed work, cleaned up."
5,"They came the same day that I called. They were on time and it only took them about 15 minutes to do the work. I had purchased a unit for $138 from Home Depot because I thought they would need the piece, however he told he didn’t need it. I was able to take it back and get a refund, so they ended up saving me some money as well."
5,"They charged on an hourly rate and they were expensive. However, they did a great job."
5,"I called Mr. Handyman, Alan, and explained to him it was an unusual job but after some discussion and feedback, I decided to go forward. The young man who came out was professional, on-time and friendly. I explained the service I needed completed and he got to work. When I returned at the end of the day I was very happy with the results. The workmanship was spot on and the detail was excellent. Basically he had to create a custom mount for the hoop and backboard. My father, who is an architect ""oversaw"" the work as I was not able to be there at the time. He was impressed with the detail and design that was put into the project. The only comment I would make is that this was a two person job and my dad had to help a couple of times. He is 70 and is not in the best shape so that made me uncomfortable. However it was a minor detail and overall the work was done to expectations. Based on this one experience I will utilize their services again. Thanks Mr. Handyman."
5,"They called me a little before the original time they had quoted to say he was available after his last appointment ended a little early. It was a good time for me, so he came out, looked over the job, put down a drop cloth, asked where he could access water, and then brought his tools in. He did a great job covering the crack in the ceiling and when he left, it wasn't quite dry, but looked much better. The next day, you wouldn't know there was ever a crack there."
5,They do the work on hourly basis. The man that they sent was flexible in terms of what he was able to do. He was quite pleasant and was willing to work with me. He was professional and friendly. It was the best price.
5,"I sent out quote requests to a few different companies and Mr. Handyman was the most responsive, the owner and I exchanged emails several times. Their price was good compared to the other estimates I got. I was not actually home when the work was completed, I was at work and my housemate was home instead. I would have asked for the mudding to be smoothed out a bit more, but I can't fault them for leaving it as they did as I was not there and it wasn't bad so I could not justify calling them back. I'm also a bit pickier than most people, ah well. I'd definitely hire them again though, so no true complaints only praises."
5,"The young man that was doing the work was very considerate because I was immobile, so he would take pictures of what he was doing and would come downstairs and show me each step of the project, and I thought that was pretty nice of him. They were a nice company to deal with. They were nice, good people. The price was fair. I had to check into some prices on their installation and I thought the price was fair for everything that they did. I might use them again for something else a couple of weeks from now. This was right before Christmas and I was surprised that they came out, when they did, I was very happy with them. They were here right on time, when they said they were going to be here. They said eight ‘O clock and they were here. The young man was very good at his job and what he did was excellent."
5,I think they did a good job and the workman arrived when he was supposed to. He was very courteous and friendly; I think he did a good job. I think the price was a little high for the amount of work that he did but it was something that needed to be done so it was fine. He was only here for a few hours.
5,They were fine and they did exactly what they needed to do.
5,"They really did an excellent job. They were responsive, punctual and professional."
5,"My 1st experience with this company and angie's list was very positive. I discussed that repairs were needed to the siding of the house and the contractor, Jeremiah, was out and fixed it within 2 days. He came out when they said he would. Jeremiah noted that the siding was originally installed incorrectly and that an option would be to replace vs repair it. I decided to just have it repaired for now. I inspected the finished work, and it was great. I was afraid the heavy winds we just experienced after he repaired it would rip it off again!I This company, Mr. Handyman, did a follow up call to see if I was satisfied. They ""get"" the importance of positive word of mouth and recommendations from angies list. This was a small job, only $170. but they did great. I recommend you call them for jobs including ""small"" jobs too!"
1,"Version:1.0 StartHTML:0000000105 EndHTML:0000002843 StartFragment:0000002290 EndFragment:0000002807 First they cound do all the work. They wouldn?t come to my home ti check out things and give an estimate. They wanted to come out and do the work, first hour $200 one person hour $100, how stupid do they think your members are. They should rename their company from ?Mr.Handyman? to ?Sucker Hunters?. This was my first Angie?s List experience. Hope not my last."
5,"After we dipped, stripped, sanded, primed and painted the 50 shutters, they needed to be rehung. The other company canceled out 4 times over a month (not due to the weather) so I fired them. I used Angie's List and called Mr. Handyman. Great response! They came out a few days later, arrived exactly on time, did all the work which took five hours and didn't even stop for lunch. They worked hard and rehung all my shutters. That is a ""fun"" job on a 40 foot ladder! We are totally satisfied with their responsiveness and work. The mechanics were friendly, did the work efficiently and well. They even found a woodpecker hole in a hidden area of the siding and fixed it. They just did it rather than diddle around waiting for an OK to spend 15 minutes on the task. That was appreciated."
5,"Was excellent job..just adding a review now ,because a neighbor needs Caulking done on their bathroom & possible tub door. They asked us who did ours ..I was sure it was Mr Handyman ,but was not sure of location. My cancelled check showed the Owings Mills location..The gentleman who did the work was the best, On time & our location is not always easy to find. Professional ,Friendly. I should have entered this review at time of the work , but just moved in and got busy. I would recommend them highly. I can't believe that others rated them B on pricing .I was thrilled with the price , I absolutely got what I paid for if not more. A+ in my book"
5,He completed all the repairs correctly and quick. He was all business and everything he fixed is working properly. I was satisfied with his work but I do feel he could have completed the work a little bit cleaner which is just a minor detail. On a scale of 1-10 I would give him a 9.
5,"We were impressed from start to finish. We have done a lot of remodeling on our 1920's bungalow ourselves over the years so we appreciate what goes into labor. When I described our project to Ken over the phone he immediately knew what needed to be done and how long it would take so we felt like he ""knew his stuff."" When I called to schedule the appointment they were able to perform the job within a few days. They arrived early making it more convenient for us and they finished the job in less time than we expected. We know that cutting through plaster and lathe is messy job and we were impressed with how clean they kept everything. We were very pleased with their service and would definitely recommend them and plan on using them for future projects."
5,"Could not be happier with the entire job. He not only did excellent work throughout the entire process, but several times gave me suggestions that would save me money on the repairs. He was able to fix a basement water problem that led to water damage that another Handyman service failed to solve."
5,"I contacted Mr. Handyman to get a leak (from rains) in my garage and bathroom repaired. I had got this problem looked at in the past and all previous repairs did not work. The service professional from Mr. Handyman arrived for the appointment on time. He detected the cause of the leak and made another appointment to come out and fix it as the job would have taken a long time to finish.As this was a two person job the owner also came to assist on the day of the job. The job was done very well and with meticulous attention to detail. He explained the problems that he saw and even took photographs of the areas that were causing the leaks and texted them to me later. To my delight, after completing the job the owner followed up with me after the first major rain storm. The leak had been mostly plugged but I could still see a little bit of water coming through. He came out again within the next 2 days, retested for the leak, and again spent 2 to 3 hours fixing the issue."
5,"This was my first experience with Angie's List and also the first tiem hiring a handyman. I was very impressed with Mr. Handyman. They were very responsive, punctual, and professional. I would definitely use this company again."
5,"Mr Handyman is very professional, start to finish. They called to let me know the approximate time the worker was coming, then they followed up to make sure I was happy with the work. The Handyman was very nice, clean and knowledgeable. He installed 3 light fixtures, one which had a slight problem in how the previous fixture was hung and he handled that no problem. I was very happy with their work and their responsiveness to my needs."
1,"Very unprofessional and prejudice. Update 8/27/2012: After I left my review on Angie's List Mr. Deitch called me on Monday morning and harassed and threatened me regarding the review. I found that his professionalism has its limits. He is very responsive, which I appreciated, but I strongly suggest hiring someone else."
5,"A big thanks to Alan and Brian! I needed a very important job done the next day. It turned out to require MUCH more time than anticipated (because i was in a panic and did not state the number of windows). But Alan adjusted the work schedule for the day, took one of the jobs himself and my job was completed that day! Brian worked so hard in the heat and was kind and professional. Thank you so much!"
1,"Mr. Handyman, Ken, cancelled my appointment three times; he said that he had emergencies each time. I rescheduled my appointment each time to get estimates for home repairs. The latest appointment was today and he just didn't show up. I called the office to see if he was indeed coming after he didn't show up at the appointment time. At this point, I told the people in the office to just not even send him. This was my 1st and last experience with Mr. Handyman. If Ken really didn't want the job, he should have never set the appointments. Very disappointed..."
3,"The company is very responsive and I appreciated being able to communicate via email. I asked for and got an estimate. Although I confirmed the appointment for a certain time the contractor had a scheduling problem and had to arrive about 1 hour later. Especially after reading the prices for the work performed for others in their reviews, and realizing the actual work that was performed for me, I believe I paid too much for the work."
5,"Alan returned my initial phone call immediately and although the job was small one, he still accommodated us. At all times he and his partner were very professional and courteous. Thank you very much!"
5,"Mr Handyman is the best! Called Alan and set up an appt. Alan is very accomodating and knows his stuff. Anthony came out on the scheduled day right on time and ready to work. I cannot say enough about Anthony. He is hard-working, professional, very knowledgable, and extremely respectful of your home and family. You can tell he tries very hard to make the ""someone in your house working"" aspect as non-intrusive as possible. But on top of all this is the actual work he does. All I can say is he is a perfectionist. Impeccable! We love our new bathroom, because it really does look like a brand new bathroom. We are already making plans to have him come out again. Thank you Alan and Anthony!"
5,"After trying and failing to replace a leaking water line to my refrigerator myself I scheduled a repair appointment with Sears only to be contacted the day of that they don't do plumbing. I had some electrical work that needed to be done as well, so I looked for someone who could do both. I was a little hesitant to use a handyman company due to a previous experience when the repairman was unable to complete the work I specifically requested, and I ended up looking for things for him to do since I had to pay anyway. The benefit of having one person do it all led me to call Mr Handyman of Baltimore County. I called early in the morning and they were able to fit me in that afternoon. I was reassured that if they were unable to do the work as promised, I would not be charged. The repairman showed up an hour early. He was very efficient in his work and had a clear understanding of what was involved. He was able to perform both the plumbing and electrical work and was kind enough to let me watch so I could understand what I had done wrong with the refrigerator line. I had been told ahead of time to pick up the replacement items I wanted and I did have to run back to the hardware store while the repairman was here to exchange one of the items, but that allowed him to keep working. He finished all the work in a little over 2 hours and left everything very neat. I thought it was expensive, but if I had hired a plumber and an electrician I'm sure it would have cost me more and I would have had to find time in my schedule for 2 appointments. Overall I was very pleased and would hire them again."
4,"Called company via listing number on Angie's List. Was able to make contact with Alan right away who discussed job, asked for digital photos and quoted rates. We initially thought it was a post in the ground but after taking pictures I found out that the post was bolted onto the side of the stairs. I also discovered that the top-knob decoration on the existing post was a separate piece of decorative wood that would be removable. I had paint on hand from a new paint job that was completed in the prior couple of weeks. Alan scheduled a visit for Friday May 4 and estimated that the total work would probably be 4 hours, including time taken to source the 4x4 post, prepare it, mount it and paint it. Given cost of supplies and Mr. Handyman's hourly rates, the estimate was right on the money. Overall work was passable if not totally matching. The major missing parts were small and I discovered them well after providing payment: - The corners of the replacement wood were not sanded/beveled, so they don't quite exactly match the rest of the bannister.- The reused top decoration for the post was not remounted entirely centered. Painting was decent and matched. All other work was done satisfactorily, but the waste was not disposed of (this was part of the original understanding and quote). Overall, a good job, with some minor quality issues that prevent an all A's rating, but a good effort. I got what I paid for."
5,"The ""handyman"" that came was professional, and polite, did the prescribed work and even followed me to the home improvement store to get the replacement door. Cant say enough good things about the final product. The only downside is it was a bit pricey, but for the service provided, excellent!"
5,I contacted Alan on Monday about the work to be done. He had a man at my house on Wednesday morning. We went over the work to be done and I left him alone. In a few hours he was done and my steps were once again safe to walk on.
5,"Don arrived right on time and easily installed a new (replacement) lighting fixture over my dining table. He was very patient with my fretting about the height of the pendant over the table! I also had him do some exterior touch up painting to keep my HOA happy. I had thought I should replace my louvred gable vent with a pvc one, but when he went up to measure it, it wasn't in as bad shape as I'd thought, so he just puttied and repainted it. And he measured it so that when I do need to get it replaced, I'll know the correct size. He was very nice, pleasant, and knowledgable. I have used Mr. Handyman before and will use them in the future."
5,I think it is a franchise. They are fabulous. I have used them on numerous occasions and they do everything. They are not cheap but they work well and they are very efficient. They do the work right and they are fair. I would use their services again in the future.
5,"They were on time, and they got the job done quickly. They were very thorough."
5,"Great company. Honest, punctual and stands by their work"
5,It was a very good experience. The name of the person who came out was Peter and he was very efficient. He seemed to know exactly what he had to do and did it and did it in good time. He cleaned up after himself. I would use them again in the future.
4,Overall work was great. Called back about 3 times to get more things done. A little expensive due to pay scale but worht it.
5,"He was punctual, professional, and productive with his time."
5,"As usual Chris did an excellent job. He arrived on time and got right to work, as their price is calculated at an hourly rate. Upon creating an opening to our attic, we found out that the were nests that birds have built throughout the years. Chris cleaned the mess and nests and enclosed our attic vents with wiry mesh to alleviate the bird problem. Again he stayed over (not included in the price) and answered questions and quoted us on future jobs. I think that they are a little pricey but what you pay for is what you get and it is well worth it. I believe that Chris has become our official handyman! Also, Alan is a pleasure to speak with on the phone!"
5,Professional work performed by Sean. Job site was kept neat and clean during and at the conclusion of the service call. Time was well managed. Could'nt have gone better.
5,"From start to finish I felt comfortable with this company. Reading the reviews about this company, I had high expectations. And they showed up! Alan was very pleasent, patient, friendly and professional when I spoke with him on the phone to make the appointment. Chris came to our house and did the job as promised. He showed and was very professional and pleasent to talk to. He came and got right to work after listening to all of my concerns; he was extremely efficient and didn't waste any time. After he was done he stayed and spoke with me and my husband about concerns and questions we had about other jobs we are planning. He is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I am looking forward to their services again and I absolutely reccommend them for any work that you might have. Well done!"
5,They came out same day for appointment and commenced work following day. Completed day after that. Very responsive and professional.
4,"Great, and our handyman was very pleasant and courteous and thoughtful in his work and remarks."
5,"I was super happy with them! They were responsive, showed up on time, professional, and the work was done as promised. I would highly recommend them."
5,"It looks terrific. He measured thoroughly and always asked us what we wanted before doing anything so it was just how we wanted. He was a little slow which did effect price, but I think it was because he was being so careful, which we really appreciated."
5,Everything was great. Very professional and punctual. Were willing to come out same day. We will definitely hire them again!
5,Excellent from start to finish. Couldn't be happier
4,"They are pretty good. I haven't had any problems with them. It is the second thing I have had done. The price is a little high, but their service is worth it. I had to call back a couple of times to get them so I can't give them highest marks for responsiveness. I will use them again in the future."
5,"I called Mr. Handyman in the morning for an estimate to install a new over the range microwave. They were able to have someone out in the afternoon of the same day to complete the job! The technician was on time, very friendly, very clean and very fast. I highly recommend Mr. Handyman."
5,No surprises all was explained before hand. Doug did an excellent job. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Ken Dunn's operation and especially Doug . We have been using Ken's Mr. Handyman since 2009. We have always been pleased and have recommended him t several people.
5,"The technician was very prompt and arrived at the scheduled time. I explained what I wanted done. He did the work in the order that I wanted done. In the repairs of the window, he also cleaned off putty that has been put on by other parties. He blew off the roof with a small electric blower that was barely up to what was required. He was very good at checking the gutters for cleanliness. The repairs to the two sections of gutter that had been damaged by falling branches were makeshift. He did not explain any alternate solutions such as replacement of the sections. I was impressed by how quickly he worked but would have been happier with a better repair of the gutters."
5,"The experience was very good. They price was reasonable, and he was very responsive."
5,excellent service from start to finish will use again
3,"Overall, the experience was okay. He was able to find & fix the leak, but he ended up cutting a hole in the ceiling of my living room without offering any way of fixing the hole, even if there would have been an initial charge. He stapled some Saran wrap on the ceiling where the hole is. Now I'm in the process of fixing the ceiling hole through another vendor."
5,"The project(s) went very well and were completed in less time than I had expected. The technician was very competent, professional, personable, and well organized. He also provided some valuable tips and advice regarding a couple of other issues."
5,"Chris with Mr Handyman was EXCELLENT!! He completed several handyman tasks on my ~80 year-old home this fall. He was efficient, professional and very pleasant. He completed the work more quickly than anticipated, and made helpful suggestions for cost-saving options. He even cleaned up after himself! I will definitely use him for my future handyman needs."
3,This member has no knowledge of how this review has become associated with this member’s account.
5,"Mr. Handyman came promptly at 800am went over the checklist and got to work, went through the checklist item by item, did not waste anytime, worked hard, took a 15min break for lunch, finished at 430pm. Finally after many many months my long list was done in one-day. Amazing."
5,I called Mr. Handyman in the morning and they sent a technician the same afternoon. He arrived (his name is Mr. White) on time with a smile on his face and a professional attitude. He was eager to help tackle the two pictures. He explained the billing process clearly and began installing the molding. He also offered time saving tips (since I was charged by the half hour) like opening products to be used and arranging them around the room where they needed to be placed. Mr. White was thorough in centering the frames and installed the undercounter lights neatly and quickly. I was well pleased with these services and will call them today for another project!
5,"We were very pleased with our experience. The handyman did a great job, and there were three things that stood out for us: 1. Punctuality and promptness, start to finish. I got a fast callback after I submitted my inquiry on the web and the handyman was right on time. 2. We really felt like he was trying to do his best for us - pointing out things that could be done on our own easily, and mentioning a couple of roofing issues that he discovered while cleaning the gutters (and was able to fix right away). We appreciated the honesty and felt like they were really intending to provide us value for our money. 3. He even gave us some tips on how to do a couple of jobs that we plan to do ourselves better/more easily. We will definitely call them again the next time we have a need for handyman services!"
5,"They come on time, they clean up after themselves, and they do the work with minimal hassle. They have came out twice and I would reccomend them highly."
5,"First of all, I submitted a request for service online, and literally someone called me within a half hour of my request. The person who called me was the owner, and he was extremely nice. The handyman comes in a market van, and he worked very neatly and was very professional. He seemed able to do a lot of things. He did an excellent job on the guest room - - and the repairs needed were pretty extensive. He was unable to repair the ceiling fan because it needed a part; it wasn't the easiest to troubleshoot - - but I felt he understood all the possible issues and worked to isolate the problem. All in all, I just found it so nice that in one phone call you could have multiple projects done - - so simple."
5,"the fix was perfect. Technician was on time, and creative in the fix."
5,"Mr. Handyman was outstanding. The work was finished timely and the estimates were close to the actual bill. It was wonderful to have Mr. Handyman fix the issues that came with my new home, allowing me to come home and relax."
5,Great. They came when they said and did the work quickly and well.
5,"He was great. The whole experience with this company was great, the went way beyond what most companies would do. Since I live out of state they made me feel very confident about my property. I will use them again and recommend the to others in that area."
5,"Mr. Handyman called me back. After I explained what I need to have done, he told me that this particular job really required a licensed plumber. So he gave me a referral to a plumber and I have been very happy with the referral. I really appreciated Mr. Handyman's honesty, professionalism, anmd integrity."
5,"The service is extremely professional and convenient to use. Great for an out of town landlord. They take time to explain work etc. Rates are high given that I've found good handy men for ~$50/hr etc. However, if you need to insure you get a dependable and trustworthy contractor, this is an excellent option."
5,"They were very professional, responsive and easy to work with in all cases. I actually referred them to several of my friends and will use them in the future."
5,"He was punctual and very professional and courteous. He did an excellent job, and even went to the store to get the right shade of paint since the one I had was no longer good. He was neat and did not leave a mess. I was very happy with everything that was done."
5,"The job went well, with good results."
5,"Extremely pleased. The project turned out better than I ever could have imagined. Their professionalism was exceptional. I felt comfortable leaving them my keys and they completed the bulk of the work while I was out of town. The hourly rate of this company is a bit hirer than others, but they are extremely quick, efficient and professional in the execution fo the projects. I believe in the end the total price is lower than their competitors because they finish projects in much less time, and the end results are impeccable."
5,"Task1. was installed in two visits. First visit involved repair of two 24""x30"" holes created by removal of two in-wall air conditioning units by HVAC contractor. Units were in the knee walls of the third floor of our 1935 wood shingle home. Chris arrived promptly, as scheduled, sized up job and worked diligently, most of which was on done on the ladder. He successfully found a lumberyard that had shingles that matched those on our house, primed and painted the installed shingles. Work was done so seamlessly that you can't tell where the repairs were made. Second visit involved removal of an in-wall window size air conditioning unit on the first floor. Repairs were made to the exterior shingled wall as well as drywall repair to the interior wall. Again, Chris was able to find a lumberyard that carried molding that matched the existing interior molding. The first two jobs were so well done, we consulted with Alan and Chris about Task 2, installing hardwood flooring in our third floor master bedroom. Previous owners had converted the attic into a master bedroom suite. Original flooring was pine with wall-to-wall carpeting. Stairs leading to third floor were also pine. Alan estimated material needed and provided suggestions of where to find good quality flooring at reasonable prices. Following selection of flooring and stairs, we called Alan to schedule installation of the flooring while we were on vacation. We returned home to a beautifully installed floor and stairs. We had one minor mishap, during the flooring installation. Sawing of the flooring tripped our smoke alarm. Chris immediately called us to let us know what had happened (seconds after being called by ADT), we were able to arrange for ADT to turn off the alarm. To avoid any chance of a recurrence, Chris performed all additional sawing outside. All work was done extremely professionally and clean up was excellent"
2,"On 1/20, I spoke with Ken and scheduled an appointment for 9:00 AM on 1/26 for an estimate. When no one arrived by 9:20, I called the office. Ken could not locate the painter and did not know why he did not show up. The estimate was recheduled for 1/27 at 8:30. When his painter arrived the next day, there was no apology offered. I showed him the work to be done and he told me Ken would call me the next day. I did not get a phone call on 1/28, so I called Ken on 1/29. His receptionist told me he would call me right back in a few minutes. No phone call. I called back 90 minutes later and was told by the receptionist that an estimate would be mailed that day. On 2/2, there was still no estimate. I called once more and was told it was mailed last week. It is now 8 days later and I still have no estimate, verbal or written, from this company."
5,"This is the best experience I have ever had with a home handyman (in 35 years of hiring them). I was doubtful based on past experience that this could go very well, but was so very pleasantly surprised. Not cheap, but given that he didn't waste my time or his, he had proper equipment, and he was knowledgeable I think it was well worth the cost."
5,"Chris was on time, very polite, and professional. He completed the job in a timely manner. The chair rail looks great. He cut each piece at a 45 degree angle so they fit together seamlessly. Then he caulked all the nail holes and seams. The only problem was that the job took longer than the manager had estimated on the phone, so it was more pricey than we originally thought. Other than that, we were very pleased with the work!"
5,"Alan and Chris are both experienced contracters and they do superb work. They did not waste time, were cooperative and friendly. ."
5,They came and did a whole day's worth of work. The price was a little high but it's hard for a handyman not to charge that much.
5,The person that showed up knew what he was doing. He was easy to direct and worked efficiently.
5,Outstanding job. Very satisfied.
5,Very well.
5,They were very helpful.
5,"They were excellent. They had a 4-hour minimum. They were extremely good. Whatever I asked the tech to do, he did. I would certainly hire him again. He cleaned up and everything was left in fine condition. The price was good because it would have been difficult to coordinate that many different people to do the various jobs."
5,The time to do the requested jobs was pretty much on target. I felt like they were using their time wisely and efficiently. This fellow that they sent out clearly knew what he was doing and was able to tick the items off the list that we needed.
5,"I called the company on Friday evening and got the answering service who told me the company would be in touch with me on Monday morning. They called around 8:30 AM Monday and asked me to describe the work. He told me they charge $138.00 for the first hour or fraction thereof and $88 for each additional hour which is billed in 15 minute increments at $22. When I agreed he said they would be out between 1:00 and 3:00 PM Monday, and would call approximately 1/2 hour before arriving. They called back around 9:45 AM and said they were running ahead of schedule and could come earlier if it was convenient for me, which it was. At about 10:30 AM the technician arrived. I showed him the electric eye and the dryer. He set about his work and was finished in about 45 minutes. I inspected the work and he did an excellent job, I was quite pleased."
5,"Very punctual. Work was of high quality. Although cost of replacing screens was high, I can't say if someone who charges by the job would have been less. The job took longer then originally thought, but removing the old screens was more difficult then expected. This was because of the way siding around the area had been attached by someone else. The quality of the work was excellent so the cost was worth it. Worker was professional and personable. I would use them again, and plan to in the fall for some jobs we discussed. Highly recommended."
4,"The deck job that they did for us went very well. The price was reasonable and the quality of work was great. I had called the company again for another estimate on a different job. I talked to the receptionist in the office and she said she'd take the message. However, I never got a call back from the company. This was the only bad experience that we had with this company."
5,"Mr. Handyman showed up at the time appointed, dressed in a uniform and driving a Van with a Mr. Handyman advertisement on it. This was good because I live in a small condominium and it is reassuring to elderly neighbors. The A/C units had been permanently installed in old casement windows on the 2nd floor, so I was very reluctant to tackle the removal on my own. He had the units out very quickly and used storm windows to create a replacement pane. There was time left so he unclogged some drains, which I was very glad because one turned out to be completely rusted through. I had to get a different plumber to replace that drain, because it is a very old building and we only use one licensed plumber. But I had Mr Handyman come back to fix some tiles. I also had holes in the ceiling from where the electrician had been. Mr. Handyman fixed those holes beautifully! I could tell this guy had extensive experience with drywall. I dealt with Ken on the phone and 2 different guys came out to do the work. Ken is very easy to deal with and they are professional. I am pleased to have the work done (so is my husband! I got rid of the ""honey-do list"")."
5,The experience was great with the office staff and Alan who was efficient and very professional and explained the process as he was doing the projects.
5,"I had a shower installed by a reputable contractor. Unfortunately, his installation of the shower was not up to code and the drain failed, which caused a massive leak in my kitchen ceiling. I called Mr. Handyman, and they sent a technician, who replaced the drywall in the ceiling and feathered the edges so that the patch will look like the remainder of the kitchen ceiling. It was nice to have a contractor, show up on time, be experienced, clean up, and be able to speak and understand English. I would highly recommend this company."
5,"Excellent experience. The process of making the appointment was easy and professional. The representative (Alan) was punctual, professional, knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. He showed concern in maximizing the efficient use of time, readily answered questions, and offered helpful suggestions. Would gladly use this firm again, and am planning to do so in the future."
5,"They gave me an estimate over the phone. They were able to do the work sooner than scheduled. He hustled and did not waste any time. He was helpful, knowledgeable, and eager to do the work. He was honest and did not try to sell me things that I didn't need. They are accommodating."
5,They came when they said they were going to come. They handyman who came out was very thorough and reliable. They did what they said they were gonna do.
5,"We called Mr. Handyman, based on reports in Angie's List, about a week ago, and were able to schedule the work within the week. Before Alan appeared, the company called to confirm the appointment. Alan showed up exactly on time, and worked steadily all day long until the job was completed. His boss, Alan Deitch, even appeared early on to see how things were going, and stayed for quite awhile to help. We were very pleased with the professionalism of the two men who showed up, and the excellent job that was done to reroof our shed. It is now better than it was when it was new."
5,"He arrived on time, dressed in uniform with a truck full of what he needed to make that floor perfect. He replaced one full sheet of plywood, purchasing and hauling a new sheet of plywood up to my third floor (no elevator) co-op, and hauled away and disposed of the old sheet of plywood. He was pleasant, polite, knowledgeable and efficient. The dispatcher was also wonderful, calling to tell me that he might be early. She was efficient and very personable as well. I will definitely use them again!"
5,They have come several times and done some small and large jobs for us. They have remodeled several rooms for us and have done a wonderful job. We have been very satisfied with the services they have done for us. The technician that was assigned to us has been excellent and very detail oriented.
5,"He arrived on time & was very helpful. My only small concern was that he needed to spend part of his time going to the store to buy the threshold piece. Since I'd told the company ahead of time I thought that was needed, it would have been nice if they had sent that along. (In retrospect, he also could have given me a shopping list so I could get it while he was shaving the door). The run to the store added a fair amt of time to the job. Overall, it went well. I'm glad he was there because I also had a plumber doing other work who needed a hand getting an old water heater out of the house, and it was fortunate that Mr Handyman was there to, well, be handy. I'd use them again, but only if I had enough tasks to take at least 2 hr, and if possible I'd try to have supplies available (I could always return unneeded parts)."
1,"Overall this went badly. The work was done poorly, I felt very overcharged and cheated. The worker came on time, started with the Lazy Susan, moved on to the toilet paper holder and then left my home. He returned about 15 minutes later and finished all work after one hour and 10 minutes, not two hours. I was charged for two hours and parts: Spackle, drywall putty, screen, 50 lb. dry wall anchors, which he went to the hardware store to buy. I think a handyman service, especially when they know the job to be done, should be prepared with the appropriate parts. The ceiling was a mess when he left, screen showing, not smoothed off at all. Lazy Susan broke again about two weeks later."
5,"The work was outstanding. I had asked for around five estimates before I hired him and even if he was not the cheapest one, the price was completely fair and reasonable. I called and they gave me an estimate over the phone."
5,He was very thorough. He actually showed me what he was doing and overall he was very professional. I even added a job while he was here and he was able to take care of that for me.
5,"I would definitely call this company again. They were courteous over the phone, and Dave was prompt, friendly, and worked like a dog. The project went into a second day, and the company rescheduled Dave so that he could come back two days after the first one to finish the job."
4,"Overall the job went well. We set up an appointment for three weeks after we called. Mr. Handyman called a few days before the appointment to confirm. On the day of the appointment, we received a call from the contractor letting us know that the employee that was scheduled to come out to the house had called out sick. They did send another employee out that same day to do the work. John, did come later than we scheduled for. He arrived at 4:35 p.m. and got right to work on the dry rot. While the wood filler was drying, he replaced the shutters. John told us that the wood filler was not completely dry so he would have to return the next day. He did return at 5:55 p.m. the next day to paint the wood. It took a little under an hour. When we checked the work everything seemed fine, but the next day we noticed that the wood filler had sunken in. We wrote to Mr. Handyman to let them know and they promptly sent John and another employee out to correct the problem at no charge."
5,"Called on a Tues. & was told Thu. & Fri. were available. On Wed., these times were gone; I couldn't find anyone else, so on Thu., set up appt. for following Thu. They are pricey: $216 for the first 2 hours, thereafter billed in 15 min increments @$88/hr. For that price, you get highly qualified technician. We opted to buy most of the stuff beforehand, but the tech did need to shop for some specialty items. The tech was supposed to show up at 8a, but had car trouble. Mary, the office mgr., called me at 8:05a to let me know this; he showed up at 9a and finished by 2p. Most impressive: fixing the kitchen exhaust fan; it would been quite costly to replace this. He also didn't have to replace the garbage disposal as we thought was necessary: wires just needed to be connected correctly. The tech was pleasant and knowledgeable. Mary was very helpful on the initial call. Would definitely use them again and highly recommend them to others."
5,"Allen, the manager was professional providing an estimate on the phone when I called for a job. The job I described sounded like 2-3 hours job and Rickie came 30min. late due to an accident on the road. One of the problem was a long hole on the main door and Rickie suggested that the door is not secure and I decided to replace it. It ended up costing me a lot, but I think it was a right decision. I could tell he had done it many many times. We went to shopping, he took the old doors and everything out, adjusted the wall from 83inches to 80 inches and put the new doors in. It was great that even though he was supposed to be there for 2-3hours, he asked Allen to move other schedule and stayed a whole day to get it done. He cared details and the job was done well."

5,"American Home Improvement gave me a beautiful kitchen and bathroom. Everything from plumping, electric, and asbestos removal was performed professional and timely. The price was fully discussed and agreed on, there were no surprises. My project manager Shawn walked me through each step, keeping me up to date on everything. Great experience!"
5,"They did my kitchen last month. David was the one that did the design, based on my instructions. I put quartz in the kitchen and at the bar. Amazingly cut and finished. They are a bit pricey but the quality is great. I have an open concept design and I've received a lot of compliments for my kitchen. I would recommend them to anyone that has the budget to invest in quality cabinets. They also did my bar."
5,American Home Improvement is a very good remodeling company. They fixed my issue with the kitchen in no time at all. The people from there was very nice and polite when working and did everything with caution as to not cause any problems when working. I liked their work ethics and I recommend them to you too!
5,AHI did a phenomenal remodel of my kitchen. They were professional throughout the whole project and answered all questions I had. End result was just as I expected and nothing less than what they had promised. Really happy and impressed with their work. Thanks a lot! I highly recommend this company!
5,My kitchen design is much better than before thanks to team AHI. Their team is very professional and able to imply the design I had told them at a great accuracy! Super friendly people and very good customer service. It was a pleasure doing business with them!
5,"I had American Home Improvement Inc to renovate my washroom. From the beginning of the job we felt completely comfortable with AHI crew. They were on time, courteous and professional. I will definitely use them soon for my next reno!"
5,"We are very pleased with how our kitchen has turned out. David had great ideas and suggestions on design, and helped us pull the whole look together. All the work was done in a very professional manner, and has a high quality, and clean look. All the contractors involved in our reno were extremely hard working and friendly. American Home Improvement Inc installed our cabinets, and worked long hours, and were happy to help with any of our requests. They took care of every little detail."
5,"We just completed a bathroom remodel with Jack Mair of American Home Improvement. From start to finish, the entire experience was fantastic. Jack communicated with us consistently and was very patient when there were COVID shipping delays. Every specialist that came to our home was excellent, and they were especially responsive in fixing final details like slightly crooked shelves and grout.  I would definitely work with the company again, especially Jack."
5,"I had the pleasure of working with Ben at AHI for a bathroom renovation and change of bedroom flooring in my condo.  My unit was built in 2001, and it was screaming, ""Outdated!""  Ben presented some ideas that upgraded my unit to present time.  He worked around my budget and was able to improvise when needed.  The team that Ben put together for my projects was AMAZING!!  Felix's team handled my flooring, and I absolutely love it!!  Jose and Romeo created the bathroom of my dreams.  Julian completed my dream bathroom with a custom shower door.  The quality and beauty of a custom shower door from Julian will make you frown upon any other kind of shower door... it's a game changer.  All teams were respectful of my unit by being extra clean and noise-conscious when removing the prior flooring and demolishing the bathroom.  Everyone working on my projects was detail-oriented, diligent and stayed on track with the projected date of completion.  Ben visited my unit regularly to monitor the progress of the projects.  He also assisted with answering any questions that the HOA had.  All in all, my experience with AHI was extremely positive.  Everything is beautiful - the outcome exceeds my expectations!  In addition, everything was completed within budget and on time.  Looking forward to reaching out to Ben again for my next project."
5,We renovated our whole kitchen with AHI. It turned out very good and looks great! They had to come back and fix a few things which they did willingly and quickly. We're really pleased with it and would definitely recommend.
5,"I have had a kitchen designed and installed and recently had a bathroom designed and installed by American Home Improvement. This company comes highly recommended, as they are professional and provide high quality products with reasonable pricing. What sets them apart in my opinion is the after sales service. Once your project is complete they don't disappear, as if you have deficiencies they will go above and beyond to make it right. I have dealt with Sam on both projects and he was great, not pushy and provided great insight into the designs. I recently recommended AHI to friends and they got their kitchen installed and were pleased with the entire process. First class company and a delight to deal with!"

Our contractor Jack is very detail oriented and has extensive knowledge.  The sub contractors were courteous and worked around our schedule.  I was always asked at the end of the day if there was anything else that I wanted done and they responded to my needs.  They always cleaned up after they were completed for the day. The craftsmanship was outstanding.  Jack was very patient with us.  Some of our decisions took a little time.

Our Project Manager Neev was very professional, organized and provided a lot of ideas and resources for us to get to the design we wanted.  Neev was able to navigate through the workplace COVID restrictions, ensuring that only the necessary employees are on site with proper PPE and social distancing.  Neev made sure we were on track to procure what we needed. Neev was able to orchestrate the project despite the pandemic-imposed supply chain limitations that impacted delivery of the important construction materials (hardwood floors for the entire 2,800 sq. ft. house, tiles, etc.).

From day one to the day they left it was always a pleasure dealing with them. The end product is better than we hoped. They are not the cheapest out there but I believe the price reflects their dedication and attention to detail.

I highly recommend AHI to anyone looking for a contractor you can trust. I hope they stay in business forever, we will use them for all future renovations."
5,"I hired Hollywood Builders for a full kitchen remodel. Eli was able to look at photos of kitchens or parts of kitchens I like and came up with a design that was a great starting point. What I appreciated was how he was able to understand my style almost immediately. During the actual remodel, I was most impressed with just how quickly and easily any small mistakes (and they do happen) were rectified. The final product was just amazing! It looks great, but the best feeling was unpacking all my boxes full of kitchen stuff and finding that everything had it’s place, every drawer was used well, and there were no awkward or odd spaces that I wished I had done something different with. This kitchen is super functional and a pure joy to cook in and show off to my with family and friends."
5,"We had AHI team to do a complete renovation of a penthouse apartment, including the entire kitchen, two bathrooms and doors.

I would highly recommend American Home Improvement for any kind of  apartment renovation/construction work."

The completed job was of high quality and exceeded my expectations. They finished ahead of schedule and on budget. They cleaned up very well and left the place spotless. Thank you again American Home Improvement Inc! And the crew for a great job!"
5,Got a full bathroom remodeling done by American Home Improvement Inc Inc and I'm loving it. They provided me with a catalogue at first but I didn't quite like them so I gave them ideas and they got the 3D model ready which looked absolutely fantastic. And after confirming that they started working here which was done very smoothly. And now the completed product looks absolutely sunning and I love it. They are great to say the least.
5,"I am SO happy with my renovation! I had two structural walls removed, a complete kitchen re-do as well as new floors, lighting, baseboards and ceilings throughout the main living space of my house. David , Sam and the guys were phenomenal--they came in on budget, three weeks ahead of schedule, and everything was of the finest quality. It was a real pleasure to work with them, so much so that they will be renovating the other half of my house this summer. If I could rate them 6 out of 5, I would!"
5,Sam team are incredible! Don't bother looking anywhere else. They are worth every penny and they do a fantastic job. They went above and beyond on the job we were quoted and then noticed our main entry walls were a little beaten up....came back the next day with a quart of paint and spent extra time doing touch ups. We have very high expectations and they always meet them.
5,"American Home Improvement Inc provided a very high quality result for our bath remodel project. They were easy to communicate with, providing input when needed while still adhering to our rather detailed vision. Once started all work proceeded steadily and without delay. Work areas were kept neat and adjacent rooms well protected throughout construction. Cost was very reasonable."
5,"American Home Improvement Inc team went the extra mile and did all the other extras for me within the time frame they were given. They only added couple of months more for doing all the other changes which we couldn't leave for later. They helped me with picking all the finishing and consulted me about trying new ideas and textures, which I was hesitant about at the beginning, but since I was familiar with their work and design, we agreed to have it done the way they designed and we love everything now. I will definitely work with them again."
5,Sam and his team did an amazing job in creating our small builder kitchen into a Wonderful/Awesome Kitchen and made us a beautiful bar. I would recommend their services to everyone I know due to their excellent and efficient team. They listen to your needs and provide an optimum solution to make you smile.
5,"American Home Improvement Inc was recommended by a friend & they did not disappoint. David got back to us quickly and came by for a quote shortly after.

5,"Even thinking of remodeling our kitchen was enough to drive me up the walls. We finally decided to pull the trigger and get estimates. After multiple estimates we where over the moon when we found AHI! David, the project manager, took his time and reviewed all the details with us. He made sure to never to make us feel rushed or pressured into buying anything. From when the job started to when it finished everything that Davidsaid would be done was done. There where some hiccups, some delays, but we where prepared for it all. Overall, I will recommend Davidsaid and AHI Builders to all my friends, family, and clients!!"
5,"They redid our kitchen and both bathrooms. A complete refurbish of these rooms. All new cabinets, floors, counter tops, painting, and reset necessary electrical components. We would certainly have them back. Great job."

I'm happy, my wife's happy thanks to Benjamin and AHI."
5,"American Home Improvement remodel our home. We upgraded our kitchen and bathrooms, installed hardwood flooring and repainted the interior and exterior of our house. We were so impressed with their attention to detail, and how well organized the construction company runs. The entire project was handled professionally and the final result was a reflection of our taste. Our kitchen and bathroom remodel came out better than we expected. During the work that they did at my house, I could see that they are detail oriented, hardworking and skilled. They did the work remarkably beautiful. My old kitchen was demolished completely and they installed new plumbing, cabinets, lightings and appliances while in the bathroom they replaced the tub and shower while installing new floor, hardware and vanity with double sink. During the work, I noticed that Daniel was very honest and fair with me while having excellent communication skills as well. I didn't experienced any hidden charges or additional extras. With my past experience it was hard to find a team who knows their work so well and that honesty is their main factor. I would definitely work with them again!!!"
5,"After three weeks, just got started. I'll let you know. I will update the rating when the work is completed.  While I would have liked to have more work done, the work Micky did was more than I thought was possible, on my budget. He was always very professional and kept me up to date. I don't know if it was the time of year that delayed the work, but I'm very happy with the end results."
4,"After interviewing several contractors, we hired AHI to remodel our master bathroom, guest bathroom, and laundry room. Within hours of initially contacting them, AHI sent a project manager, Neev, to our house to generate a quote. From the outset, Neev was detail oriented, picked up on issues that other contractors had missed, and sat down with us to generate a quote on-site. AHI’s quote was comparable to other bids, so we ultimately chose them for the project because they seemed the most service-oriented and capable of delivering what we wanted. I’m glad we did.

Neev was very responsive, communicative, and organized throughout the project. He helped us work through a couple of issues that arose in renovating a 100-year old house without nickel-and-diming us.  His foreman, Tal, was very hands-on and helped us settle some design issues, and the entire crew was polite and respectful of our home. Despite some setbacks, the team finished on time and we are thrilled with the work."
5,Shawn was wonderful. He came out same day for a quote and was available soon after for another project. He was respectful and great at communicating the steps along the way. It was better than I could imagine! Thanks!

The job was completed in 30 days, work was up to par as expected. I knew i was in good hands from the beginning of the job.  I've been meaning to write this review for a while because this company deserves it, thank you American Home Improvement."
5,"American Home Improvement Inc has helped us turn our house into a beautiful, warm home.

He was never in a rush, so open to conversation, and actively listened to what our expectations were for our project. Neev always carried himself with utmost professionalism, while establishing and maintaining a personal relationship, with constant, open and timely communication.

Everything was checked over by someone with an eye for detail and it passed with flying colors. I would definitely American Home Improvement.
5,"We chose American Home Improvement  for a large kitchen and bathroom project that took 2+ months. It was a fantastic decision because the crew treated us like family, were incredibly communicative, and professional, kind and did a fantastic job. Even when they did the initial demolition, they left our house swept and ready for us to walk through. It's a best case scenario for having contractors in your house everyday. When it comes to design they are fantastic, and helped us make decisions that really improved the look and feel of our space. We couldn't be happier with the final outcome!"
5,"We were very pleased with American Home Improvement Inc!  Our home needed foundation repair along the entire front of the house as well as replacement of the entry stairs which also meant rebuilding a portion of exterior wall and re stucco.  Benjamin was easy to deal with and did exactly what he said he would do.  The contract and payment schedule was clearly spelled out.  They started the job when they said, his workers showed up every day on time, cleaned up after themselves every day and they finished within a day or so of scheduled completion.  I was extremely impressed with how efficient and how well-calculated they were with their time and scheduling. They were attentive to our needs and always followed up with to make sure that we were happy.I would recommend to everyone."

My husband and I found them very easy to work with and very professional. We would recommend them to anyone looking to have their kitchen or bath remodeled."
5,"I needed to add a shower in my parents room and David and his crew came through.  David listened intently to my parents needs and offered creative and practical solutions to the limited space available.  For the shower addition, he was able to skillfully make it so one could roll a wheelchair right in, with no step at all.  A slight slope was made for wheelchair access and water drainage. David offered to assist me in choosing tile, fixtures, and grab bars for my parents.  They look beautiful.  He had to deal with many different personalities at my parents home and he was patient and professional through the whole job.  His crew was always prompt, friendly and cleaned up after themselves. He finished the job in just a few weeks. My parents are so happy with the finished project.  We would definitely use him again."
5,"Very pleased with our bathroom remodel!  They have done the job in no time, with careful cleanup when they were done. Installation then went forward with no delays, no waiting for materials or available crew. Nick helped with selection of beautifully coordinated tile, which was installed with meticulous attention to detail.  Excellent communications and supervision throughout the whole project.  And the price was reasonable.  We would hire them again for our future need and highly recommended Nick and AHM for your next construction!!"
5,Shawn and his guys did a unbelievable job on my bathroom. My bathroom was all were old tile from the 80's with a leaking shower. Now we have white marble with amazing borders. When I was searching for company's all the construction company's I contacted gave me a horrible vibe from the start. I decided to invite 2 contractors to my house and Shawn was one of them. He suggested different options on expanding my bathroom and changing the layout at an affordable price. I felt very comfortable with him and his crew during the job and feel very confident with the quality after. The premises was kept clean during the job which was agreed upon in our original meeting and the job was completed on a timely manner. I had mentioned to Shawn I've always wanted a rain shower so he decided it was a good idea to surprise me with one as we did not agree to it on the original contract. I owe it to this company for such professional and quality work. I recommend Shawn and his crew for any of your remodeling and/or construction projects.
5,"I will hire this company again. They did work for both my neighbors and they referred me them. They did my exterior painting, windows, bathroom vanity and tile. The job exceeded my expectation and the time of work was 2 weeks from start to end. I will be calling this company again"
5,I recently contacted 1oak remodeling through a friend as she just remodeled her kitchen. I also just went through a big renovation and was not in the mood for another one although I urgently needed to repair my driveway and landscape the front of my home. They set an appointment with me and guided me through all the steps and procedures. My job finished in 1 week!!! They had a full crew working everyday to make my dreams come true. This company is really 1 of a kind! Thank you for all your help!!
5,"Shawn from AHI did an excellent job.  I recently hired them to remodel my 80 year old Mother's bathroom.  My intention was to accommodate handicapped accessible usage to an older home.  Most contractors that I contacted prior to the remodel wanted to sell an elaborate over the top remodel to a room that I had already laid out with my ideas and intentions.  Those contractors that came out, came as a team and wanted to sign a on the spot 1 day only sale price, otherwise the price would go up.  After contacting them, I was listened to, told them what I wanted and they proposed a reasonable solution.  There was no pressure or ""sales"" attack.  Having dreaded doing a job like this while meeting with several shady contractors, I was pleasantly surprised with the fact that they took care of everything.  No surprises or additional charges, etc.  Just a competent, professional and thorough job from a very happy customer.  I would highly recommend Shawn and American Home Improvement your remodeling needs."
5,I awarded American Home Improvement Inc my Wiltshire home renovation and am very pleased with their service. Very clean crew and they are perfectionists!!! Love their work and their collaboration with my Designer. Thank you Jose!
5,"American Home Improvement in Los Angeles! They understands quality and good building practices. From start to finish their attention to detail is excellent. The work site is always well organized and clean. Michael did an outstanding job overseeing the construction project. I had a room addition built and completely renovated my entire house, including remodeling my kitchen and all four bathrooms. All of the workers were friendly and fantastic at their specific trade. They were easy to communicate with and made an effort to keep the site safe (I have a toddler). They came out, was very nice and Michael and his team was able to complete the remodeling in less than a month. All the materials were selected from his vendors and Michael was able to get us a nice discount. During the whole remodeling, Michael visited us often and informed us about the progress and any problem that came up and what solution can solve it. His honesty and professionalism proved itself during this work and we are thankful for that. I would recommend this contractor to anyone that values quality and detailed work!!!"
5,"I hired American Home Improvement Inc for a whole house remodel. We pretty much broke down all interior and exterior walls and reconfigured walls to create an open floor plan. I believe they have before and after photos on their profile, not sure if the photos are up yet but boy was it a transformation! Throughout the process, I learned so much about construction. Never realized how many tedious decisions are needed in order to remodel a house, starting with kitchen cabinets, counter tops, blinds, color of paint, floors, on and on and on. Overall it was a great project, and I would hire these guys to work for me again in a heartbeat. Most important thing to me is being able to stay true to my preset budget."
5,I had my house renovated by the and I loved the time I spent working with them. The staffs are very nice and open to any suggestions and accept the help if given. I had a great time with them and they did the job very good too. Definitely recommend them.

5,"Their crew is amazing. They did my kitchen and bathroom, and I couldn't have been happier with their job. They were very nice and friendly, they kept the workspace clean and organized which helped everyone in that situation move around the house with more comfort. They know how to make their customers happy and provide good servicing with their tools. Working with them has been awesome for me so I'll recommend them to anyone needing a remodeling."
5,I called them in for my home renovation and they sent someone to check things and give an estimate . The think i was more concerned about is if I would get the kind of look i want from them.

Their service is very good.I will definitely call American Home Improvement Inc if i want another redesign.

5,"I am very pleased with the work Done by Sibay, I hired this contractor to remodel the kitchen in my new home because I didn't have enough counter space and I bake a lot.

The contract was specific, the company had a payment schedule and they even helped me finance the project. The kitchen is just perfect for my baking needs now.

Only set back was that there was a door that was accidentally scratched when the counter tops where being installed but they fixed the door a few days later. My sister is hiring them also for her bathroom and I hope she has just the same experience as I did."
5,"Working with Shawn was great, after visiting their location and meeting the staff I felt very comfortable with my decision to remodel. The process wasn't always easy but Shawn made it easy for us to live in the home during construction. The workers were very polite and the projects were completed on time and I couldn't be happier."

I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a renovation."
5,"American Home Improvement did our bathroom remodel. This company deserves 6 stars if that was possible! I usually shop around before I make a choice. I can say in confidence that I can totally recommend them for either small or big jobs.  The crew were very professional, and on top of their work and especially their prices are very compatible.  They went above and beyond what they promise!"
5,"I can only say that American Home Improvement has been the greatest company in the field of construction in terms of no hassle. I appreciated everything about working with them. It was easy reaching out to them and speaking with a representative about my plans and estimates. The inspection where we over my remodel in detail and decided on a price was a friendly affair (considering the fairness of the price). Lastly, the project itself was finished one week ahead of schedule, and it was done beautifully! My family and I could not be happier with our new living room and kitchen."
5,"American Home Improvement remodeled my father's bathroom and it came out great.

I was also able to upgrade my electrical panel and will be having solar panels installed in the next few months."

5,"American Home Improvement designed my kitchen. I already worked with them and I knew that they are very trustworthy company. They did excellent job, completed on time and I am completely satisfied."
5,"We replaced all cabinetry, tile and fixtures for the entire bathroom including moving the tub and creating a new shower area. We had a leak under the previous cabinetry so there were also remediation work and lots of demo leading into the project. We hired them mainly because, unlike other contractors, they were full-service from the design end. Their mobile showroom really helps you make decisions, even on the minor details, and Eli helped us get ideas and ensure that our design choices would work together (for example making sure that all the plumbing fixtures were compatible). We also requested some unique features (like a rock river effect in the tile/grout leading from the shower to the bathroom door) that we had an idea for that resulted in a solution they helped design. The team was professional throughout and clearly worked together well. Work was done on time and within budget. The cleaning crew they had come in at the end was world class as well."
5,"This was the most amazing experience remodeling a kitchen that I think you could ask for!  Neev was incredible with the timeline, what to expect, when to expect it and even completed the project early!  It is a big undertaking to not have a kitchen for awhile and it was completely worth it!  The work is impeccable, I could always reach Neev and he was always willing to work with me or explain if I didn't understand what was happening next.  The best experience!"

Neev, the Senior Project Manager and Tal, the foreman, worked to keep me posted as the job progressed.  Any problems were solved to my satisfaction.  There were a few delays so the project took longer than expected but it looks great. The day to day trade workers were very respectful. professional and hard workers.  I would recommend this company to others planning a home renovation."
5,"I’m not one to typically post a review, but after our recent experience with American Home Improvement and specifically our project manager Neev Kugel, I felt obliged to comment on their phenomenal work.  We contracted them to remodel our kitchen as well as re-do the flooring in adjacent rooms and other related improvements.  I was extremely impressed by how professional Neev and the whole operation was from start to finish.  Outside of knowing we wanted to update our kitchen, my wife and I really didn’t have a clear vision on exactly how we wanted it to look.  We essentially put our faith and trust in Neev to deliver an end product that we would love and he didn’t disappoint.  At the start of the project, Neev brought in designers who were very knowledgeable, creative and receptive to our ideas to help create a contemporary and elegant design that both my wife and I loved.  From there, Neev developed the project plan and timeline that was consistent with the original estimate.  
Throughout the entire process, Neev was very communicative and would always clearly outline next steps so we knew what to expect.  This made the process much smoother and reduced the typical frustration that can come with remodels because we always knew the status of the work.  

Now this is not to say the project was completed without any snags.  As with any project, there were surprises that came up.  However, Neev always worked with us to explain the issue, outline our options, and would work with us to make sure we were happy with the final outcome. All of the workers brought into our home showed the same level of professionalism and quality craftsmanship.  Most importantly, the final outcome of the remodel was outstanding.  Not only was everything completed on-time and on-budget, but it turned out absolutely stunning exceeding our expectations.  And as the say, the devil is in the details, and it was the details where the quality of the work came through.  It was clear that they do not cut corners.  The quality of the work was beyond reproach.  

In terms of price, we didn’t do much comparison shopping before going with AHI.  Neev impressed us when we initially brought him in so we didn’t get other bids for the project.  I can say anecdotally the price was very comparable to what some of our other friends paid for similar work.  And most importantly the price originally agreed to is was we ultimately paid, which is very important to me.  No bait and switch.   

All in all, I would highly recommend Neev and AHI if considering a home improvement project."
5,Excellent home remodeling company. They recently remodeled our kitchen and we really are very satisfied with the outcome. Eli was our project manager and he was very helpful. He also resolved some issued and made a project very simple although it wasn't at all. They finished the kitchen within promised time and we are very impressed with their quality of work. Thank you American Home Improvement!
5,"American Home Improvement just completed our bathroom and patio remodel and we could not be happier. Neev Kugel was our project manager and he is an absolute gem. He made sure that we were informed every step of the way what to expect for the weekly schedule and always knew who was coming and going. His communication was excellent. He always got back to me, no matter how trivial my question or concern might have been.  As this was our first remodel, Neev helped us design, select and accent our remodel by leading us in the right direction. We absolutely love our tile and Neev provided a specific shopping list that allowed us autonomy to select our own designs, while helping us avoid unnecessary expenses. 

The crew of artisans Neev brought in to do the work were amazing. From the demolition crew to the tile guys, they were all professional and clean. They arrived on time and were courteous and helpful. They went out of their way to be sure we were happy with the results and had us view everything as it was completed to be sure we were satisfied. Anything that needed to be addressed was handled right away and to our complete satisfaction. 

As I said in the beginning, we could not be happier with the whole experience. Neev and his crew turned an old, outdated bathroom in to a serene and relaxing place to be. It turned out exactly as I wanted, as Neev understood my vision and guided us in the right direction. We would not have what we do today were it not for him."
5,"I can only say positive things about my experience with American Home Improvement. My remodel was performed above my expectations by a very qualified and talented design and remodeling team. 

They stayed on track during the kitchen remodel and provided favorable results. My kitchen turned out exactly as my wife and I envisioned. My family loves it and spends more time in the kitchen now as a result of the beautiful design."
5,"American Home Improvement has been phenomenal to work with. They lay out what your project will consist of at the start, so there are no surprises when the project is taking place. Their designers are skilled and experienced and also patient enough to listen to the input of the customer. 

This made me feel like I had involvement in the project that wasn’t overly stressful. Being a part of the creative process added to the experience. They ended up finalizing the kitchen remodel in just 3 weeks as we agreed on. This was an above average remodeling experience that consisted of everything I recommend others look for when doing business with a contractor. Transparency, professionalism, and timeliness."
5,"I had many issues with my roof if recent time and I thought it was time to replace it. I already worked with American Home Improvement so I called them to send someone to inspect my roof. They agreed it was time to replace it and gave me several solutions. I accepted one of them and they were available soon. The crew came early in the morning on scheduled time, they worked hard and they were very quick because they are so well organized. The installation went OK, there were some issues but it was resolved easily. My new roof looks amazing thanks to American Home Improvement!!"

5,"American Home Improvement has done their part throughout this bathroom remodeling project. I never felt like I needed to chase them down to get my questions answered or to fulfill their general timeline for completion. 

Everything in the project was fluent, down to the expectations that were established by everyone involved. Designers, managers, owners, etc. Everyone fulfilled their roles in a professional manner and that’s why our bathroom has the marble finish we’ve always yearned for.

Best,
Maura"

We spoke to several companies and we came across American Home Improvement. We loved the fact that they are having multiple offices and that in our initial meeting, we were able to get all the answers for our questions and the ideas that could improve our house. Or, is a great communicator person and he has a good amount of knowledge when it comes to remodeling and design. He met with us several times and he also was able to give us a price that was very comparable to the other ones we got. The work started with the removal of the wall and it continued from there to the kitchen. Overall we are very happy with the new kitchen and mainly with the open space that we have now at our house."

Her guys installed stone tiles on the half walls surrounding the bathroom. The paint that I selected was dark brown and it blended perfectly with the rest of the theme that she did for me. The other bathroom was bigger and included a shower as well with a shower system. They worked pretty fast and the work was completed after 1 month. I was happy with the communication skills that Tammy have and it shows how professional person she is."
5,"We hired Tammy at American Home Improvement for a large remodeling project. The remodeling project that she did for us was to replace the entire roof at our house and then to remodel completely the kitchen and master bathroom. Tammy worked on the 3 sections of the house at the same time with several team of people that each one was a professional one at his trades. The old roof was an old one and once the old roof was removed, the roofing team started to install the new one under the supervision of Tammy. Inside the house, we had another team of people that worked on the kitchen and master bathroom. At the end of the kitchen demolition, Tammy noticed a large mold behind the sink cabinets. Tammy was able to immediately inspect it and she provided us with an advice on what to do. As soon as that problem was solved, the rest of the remodeling project went very smoothly and without any issues. The remodeling was finished pretty fast due to the fact that all the people that worked at our house, worked on a daily basis and Tammy visited the house each day and made sure that everything is going according to the plan. American Home Improvement did remarkable remodeling job on the roof, kitchen and master bathroom. More than that, she helped us to get the great deals for all the appliances and finishing hardware for our house."

They finished kitchen in 6 weeks and the price was same as estimate. I didn't expected that because they were some issues which they resolved with success. The kitchen looks beautiful, my wife love it and that is most important!"
5,"decided to remodel my bathroom. I had to have my bathroom done a specific way, because I've always had a vision of ""the perfect bathroom"".

He was very happy with the work that they did and he recommend them to anyone he knows that looking for a contractor regarding to any remodeling project. The bathroom that they did at my house have a complete new look and is now more functional and easy to use. While they were working, I noticed how clean, neat, pleasant to talk to and helpful.

Or was able to provide original and reasonable results while keeping it on budget."
5,"They did great job. I needed to remodel bathroom and I already worked with this contractor on my previous home so I had great experience with them. The quality materials they used were over all my expectations for the price they offered and project was finished on time. Bathroom looks magnificent, thank you American Home Improvement!"
5,"I had wonderful experience with American home improvement. They did garage and basement remodel for me. The whole project lasted 6 weeks and they did excellent job. Eddie was always there when needed, answered all our question, gave us some good ideas and resolved some issues. The whole project didn't cost a dollar more than estimate which wasn't case with some other companies we hired in the past. We are very satisfied with garage and basement and will highly recommend American Home Improvement to friends, family, neighbors"
5,This is my second remodeling and first time I wasn't completely satisfied so this time I decided to pick up carefully right contractor for my kitchen remodel. I contacted 5 or 6 contractors and deccided to give job to American Home Improvement because their project was closest to my ideal kitchen. When they started work they were very professional and kept eye on details and always updated with new info about work progress. The work was done 2 days before they said It will be done and within budget. The kitchen looks better than I expected and I will definitelly recommend American Home Improvement.
5,I was provided with excellent immediate service from the call I placed to the very end of the work. I first dealt with David and he was very informative. He sent Shawn & right away I was comfortable and confident that this was the company for me. The workers were polite & professional and did an amazing job. Will definitely use them again for my future projects. Thank you American Home Improvement
5,I recently hired American Home Improvement for my kitchen remodel. The American Home Improvement staff treated me as if I was their most important client and their whole team pitched in to help when needed. The remodel was finished on-time and on-budget and I couldn't be happier with the work done and the service I received.
5,"The quality of work is outstanding. Eddie, the crew leader is amazing. His work is perfect, and he keeps you in the loop the entire time making sure every single aspect of the job is exactly how you want it to be. He takes no shortcuts and is honest and caring. We ended up with the kitchen of our dreams and I cannot thank American Home Improvement enough. I wouldn't have wanted anything to go differently. I would recommend this contractor to anyone looking for a kitchen remodel"
5,"merican Home Improvement did complete makeover of my garage.Shawn did great job, he was very helpful and very carefull to make sure everything will fit perfectly. We hired them because the job estimate came in significantly lower than the other 2 estimates we received and the other guys simply didn't seem as motivated to take us on. They finished job in 6 days with no extra costs. Our garage looks great and We highly recommend American Home Improvement!"
5,"We worked with American Home Improvement to do our kitchen remodel.

We could not be any happier with our new bathroom and we highly recommend working with American Home Improvement."

At the end I only can tell that our bathroom looks amazing and will highly recommend this contractor."

They completed job in 5 days like they said it will be done and everything was done excellent, the floor, painting, cabinets. They left clean place after they finished project. Thanks I will recommend to my friends and family"
5,The American Home improvement was one of 4 other contractors we've contacted and by far they were the most competitive. They did absolutely amazing work. The whole American Home Improvement team were professional and easy to work with. They installed laminate in our two rooms and they looks so much better now. I highly recommend anyone looking for a home remodel to contact them first.
1,"Do not trust this company.  The project started out well but quickly became a nightmare. This large company hires out contractors to get work and doesn't seem to check these contractors experience.  The guy that I learned later was a great salesman, but didn't know how to create a simple footing.  I had to correct his formwork! Then after he promised to prove himself, he failed again and the rebar was all wrong.
 I asked AHI for a new contractor.  They agreed and would keep promising to fix the same issue. 4 different people were sent out over 3 weeks and each one didn't speak to the previous one and knew nothing about the project. They all agreed that the work by the first contractor was not correct, but each crew also contradicted each other. It's like they didn't even know who came out before and I would have to explain what is going on.
 AHI would promise again and again to correct the issue and each time they failed. I have worked in the construction industry on large and small projects for over 10+ years.  I have never experienced any company with such a lack of communication and incompetence.  DO NOT HIRE AHI."
5,"WONDERFUL KITCHEN REMODEL  AHI is an excellent company that strives to fully satisfy. Met with Eli and unlike other companies, AHI was the only company that truly listened to my desires and made sure to explain all possible options and limitations that could lie ahead. They have a trustworthy, courteous and hardworking group of craftsman. Eli was there throughout the job progress. The end was everything and more than I was hoping for. While they were not the cheapest price wise - although was very reasonable, the cost is worth it in the end. You made my family very happy and proud of our new kitchen. Thank you!"
5,"Thank God for a great company. Nick came out & they did a complete redesign/renovation of our home (aprox 3000 sq ft.). Amazing attention to detail and incredibly responsive. Aside from a couple of minor hiccups (all projects of this scale will have some), they far exceeded all of our expectations and would immediately turn to them if we were to have any additional renovation needs. These guys are full service -- from creating the design to following through in making it exactly as it was planned. Everyone at this company, from the person answering the phone to the owners care and work hard to make one's renovations go smoothly."
5,"My new kitchen was remodeled and supervised by American home improvement under Elad. Elad designed and implemented the kitchen by generating a 3D design for the kitchen, providing me with several options of styles, colors and appliances. After several meetings that I had with him, I was able to come up with a design and style that I liked and Elad took care of the rest. My remodeling was hassle free because Elad was able to place the orders, making sure that everything will be delivered to my house so the remodeling will not be delayed or effected by missing any of the items/materials. Elad was nice to me and he always answered my calls or returned them within a reasonable time period. I highly recommend this company. The new kitchen came out excellent and exactly the way it should be."
5,"We truly love American home improvement! We had a wonderful time during the remodeling work that they did at our house and we highly recommend this company! Mark was able to deliver everything he promise and even more. We originally hired them to completely redo the kitchen and bathroom on top of few other tasks around the house. One of our friend is an interior designer by profession and she joined us and helped on the design of our new stunning kitchen, brand new cabinets, new hardware, paint, counter tops and more. Mark and his team were able to join forces very well with her and we were happy by that because it saved us money. In the master bedroom and bathroom we removed the existing tub and installed new hot tub including the replacement of all the existing floors and walls in addition to replacing all the light fixtures and the vanity mirrors. We fell that we are very blessed by having American home improvement and that the remodeling project was completed right before the holidays. We are currently thinking of doing another project and of course we will hire American home improvement! We are very satisfied with all the people at American home improvement that were involved at our house project that we invited all of them for a BBQ after the job was done."
5,"American home improvement remodeled completely our kitchen and laundry room and it came out gorgeously. We found American home improvement through online website. We wanted to upgrade and renew the kitchen we had because it was old style and needed to be more functional so we used American home improvement for that and the kitchen is now more than what we wanted. We are very fascinated with the precision of the cabinets, countertops and paint (on top of the other parts of the work). Isaac made sure that everything will be without any mistake or error. They were very professional & hardworking people. All the communication could not been better between us to Isaac to the labor crew. The overall experience in this project was great and pleasant. Isaac was the best project manager. He kept us in the constant loop and made sure that all of our concerns will be addressed. Very detailed oriented and high communication skills person. We definitely consider working again with Isaac & American home improvement!"
5,"We hired American home improvement for our entire house remodeling. We recently purchased this house and it was in an immediate updates. Our supervisor was Isaac which during the whole work was very reliable, hardworking person, always available, quickly respond our calls or messages. Like any other remodeling project, we came across several problems which we thought will increase the overall budget BUT Isaac took care of them right away. His team, were all wonderful and we have no complain against any of them! They worked hard and fast while making sure that everything works and come out great. We truly know that other contractors (in case we hired them for that job) might do it cheaper, but the quality of the work that Isaac did – can’t be compared at all. Now our house is back to life and looks brand new. Thank you Isaac and the wonderful team!"
5,"I hired American Home Improvement for the remodeling project of my master closet, master bathroom and mainly the kitchen. I had my vision of how I want them to be done and more than that, I was able to design my drawings of the spaces and I just needed someone reliable that can make it happen. I spoke to few contractors and met with them too. One of them was Mickey. Mickey was very nice, professional and skilled contractor when we met and he captured my attention compare to the other ones. The remodeling supposed to be finish within a month of work but due to several changes that we did during the work, it ended up that the remodeling took a little longer than it should but at the end…. I can say clearly that it was well worth it! I must mention also, that Mickey didn’t charge me anything more what we agreed on and he was very fair and honest while the quality of the work and the customer service was beyond compare."
5,"American home improvement has completed several projects in our house including the remodeling of our guest bathroom, master bathroom, kitchen and living room area. The design and remodeling was a custom European style/modern while the bathroom included a walk in tile shower, jet shower system, home automation and more… part of the design was to reposition the door opening for a much better use of space. American home improvement staff helped us by selecting all of the finish materials including the tiles, upper and lower cabinets, accessories and more… including the color/style of the paint. David included also in his work the remodeling of the guest bathroom, drywall, type of texture, baseboards etc. He has excellent, professional craftsmanship and creativity skills. American home improvements approach and talent to meet our deadlines were fantastic and he was able to finish the remodeling project on time. We definitely recommend American home improvement and all the involved people that worked at our house for any type or style of construction or remodeling projects. We are very pleased with the completed project and we will hire them again for more upcoming projects. Thanks American home improvement for a great job from a very happy customer."
5,"American Home Improvement and our project manager, Elad, have done a gorgeous remodeling job on our open space concept kitchen remodeling. We must admit that we are not easy clients! As part of our remodeling project, we removed several load bearing walls and installed new beams within the ceiling, poured concrete footings under the house, installed new hardwood floors from the living room into the kitchen and matched the drywall on the walls and ceiling in order to achieve a perfectly flat client and everything went smoothly. During the work, we lived at the house and the workers sealed off all the spaces that were not part of the work so the dust that we were so concerned of… was kept to minimum. Elad also made sure to stick to the main budget and the promised timeline (which was very important to us). We were warned by some friends that these days it’s very hard to find a good company that will provide the same service as we got from American Home Improvement! We are looking forward to hire them for additional projects in the future!"
5,"We had several meetings with Shean from American home improvement regarding to the kitchen that we want to remodel and what is our vision and goals. After he heard our thoughts, requests and fears, he came up with an incredible, open space kitchen and dining room area that came out much more stunning than we imagined. Not only does our new space look spectacular, it’s unique and very functional. Remarkably, Shean and all the people that were involved in our remodeling project, were professionals, hard-working people who really showed us that they care and treated it like it was their own home. The general attitude of American home improvement’s was very positive and impressive this is the main reason why we are writing this review and we highly recommend them."
5,"If we summarized our remodeling project, we will say that Daniel is the person that you will want to manage your remodeling project!!!!! we can’t write enough about his personality and working crew. They are all absolute professionals. Everything was performed within the time frame we agreed on and with the highest remodeling standards. Our brand new kitchen looks perfect! The crew was very polite, skilled and worked very hard to get the remodeling project done to our satisfaction. Daniel was in contact with all the relevant updates regards the remodeling and he was there for us most of the time to answer any questions we had. His ideas really made a huge impact in the way the kitchen came out. His skills and vision made this work so easy. The new kitchen is now the main place where we usually spend most of our time. We couldn’t be happier and pleased. We currently have more plans on remodeling additional sections at the house and we won’t call anyone else – that’s for sure."
5,"We hired Shean and his professional workers to remodel our master bathroom. The complete preparation of the bathroom space was great, easy and they made sure to cover everything to prevent all the dust to come out and make a mess. The old bathroom was taken down all the way to the studs while right after that, they took care of replacing all the plumbing and electrical so they will be replaced with new ones and being upgraded. The inside walls were replaced as well, new tile floor have been installed and the bathroom got new fresh paint. After all of that was completed, Shean start to install the new tub, and then the floor was grouted and polished. The double sink vanity and all the relevant hardware such as sinks, faucets, handles etc.… were installed as well including all the baseboards. I must mention that their skills, involvement, approach and ability to achieve the goals & stay within the budgets while working with other sub-contractors was outstanding. The finished project is beautiful and perfect. We would highly recommend this company, as well as Shean and his crew."
5,"I hired American home improvement to re-do my entire house that I recently purchased and planned to live in. I hired American home improvement to design and implement the construction of the Kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, hallways, front yard and back yard. Shean was the main people that I worked with and after several meetings and conversations about what I want to get, they were able to come up with the draft design that included everything I wanted and it fit my style and budget. The draft design was polished and finalized and I gave the approval for the work to start. They were very flex with the entire remodeling project and they even did several changes that came up during the work and they didn’t charge me for them. Any bump that appeared during the construction, the entire team was on top of it and they were able to find the right solution that worked out very well and they took the required measures to remedy the situation to my satisfaction. The team including Shean was very responsive to any of my phone calls, e-mails and even text messages and the working crew were skilled and courteous. I would recommend them to anyone!"
5,"""Exceptional, skilled, superb craftsmanship"" are just the little good words that we can write here that can define our experience with American home improvement. Right after we interviewed 4 other construction companies, we knew that Adam was the only one that we should hire to remodel our two bathrooms and kitchen. Adam was honest with us from the beginning, proved to be truly hardworking, on time and that his main focus was to leave this remodeling project within our budget. His whole working crew was clean and very skilled as well. Adam was in constant communication with us during the whole remodeling process and he kept up in the loop in regards to anything that was involved with the work. Adam made sure to visit our house daily while making sure that he is satisfied with the progress and mainly that we love the work that they do. Their final work shows how we were correct about hiring them for our house and it came out so beautiful and mainly functional. We highly recommend American home improvement!"
5,"American home improvement was recommended to us by one of our close friends, the American home improvement team were very skilled and hardworking people. Daniel is a skilled contractor and designer who give 100% of himself in order to achieve the very best of work. Our project included the kitchen and master bedroom and bathroom and was managed by Daniel while executing by his team. The entire remodeling is a huge success and we are very happy with the results of how it came out. Each time we walk and use our new kitchen, we totally amazed and happy. The same feeling we have for the rest of the remodeling as well. Everything in the work including the painting, new insulation, woodworking, cabinets etc… are in perfect final results. In regards to the communication and reports – Daniel made sure to keep us in the loop in regards to anything involved with the work. We are very happy."
5,"Over the years, our house has suffered from some abuse from our kids and dogs. It was about time to do some upgrades and renovations to bring new life to the house. We wanted to do a complete remodeling and we start our searching for a designer and home improvement contractor. Our search brought us to American home improvement and we made an appointment with Or for an in house consultation. Almost right away we knew that he will be the one that will do the work. He spent with us over 3 hours browsing our house and asking many questions about what we were looking for to get in the remodeling. At the first meeting he came up with great ideas and few solutions as how to transform our home into a gorgeous and functional place to live. After several meetings with Or and his designer, our process of remodeling started. All our neighbors said how courteous & considerate the people at American home improvement were. We could see how the American home improvement crew were skilled and exhibited a great sense of craftsmanship and attention to details. It was clear how they took pride in what they were building. Or is not only extremely creative and skilled… but very detail oriented person and he asked the same from his people. Both Or and his crew delivered much more than they promised. If something was not 100% good, Or had it redone. He went above and beyond his words to make sure we were happy. The final results are a gorgeous statement of pride, craftsmanship and promises kept. We will continue to recommend American home improvement to anyone who asks. Thank you Or and your team too. If ever we need to do this again it would be our pleasure to have American home improvement."
5,"The guys at American home improvement were wonderful, we got from them the best deal for our remodeling project and we are very happy with how it came out. We wanted to be to remove two walls that we had in the middle of the room. After we got several estimates from 4 other companies, we decided to reject all of them for various reasons and to hire American home improvement for it. Sam came over to our house several times before the work was even started. He wanted to make sure that the design will represent exactly what we wanted to have and more than that, was the price. After we loved the design and the price, Sam started the work and it went very smoothly and without any problem. Sofia at the office, made sure that all the required paperwork will be done correctly and that we won’t have any delay with the progress. We truly love the new kitchen that Sam did for us and we highly recommend them to anyone."
5,"American home improvement did several sections at my house including the remodeling of my master bathroom, 2 Additional bathrooms and paint the entire house. The whole work turned out to an amazin results. Or was the main person that I dealt with and he was amazingly easy person to work with. His in-house designer made so many great design solutions and ideas while placing all of my needs and vision into the final budget. The entire work was done by skilled and professional people who made extra attention on cleaning and productivity. During the work, there was never a mess and each day and before everyone left for the day, the workers made sure to dedicate and hour or so for organize the working space and the following morning when they came to work, they will set up tarps and covers on all the floors and areas. The bathrooms were a complete remodeling tasks where they removed everything and rebuild it based on the new design. The new design gave us a huge shower space (after removing the bath tub) with glass enclosure, a normal size bench and awesome floors and walls tile work. I’m very happy with the work and would recommend them for any remodeling project."
5,"I called American home improvement after my massive research about their services and I was very pleased with what I read and saw. After I spoke to the representative, I asked them to schedule an appointment with and to discuss my project and to see what I can do. To my house arrived Shean and went over me about the kitchen and living room remodeling project and after 2 additional meetings, the work started. I will not go into all the micro details here, but I was very happy and surprised with the quality of the work and mainly how they managed everything. American home improvement are by far the most professional company I have ever got involved with and it was clear during each and every stage of the way. I do recommend them for any type of remodeling project such as upgrading, new construction or any other type of construction work."
5,"We wanted to remodel our Kitchen completely on top of the remodeling of the main floor (paint and new floor). One family member of us recommended that we should talk to Ziv at American home improvement before making any decision with the other contractors. After speaking with Ziv, it was pretty clear to us that we should hire them for that work and to leave the other contractors. Ziv gave us a perfect direction and ideas about the remodeling and we were very happy with that because we knew that this is what we need and want. Ziv and his team were extremely detailed oriented people and they surpassed all the anticipations with the finished kitchen. Each day we saw how our remodeling project is moving forward and how friendly and hardworking people the team were. Unlike past experiences… We didn’t have to worry if the workers will show up each morning to work. The American home improvement working people were on top of our remodeling project and we can’t thank them enough. We do recommend them!!!"
5,"I hired American home improvement to finally bring the backyard of my house to life. The empty lot in the back yard was the same way I got it when I purchased the new house from the builder and all it had was just dirt. This project was pretty challenging because of the semi small space, shaped and slightly irregular. American home improvement was able to provide me with several estimates and options and all of this in order to help me get the ‘feeling’ of prices based on several levels of items and quality in hard-scape, soft-scape and lighting. This method of service allowed me to make better choices on areas to enhance or compromise in order to stay within budget. My past experiences with landscapers was not good and it made it harder for me to make a decision in hiring anyone to this project. My past experience showed me that whoever you hire, they will be either good at one thing or not that good at the other one, rarely can you find someone that will be goo in both AND mostly they never finish anything when they say they're going to. My experience with American home improvement was completely different and positive. Ben was especially knowledgeable about both hard and soft-scape and provided intuitively good recommendations. Sure thing but like any job, there will always be few problems, but Ben was fair enough and responsive, working diligently to come to a resolution we were both happy with. I was most impressed with the professionalism and hardworking ethic of the actual crew that did the work. They arrived on time every day, were polite and cleaned up after themselves each day. They take pride in their work and it shows. American home improvement did such a good job. I will hire them again for any future landscaping needs."
5,"Based on several recommendations and help from friends about this company, I decided to go ahead and hire American home improvement to remodel my 2 bathrooms and kitchen. During each one of the steps in the remodIsaacng, Isaac (the owner) informed me and communicate with me about what is happening , what is going to happened and he always responded to my emails, calls or even texts and my feedback about some of the things that the workers did that day or about to do. The teams at American home improvement that worked at my house, did a great job as well and they put a lot of attention in order to make everything in perfect condition and without mistakes, thanks to Juan and all of the others.  Even when there were issues or concerns from my end, Isaac and the workers were always willing to make it right or to explain to me why it needed to be that way. Isaac and Jacob (his partner) were very helpful and have even provided advice and assistance on other construction issues unrelated to their work. I would not hesitate to recommend American home improvement for any large construction jobs and will definitely be using them again whenever I have another project."
5,Finding a contractor for me was the most stressful part of the remodeling. I have contacted a lot of companies knowing I will be investing on my savings. I can never seem to find a company I can trust & I just couldn’t click with their reps until I found American Home Improvement. My project manager asked the right questions & I felt that what really mattered was for me to get what I want for the price I can afford. He made sure we stay within the budget & what was more important was that he delivered from beginning to end. I was not disappointed at all. Highly recommend this company.
5,"My experience with AHI couldn’t be any better. With a little hesitation because of budget issues, I called this company from a local
Magazine for an estimate. I was very impressed how knowledgeable the project manager was. He gave me different options & ideas & helped me from A to Z get a loan with the terms I can be comfortable with to actually do the outdoor remodeling I’ve always wanted. Now I have a brand new patio & a backyard done very professionally. I am very pleased with my experience & will certainly call them for my next home project."
5,"My home is over 10 years old and we finally decided to do a kitchen update. I hired American home improvement to design and implement the new kitchen and make it practical for us. Isaac came up with a great design of the kitchen and he actually took the time to listen to us and to truly understand our needs. Isaac and his workers on top of his sub-contractors, worked together in a professional manner to deliver the kitchen I wanted and the result are wonderful. His crew were always on time and I was overwhelmed with the schedule and the daily tasks routine they had and mostly the cleaning at the end of each day. When the remodeling was completed, I noticed of several problems. I called Isaac at American home improvement and he came out right away and fixed them all. We are now thinking of hiring them again to remodel the bathrooms at our house."
5,"I highly recommend American home improvement to for any quality of home remodeling and dealing with creative, professionals and skilled people. I wanted add an additional space to my bedroom that will have a powder room and a larger bathroom in my house. I came to American home improvement with a global concept of what I wanted to achieve. Shlomo worked with me hand by hand to make the addition and to enlarge the bathroom and to recreate the closet space while remodeling the bathroom and powder room the way I wanted it to be. I trusted the working team from the very early stage of the work but the completed remodeling project is much more beautiful than what I had anticipated! Shlomo did a great work by redesigning and polished the original design (master bathroom and powder room) that feel large, relaxed and lovely. The crew that executed this remodeling was excellent as well. Even our guests and family stated on how enjoyable and trained they were! The work took a little longer than it should (which is normal to my opinion) but Shlomo communicated with me often and provided me with weekly updates and detailed explanations of the work progress and what left to be done. I am hoping to remodel the kitchen in the near future and I’m looking forward to hire American home improvement again."
5,"We had a great pleasure to hire and allow American home improvement to work at our house and Mae and the workers for the recent kitchen and guest bathroom remodeling. I write this review based on our experience only of hiring them. Mickey and Mae did a great job at the kitchen mainly and Mae made it go easy and smoothly. The main points according to our experience with them were:
1. Very well organized company and structured. The workers and Mickey showed up to the house each day during the week and they arrived on time and on the little times that they didn’t show up due to things such as deliveries etc.…  they always gave us notice ahead of time which was important. 
2. All the communication between the office (Mae), Mickey and the workers were excellent. They didn't make any mistakes and were able to do everything in good and professional manner. We expected to have some errors and delays but I we were just lucky and we didn’t have any. 
3. Price wise - They were a bit more expensive than the other bids we received but the effort and care they put into our project was well worth it. Sometimes you just have to go with your instinct and choosing with them was one of the best decisions we made."
5,"We got in touch with American home improvement about doing several things at our house. We wanted to have them paint the house, replace the windows with a double sided glass and add 2 patio doors that will give us a bigger opening space from the house to the back yard and to rebuilt the kitchen. We wanted to replace the faces of the kitchen cabinet doors and to give it a new look while keeping the existing layout of it. Isaac was able to provide us with the best deal and our research about the company gave us the final approve to hire them. While we worked on the kitchen with Isaac and his people, we decided to do additional things at the house that we thought it will be a good idea to do them while we do the kitchen project as well. The windows that we Isaac replace for us were a double glass windows with special film (UV film). In the patio, we wanted to have bigger opening that will allow us to be inside the house while getting the feeling of being outside. Isaac's people did a perfect job on that too. The last item that we did was to paint the house inside and also some touch ups outside. Isaac brought to the house several people that came over and worked area by area and making sure that we can live at the rest of the house. The work came out better than we thought and we are extremely pleased with our decision to hire American home improvement and mainly to work with Isaac."
5,"Many thanks to American Home Improvement and mainly Mark and the actual people that were involved in our remodeling, for the excellent remodeling job that they did at our house. The remodeling project included the full remodeling of our house and it included the kitchen. Bathrooms, back yard, front yard, bedrooms and hallways. The work changed completely the house and we love it very much! Mark and his crew did such a professional work and each part of it was done with extra care and attention. During the work and even after, Mark was there for us to answer any of our questions or concerns, meeting us at various vendors and helped us selecting and choosing all the materials, appliances and paint. He used his skills and experience to advise us on all the many available options for many issues that raised during the work! We would refer American Home Improvement to anyone looking to convert their house space into something stunning!"
5,"Shlomo did a wonderful job when we hired him and his people to renovate our house. We hired him to execute our designed plans that we did with another design firm. The design plans were to remodel our kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms, laundry room and living room on top of the dining room area as well. Shlomo at American Home Improvement and their several subcontractors that were hired for our remodeling in order to do the electricity, plumbing and custom kitchen cabinets, were able to bring the design to life with an amazing skills and special attention to all the small details which made this remodeling project a huge success and very beautiful. During the work, we noticed very clear how the working crew and the subcontractors were easygoing and skilled with several modifications that came up due to unknown problems that arises during the work and all of them were communicating with us when they happen. We look forward to working with them again in the future."
5,"We were having Shlomo working at our house for the remodeling project that we needed to do for a while now. He met and sat with us several times of different days planning and describing their process and services. Our remodeling project was to do a new kitchen, master bathroom, master bedroom walk-in closet and replacing the old HVAC system with new one. Shlomo and Ben managed our project together and they started with measuring the existing areas of the house which allow them to come up with a design a week after. Each detail of the project was analyzed and discussed to mainly cover the cost and time frame for each task such as: appliances, countertops, cabinet style and colors etc. and the time frame that required for installing the new HVAC system from their sub-contractor. While close to half of the house was under work, American home improvement took every protection they could to cover the rest of the house from the dust and debris so we can live at the house for the time been and they made us a temporary kitchen. Each detail and part of the remodeling was supervised by both of them. The working team were very professional and skilled, from the electrician, the plumber, tile man and the painter. They all worked flawlessly together and involved us with each step of the work. Each one of them took pride in his own trade which ended in a beautiful kitchen and bathrooms that we enjoy just by looking at them. American home improvement finished our remodeling project on time and a little bit below our agreed budget and we look forward to hire them again. We highly recommend American home improvement to anyone considering a remodel."
5,"We recently worked with Shlomo to paint my house inside and out. I purchased this house recently and the house needed to get a fresh look and makeover. Shlomo came by the house several times in order to define each space at the house for any color combination and texture in the common areas. What I loved about her was that she was able to get a great idea of what needed to be done. The color combinations and textures, were so impressive and beautiful that the samples of them could prove that immediately. From all the samples that she was able to do with her painters, it was super easy to imagine how it will look like and the process was very easy. In the outside of the house, her color combinations made the same effect and this was the killer point that caused me to hire her and the team of painters from American home improvement. One of the main problems that I had, was all the furniture and items that I had at the house. Shlomo was able to solve that immediately by assigning 3 people that came to the house prior to the painters and they moved all the furniture and cover them so it will be ready for the painters to do the actual paint. The whole work went smoothly and without any problem which made me very happy and proud at myself that I hired the right company for the job. I felt that Shlomo really understood my style and she did all she could to make this on the easiest way and with completely perfection. She really listened to what I was looking for and saved me a lot of time and stress. If I wasn’t hired Shlomo or contact American home improvement, I'm sure I would still be not able to find any other paint company that could make my house this way."
5,"We hired Daniel from American home improvement to paint the exterior of our home after using another painting company painted the interior of our home, which we were not satisfied with. During our meetings with Daniel and with his senior painter, we felt that he was honest, professional and really easy to communicate with. Daniel showed us his past homes he'd done in the past, which were amazing, but he was also open to our new ideas (that we saw or got from other places and magazines). When you are getting bids for exterior painting, you want people who are open to jobs that are creative and maybe a little more time consuming, but stunning when completed. That is exactly how Daniel is; he's allows you the time to walk the property and visualize what it could look like. He listens to you and actually paints things the way you want. Besides having a wealth of experience and knowledge, he is considerate of how a person feels about their home. He recognizes that to the buyer of services, the outcome of the services mean something to the homeowners. That's a very rare thing to find. He gave us a great quote and an excellent timeframe, and he stuck to it; even when he pointed out to us that we might consider a darker shade around our windows (that he had already painted!). In the end, we loved the paint colors and the way he made our house the most beautiful on the block. He was so easy to work with, he kept his word on everything we agreed on, and he showed up every day, on time!! His professionalism is unparalleled as far as I'm concerned. My neighbors noticed too; they had Daniel paint their houses as well! I am more than happy to recommend Daniel's work to anyone who is interested in having their home or business done. He is awesome!"
5,"We just finished our kitchen remodeling project and we have to write here that American home improvement did a great job and they beat our anticipations! While we were seating and talking about the technical aspects of the remodeling, David (our project manager) told us that the project will take anytime between 1.5 moths to 2 months at most and during that time, the workers and the sub-contractors will work on a daily basis making sure that everything will be done. Our expectations regarding the remodeling was that it will pass that time because they had to do so much and we thought that this time will not be enough. In fact, the workers did came each day to the house and they arrived on time while working very hard. The remodeling was completed in exactly a month and 5 days! We still cannot believe how they could finish it in such period of time, and in a great results. This great experience insured them that we will hire them again in the future for any additional work that we might do and we will never hire someone else other than American home improvement because they are skilled, professional and they do care about the satisfaction of their customers while focusing on what the client want before offering anything. We do recommend them to whoever needs any remodeling for their house or office."
5,"My mom asked me to help her find a contractor to remodel her bathroom & after seeing at least 5 contractors I decided to go with American home improvement. For one, they were the only company who I felt that was sincere to my moms needs & my gut feeling was right. My mom did not have any unpleasant experience throughout the whole ordeal. The workers were great & respectful & did a great job. Most of all she loves her new bathroom. She's considering on doing her kitchen sometime soon & she will definitely use them again."
5,"Shlomo was the American home improvement project manager for the recent kitchen and bathroom renovation that we recently did and his team of skilled and hardworking did a wonderful job. We greatly recommend American home improvement and mainly Mike, The working crew and the office staff that was involved in our project and we will hire them again for any additional remodeling project in our house. Shlomo was the project manager on both remodeling projects (kitchen and bathroom), did a perfect designing job for the kitchen space by using most of the existing space with features that we needed and wanted for a while now. From start to end, the extra attention that Shlomo put to all the details of both projects was more than what we were looking for. He always gave wonderful ideas and suggestions and he made sure that we are happy with all the decisions about both renovations. We love both projects very much! The kitchen and the bathroom got a completely brand new look and they are very functional for our needs. It makes us very happy each time any of us walk into any of them!"
5,"American home improvement and Daniel, did a great job by remodeling our bathroom. The group of workers came to our house every morning, on time and stayed till they were able to finish the work scheduled for that day. They completed what Daniel planned for them to do for that day and then they came back the following morning to continue the work under the supervision of Daniel. All the people that were involved in our project, were hardworking people and they were always on top of things even when issues came up – they were able to solve them while keeping the budget. The bathroom remodeling project was finished on the time frame that Daniel gave us before we hired him. 
We met and talked to Daniel few times before we made our final decision and that was because we wanted to be sure that we got the best deal and that they will be able to finish the work without any problem. Daniel was very nice to us and he was very easy person to work with. He explained us everything that was belong to the project and he was very pleasant man to talk to. We are very happy with Tibi home remodeling and if we ever decide on doing another remodeling project we would definitely hire them again."
5,"After four estimates I decided to hire American home improvement to do my kitchen remodeling. Isaac from American home improvement, came over to our house for the first scheduled meeting that we arranged with the office and he was very experienced with the process of the kitchen remodeling and he was able to answer each one of the questions we had. For the second meeting, He showed up and he brought a 3D design of how the new kitchen will look like which it was exactly the way we wanted our kitchen to look like after the remodeling project will be over. Isaac was also great when it came to the estimate because he gave us a realistic quote for the work and during the work, it was so easy to communicate with him by phone, text of via the office. When it come to the way they worked, we must admit that we are satisfied with that too because they at the end of each day, they kept the kitchen space clean and they used all kind of protection materials to keep all the dust and debris separate from the rest of the living spaces of the house during the whole construction so the house won’t get messy and dirty. We didn’t have to keep informing them about it and that showed us how they really care about us. Very reliable company, we will definitely use them again."
5,"American home improvement is definitely a top quality landscape and hardscape Construction Company and I highly recommend them for everyone that is interesting in a high quality & qualified landscape work. We met Daniel for the first time last year after we purchased our first house in LA area. We were impressed by his amount of understanding, expertise and sense of concept. He understood right away what we wanted to have and he was able to gather a great design draft of the front and back yard of the house including a detailed estimate. Due to limits in our overall budget, we ended up doing our back-yard first. Daniel’s team worked at the house from the beginning as promised and they completed the work on the projected achievement time. The crew appeared each day at the house and worked tough in order to keep the work as scheduled. The crew was managed by Carlos who is a professional foreman, pretty detail motivated person and responsive to our comments. We were so happy by the work they did, that a year after we hired Daniel to do the front yard. Also this time the work that they did was excellent. Daniel and his team truly converted our house and improved the value of our house. We recently moved to a bigger house and we decided to rent the other house that American home improvement had remodel the landscaping for. When we purchased the house, the front and back yard was remodeled by another contractor (that was done by the previous owner) and that work was too bad and horrible. The backyard concrete was so bad, that we had to remove all the concrete and pour new one. We called Daniel as we decided to redo this whole backyard. We knew that we can trust on Daniel’s opinion on how to fix all the problems. We appreciate the quality of work of Daniel and his team at American home improvement. We look forward to have Daniel do the front yard in in new house too and we will hire him for any future remodeling projects. We highly recommend Daniel and American home improvement for all of your landscape needs."
5,"We hired American home improvement to remodel and upgrade all 3 bathrooms and 4 bedrooms at our house. The remodeling included paint with new colors and texture, the replacement of all the windows with new ones and we added few benches in the shower areas. After that, we replaced all the vanities and added in-wall storage cabinets including all the crown molding around. On top of that, they painted all the bedrooms at the house and tear down all the wall paper around the house. In the kitchen area we replaced the existing appliances with new ones, while adding the back splash tiles, new paint and new LED lightings. New light fixtures were installed in the family room and living room. The house looks very good and beautiful! American home improvement did everything they promised and even few more things that were added in the middle of the work. I will hire them again in the future for my next remodeling project. Thank you American home improvement!"
5,"It’s been a while since I wanted to remodel my house and mainly my kitchen. After a massive research for a construction company, I decided to hire American home improvement and to have them do the remodeling. At first I met with Shlomo and we discussed about the options and what can I do for the amount that I can spend. Shlomo came up with his plan and I just loved it. He then was able to generate a price that did fit my budget and I gave my permission for the work. Now that my kitchen is completed, I can state that hiring American home improvement for the remodeling was in fact the best decision I have made and they are the most reasonable construction company that do have a great customer service and they are very professional. Shlomo did not try to push anything sell me any extra things. More than that he put my budget as the main priority thing. I will definitely recommend Shlomo and American home improvement for any remodeling project."
5,"This is the second time I have used American home improvement for a remodeling at my house and as I was very happy in the first remodeling, this time was even better and I’m happier with the new kitchen. The new kitchen remodeling that Tammy and his people did for us included the replacement of the wood floor with new travertine one, new upper and lower cabinets, new appliances, lighting fixtures, home automated switches and outlets, new counter top with back splash and new plumbing too. The workmanship is outstanding, the attention to details and even to the smallest ones was remarkable and they refer me to some great sources for kitchen appliances, travertine, marble slabs and more. Like the last time of the remodeling, Tammy handled all the minor extras that I wanted to do or change during the work without any complain and with a smile on his face. I will hire them again next year for my master bathroom and bedroom remodeling project."
5,"I hired Daniel at American home improvement on two complete bathrooms remodeling project including the kitchen at my house and I was very happy with how it went and mainly came out! Daniel and Whitney are both wonderful people to work with and it was very useful to have them both do the design and execute it into reality with the amount of expertise they have which made this remodeling a huge success for me. Daniel did a marvelous job by listening and understanding my design goals and balancing them with his design skills to come up with a productive, functional and within budget work. Whitney was everything I needed for this remodeling from the paperwork aspect of it. She made sure that billing, permits, materials orders and deliveries will be smooth and will arrive on time so the work will keep moving as agreed. Daniel’s devotion to all types of details was something that I didn’t think I can see in this remodeling. At the end, my high anticipations were exceeded and I have received many great compliments on how excellent the bathrooms and kitchen looks. I highly recommend American home improvement and I will for sure hire them again in the future!"
5,"Working with AHI was such a great experience! They were skilled, trustworthy and professional. They offered different options and ideas for our kitchen remodeling project.  They worked within our budget and we are very pleased with the result!"
5,"American home improvement planned and designed our outdoor living space and executed it after we approved all the changed and modifications so it will fit exactly to what we wanted to have. At first, we honestly didn’t think that we can get all what we wanted under our budget because it was just too many things in one project. The project that we wanted to do, included a 2 levels patio with space for full BBQ with dining area, sink, refrigerator, counter top and a large stone fire pit with seating area. More than that, we added some plantings spots by building a plats pots, a new grass area, LED solar lighting fixtures, a new driveway and more things. We’ve met and interviewed many contractors and home improvement companies and landscapers over the last few months and none of them was able to compete to Isaac’s experience, quality and promise to ensure their work with our expectations. Each one of them had something that caused us to move to the next one in our list and when we met with Isaac, we felt that this is the right person for us and for our project. He was very respectful, hardworking and neat. We are proud that we selected this company from all the rest and because of our great experience, we highly recommend American home improvement and Isaac including all the office staff that was involved in our house project."
5,"When my wife & I purchased our home, we have probably met at least 5 contractors to bid on our major remodeling because our new house needed a lot of work. We were very skeptical on hiring anyone considering the amount of work that we needed to do with a tight budget. Most of the contractors we talked to didn't give us a lot of options & the prices we got were just outrageous. Then we finally saw American Home Improvement & since they were local to us we decided to give it another shot. For the first time when we met with one of their project managers, he was the only representative who listened to what we actually really needed & told us that he would work with our budget. We had minor issues during the construction stage but my project manager was always there to make sure he addresses every concerns & issues that we have. The workers were professional & polite which is for me the most important thing. If I also need to call their office for whatever reason the personnel were always accommodating & friendly as well. Overall we had a great experience with this company but most importantly, we love our new home -- the quality of work was great & I'm really really happy I decided to go with American Home Improvement. That's why I'm taking this time to share my experience & they definitely deserve to be recommended & rated 5 stars!"
5,"After the results of the final remodeling project that we got from American home improvement, we can write here that we couldn’t have asked for anything better starting with a skilled team or people or a better finished bathroom and Kitchen remodeling project! From the very early meeting that we had and all the way to the last cleaning, Mickey and his team were totally brilliant. Mickey was most helpful in coming up with the right decisions for our goals, he was clear, straightforward and honest about each stage of the work including the small details. They all were on time, respectful, and professional. They took extra care and attention in making sure that everything will be covered before starting to work and completely clean area before they left for the day and most of all when they complete the entire project. We had a master bathroom and a brand new designed kitchen that was worth each and every penny. We highly recommend American home improvement and Mainly Mickey to anyone who is currently looking to have any type of a remodeling project done. We sure that it will be everything and anything you were looking for while being delivered by a skilled and professional team who really prove a commitment to customer satisfaction and a job well done!"
5,"Working with Michael and his crew at American home improvement was a great experience. All of them were honest, skilled and professional. Prior to hiring them, we got few other estimates and American home improvement one was detailed, clear to understand and fairly priced. Michael took the time to get over the entire remodeling, explaining us everything and unlike other companies no one from them pressured us or tried misleading. We were very happy to do business with them and we valued that Michael and his crew were great communicators and all the meetings and completion date were all on time. Michael managed the entire kitchen remodeling and there we had no surprises or extras charges. It went very smooth than we thought and we are more than happy with the new kitchen. It looks beautiful and very functional. We will recommend them to anyone! Mainly Michael at American home improvement."
5,"American home improvement is for sure a Top Notch construction company! Daniel is an excellent person that care a lot for the happiness of his clients while making sure to bring any remodeling come true with extra attention to perfection and details. He is well organized and very strict on the project timing. He met with us several times before we even got the design of the remodeling project, the meetings were mainly for him to listen and understand what we really want to get from this project and after he understood that part, he start to share his ideas that were basically an improvement to ours. His crew of skilled people were very polite, making sure to keep all the area clean and neat as much as they could, dealing with any issue that came up during the work right away. All of the people that were involved at this project, we responsive to any of our comments and questions and they fixed anything and everything. We couldn’t be more pleased with the remodeling project that they did (a complete kitchen remodeling) and with Daniel’s supervision. We do trust this company and we will hire them for any future projects at our home."
5,"Daniel including the crew of workers from American home improvement recently completed a major remodeling at our house and they assisted us understand how the construction process should go, and helped us to achieve what we wanted and still stay within the budget that we had before the work while producing our new kitchen and bathrooms as we imagined for a while now. Daniel worked with us closely from the begging by drafting a design as a starting point and presented us the prices for step of the work, time frame for completion, and more... We definitely felt that he knew what he is doing and that was very easy to realize. Two things that really set American home improvement from the rest of the contractors that we came across with was that they were very clear about the work, more expert about the construction process and dedicated to our happiness. Thank you American home improvement - we could not be happier."
5,"We were looking to remodel our vacation house early of this year, and we wanted to create a brand new and functional living space that provided us an open layout and flow. Our budget was pretty fixed and we needed someone that will be able to do it within that amount. Together with Michel, we were able to create a perfect solution that allowed us to open up most of the kitchen wall and generating an additional opening that finally now can allow us to move and work on both sides of our Kitchen Island. All of our family fell in love with the new space and we enjoy cooking and entertaining all of our guests and family that come over from time to time. We are very happy and satisfied that our friends were able to refer us to American home improvement and are very fascinated by their amount of experience and craftsmanship. By working and dealing with Michel, we can state clearly that he was able to take away all the stress and worries of this big change for our house and he was able to turn our kitchen into something much better and larger than we ever imagined."
5,"This year we purchased a ""fixer"" on in a community near our main house. We have completed several remodeling projects over the last 20 years, all gradually more powerful and all as an owner-builder. Since this was the most challenging project, we decided to go with a company that can design and do the actual remodeling rather than hiring an architect and then searching for a bid from general contractors. We thought that we can have a bigger effect on the design and to create an efficiency by using a good team to reach the milestones together and shortening the process. Michael from American home improvement, has verified to be the perfect choice for us and he was able to start the work immediately after we closed escrow. We worked hand by hand in the initial design stage using 3D designs, floor plans and elevations drawn by Michelle presenting to us several choices and making changes on the way. After this process was completed, Michelle’s team produced for us the necessary plans and handled all the permits. 
Our contract was in two parts:
-First part ‘Design’
-Second part remodeling’ 
We were very happy and satisfied with the cost of the design, mainly because it included a promise of a good discount in case we go with American home improvement for the second part. When we decided to hire them for the second part, we were so happy with the quality and effort that American home improvement did for us that the discount was not that important no more. Michelle earned the additional benefit! This was a large project so keeping a sharp pencil has been critical in establishing costs within the budget. Michelle worked closely with us and allowed us to save the cost by making the project possible. It has been only three weeks since the remodeling was completed, but our years of experience in remodeling, we can see that our decision was well made. No struggle was wasted and there is no doubts about all the different teams of workers that worked on this remodeling."
5,"We had a truly excellent experience with American home improvement. Our remodeling project was to take down completely the old kitchen, rebuild it and remodel our 2 bedrooms, bathrooms and living room including the laundry room. The work started on the day and time that was set during our meetings with Jason and it was done on the day and time (with few days after due to some minor delays in the delivery of some materials) and it mainly stayed on our budget. The team of Jason listened to our comments and questions and they were very responsive to the approved design plan. They were very reliable, careful, and professional people. They were easygoing people to work with and to have in our house every day. Jason was able to make this remodeling project as easy as possible even though sometimes it was hard because all the problems that were raised during the work. I highly recommend American home improvement."
5,"Our recent experience with American home improvement and especially with Daniel was very good. We hired them to do a complete remodeling of our kitchen. Daniel was able to provide us with a great design that contained most things we wanted, custom cabinets, new flooring, granite counter tops and the relevant appliances (Ref, Dishwasher, stove and hood). Daniel and his people were able to finish the new kitchen in less than a month and the new kitchen came out the way we wanted and even more. What we mostly appreciate is that the overall price was within our budget and even though we did some changes during the work, Daniel did all he could in order to not add any hidden charges."
5,"I never imagined that my kitchen remodeling can be completely very fast and in a fairly price! Mickey and Elad were honest the whole time, consistent, supportive and just easy people to deal with. Before hiring them, I got several estimates and they were all higher than the one I got from Mickey. Their estimate also included more things than the other contractors such as higher quality of materials and home automation features such as outlets, lightings and thermostat. As part of the remodeling, Mickey was able to give me great suggestions on what I can and should include into the design of the kitchen and into the final product. I am very satisfied with the whole thing! Mickey went with me to his local vendors where I purchased the items I needed for the kitchen (flooring, tiles, countertops, handles, back splash and more…) – I can't say enough good things about them!"
5,"I am very pleased with the work that was performed by Mickey and his team. A friend recommended me to hire American home improvement for my house remodeling after he heard about the problem I’m currently having with the contractor that I just hired for my house in which caused me several problems at the beginning of the remodeling. After I called their office, Mickey called me and came over to my house the next day, checked and reviewed the work that was done and what still need to be completed while focusing on several problems that were caused by the previous one.  Few days later, he came back once again and presented to me his complete and fairly priced estimate on the entire work that still needed to be done in order to finish it. After our lawyer took care of the other contractor, I went ahead and hired Mickey to step in and finish the work. Mickey started to work few days after and his team came over to the house and started the work. Mickey came over the house each day to supervise the workers and to make sure that everything is going according to the plan while oversee the workers. He even did some of the work himself and the work was performed in a professional way, quick, polite and professional. I am very happy with the entire remodeling job of my kitchen, bathroom, entry, dining room and bathrooms and I strongly recommend them."
5,"Our house had a big water damage emergency and we were in a search for someone that will be able to bring all the damage spaces in the house so we can move back to our home. What we needed to do was to remodel the dining room, kitchen, powder room and the guest room including 2 bathrooms. On top of it, we needed to install new hardwood floor all around the first floor and to replace some light fixtures. The kitchen remodeling was the most complex one because it included the replacement of all the cabinets, counter-tops, sink, appliances, back-splash and all the finishing items. All the people that did the actual work at our house were professional, polite and hardworking. American home improvement did an amazing job and it was a pleasure to work and dealt with. The complete restoration project was done in a very timely manner. We definitely hire them again."
5,"We cannot write enough words about how happy are we with our kitchen remodeling that was done by American home improvement and managed by Daniel and his team of workers. His tremendous he started by helping us selecting the cabinets for the kitchen, floors, tiles, marble counter tops and all the finishing items such as the handles and more… more than that, all the office staff that were involved too, were very professional and polite during the entire work. In addition to that, the sub-contractors and vendors were also professional, experts, knowledgeable and honest in their tasks. The remodeling was finished on time and within our budget. They were well-ordered and the house was cleaned up after each day of work before they left the house for the day. We could not be happier and the new kitchen is absolutely gorgeous. More than all the above, Daniel didn’t try to either pressure us to sign any contract or to push us to add more items that we don’t need."
5,"Our remodeling project started with the wrong company that we hired for our second story addition and a complete first floor remodel on our 1100 sq./ft. house. When this happened, we left with a house that was unlivable. The walls were out of plumbing pipe, beams were missing and in a total complete mess. One of our friends recommended us to hire several companies that can come and finish the work but in the end, we felt that this will cause more and more problems. As our search kept going, we came across American home improvement and when we met with them at the house, we spoke to Daniel and told him what we want and if it can be done. Daniel came back to us few days after with a plan on how to take over and to complete the work so we can move in and start to enjoy our new house. While Daniel and his team did their plans and suggestions, we did more and more research about them because we wanted to be sure that our house will be completed. After all of our additional meetings with Daniel, We decided that we will hire them and we went forward with our remodeling project. Daniel and his teams of skilled people rebuilt our house in a better way than it should have been done from the beginning. He was able to combine his skills and vision in order to deliver outstanding product. The house came out much more beyond our expectations. He visited the house on a daily basis and managed the crews on top of ordering all the materials and scheduling all the subcontractors that worked at the house as well. Now that the house is complete and we already moved to the house, we can mention that our house is the evidence that they know how to take any remodeling project and to complete it while making the clients happy and without any stress. American home improvement price was very reasonable for the work that they did on our home. We truly hope that no one will have to go thru our first experience, but if they do... than they need to make sure to hire the right contractor that will be able to complete any remodeling project. American home improvement is a company that I would hire again without reservation."
5,"My husband & I hired American home improvement back in 2014 and we were pleased with the results of the work that they did at our previous house. This time, we hired them once again to do a remodeling of our kitchen and bathrooms at our new house and Sam & his team of skilled people were again amazing people. They all came to work on time & Sam made sure to keep everything under budget. The scope of this remodeling just increased our trust and appreciation in American home improvement. On top of the kitchen and bathrooms remodeling, we also painted the house inside & out, got rid of all the popcorn ceilings throughout the house & added LED lights too. Sam is a professional, designer & great listener. He heard us in order for not only understanding what we want but helping us make our vision come true. Our house is now what we really knew it could be. Thank you Sam & your wonderful team for this great remodeling at our house.  We thank Sam & everyone at American home improvement! We have already recommended them to several friends."
5,"We give Ziv and David (from American home improvement) a A+ rating for the remodeling project that they did for us.
 The remodeling project involved the kitchen which includes: 
-Installing granite counters
-New back-splash and cabinets
-Relocating and installing the new stove and sink 
-Installing new lighting system.
 In addition to the kitchen, they did other few projects in other parts of the house like:
-Raising the entry ceiling.
-Putting in new doors, etc. 
We adore the completed remodeling every day since it was completed a month ago. We found American home improvement on the internet and we asked them to meet with us about in regards to the kitchen. We were fascinated with their knowledge, and design ideas. While they prepared the proposal, Ziv came over to the house more than once and meet with us before we signed the contract. Once we started the work, we valued his capability to manage the project. They met with us at the cabinet maker’s shop where we saw several cabinet Designs, and they assist us with all the details. Ziv did a great job with all his communications with us and with all the other people involved. Ziv and the whole crew were friendly and great workers. They followed through on all fronts and exceeded our expectations. We are very happy with the final outcome and give our highest praises to American home improvement."
5,"After a big research that we did that included meetings and interviews several of them, we ended up hiring American home improvement. Isaac was assigned to us as the manager for the project and the supervisor for the crew. He was professional and straightforward with the costs. His communication skills were great and he was available for us to answer all of our questions and ideas. This showed us how he was passionate and eager to get the job right and not below than perfection. After Isaac presented us with the designs, we set and run numbers to see how can we fir everything within our budget. Surprisingly enough, Isaac was able to fit 90% of our vision into the budget so the decision to go ahead with the work was finalized and set. More than that, American home improvement was able to share with us the cost of the design which made it much better for us because we could add more items to the remodeling. Our remodeling project was to renovate the entire kitchen and to replace all the appliances and flooring. We want to thank Jacob and the rest of American home improvement for everything they did for us."
5,"After a long time of research and interviewing several companies, I hired this company to do the work. The work started with several meetings with Mickey and we spoke on what to do and how to do including the styles, relocation of the refrigerator and the time scheduling. Mickey managed this whole thing and he had his crew working each day while reporting to him about their progress. The first week of work was demolition the old kitchen and prepare the space for the installation of the cabinets. During the whole work, we had no problem with them or with the communications between us to Mickey or his office. I’m happy with the new kitchen and with the work that they did."
5,"I had a very good experience working with American home improvement. I worked with a Shlomo who was my project manager and he was very resourceful and skilled person. When I met with him, he brought several samples of similar projects that he did recently and he shared with me many ideas that could fit to my remodeling while he was very focused to what I wanted. During the second and third meeting that we had, he went over with me on all the details of the work and even brought a digital design of how the new kitchen will look like after the remodeling! The final kitchen remodeling was exactly like the design he had designed. The cost of it was fair and good and I never got the feeling that he is trying to add more money to the work or by making any short cuts. They had very skilled working crew as well and they were able to complete the kitchen remodeling in a very fairly time!"
5,"I hired American home for a remodel of my guest house and addition of a master suite, I couldn't be happier with the work they did. My project manager Shawn was always available to answer my questions and the work turned out better than I imagined."
5,Excellent job!! American Home Improvement has done an incredible work remodeling my kitchen! I could not be any happier with the work done. It completely changed the look of my house! I highly recommend this company!!
5,"Working with Shawn was great, after visiting their location and meeting the  staff I felt very comfortable with my decision to remodel. 

The process wasn't always easy but Shawn made it easy for us to live in the home during construction. The workers were very polite and the projects were completed on time and I couldn't be happier."
5,"American home improvement helped me remodel and completely make my home energy efficient and made it affordable for my family to do so with a energy efficiency financing option. All of the employees there knew how to guide me and answer all of my questions during the project. I have a new roof, texcoat and windows. I was also able to upgrade my electrical panel and will be having solar panels installed in the next few months."
5,"Great working with this contractor, my bathroom needed some serious work and we found mold in the process of demilolition. Jeff did his best to keep the cost reasonable and the project was completed at our satisfaction."
5,"I'm very happy with the results of the work performed by American home improvement, the kitchen looks spectacular and I couldn't be happier with the crew and Micky my project manager very responsive with all my concerns and questions during the process."
5,Victoria and Mike kept us up to date all  on the details progress of the kitchen remodel and living room update. Victoria's vision fit the house and what we were looking for in a new kitchen. She was always quick to answer any question we had. They worked around us being in the house. The electricians worked past midnight on one occasion trying to solve a problem that turned out to be a power company issue.  Very happy with the outcome of the remodel and have gotten many compliments on the change.
5,"Laura at S & W Kitchens was fantastic to work with, she listened and deigned my perfect kitchen! I absolutely love my kitchen!"
5,"From start to finish, S&W did a fantastic job on our kitchen, bedroom and bathroom remodel!  From Traci, the designer, to Kevin, the Project Manager, they were always on top of things and extremely responsive and communicative.  Would definitely use S&W again for any future remodeling!"
5,"We chose S&W Kitchens to renovate our guest bathroom.  This extremely small bath had all original fixtures dating back 34 years.  We began the process in October 2021 by visiting the Longwood design center.  Later we called to schedule an estimate and they paired us with Sarah.  From start to finish on this project Sarah has been amazing.  Since this was our first remodel she walked us through the entire process never hesitating to answer all our questions.  

She never tried to persuade us in any one direction on colors, tile or fixture selection.  Being new to this process we would ask for her design opinions and she was always honest and upfront about each item.  Sarah corresponded with us on multiple occasions throughout the life of this renovation to ensure all was going as planned and to inquire about any of our questions, comments or concerns.  

Throughout the life of this renovation there were a number of contractors who came to work on this project:  plumbers, concrete cutters, a framer, tile installers, painters, drywall installers, electrician, threshold installers and delivery personnel.  All of these contractors were highly skilled in their field.  All the contractors on our project were very respectful to us and even cleaned the work area before leaving each day.  

Our renovation took three months from the start of construction.  In all, a total of 35 days from the first home visit to the last walk-thru.  We are so extremely pleased with all the quality work which has been done throughout the course of the project.  We have a beautiful guest bathroom to enjoy for years to come.    

Sarah was our rockstar!  She is so kind, patient and puts the client first.  She is easy to talk to and discuss ideas and appears to really enjoy her work.  We will definitely request Sarah for our next renovation."
4,"We recently finished our master bathroom remodel with Sarah Kraus, and now we're starting on the guest bathroom. Sarah was fabulous! In addition to her detailed design work, Sarah was patient, kind and responsive to emails and phone calls. Best of all, she was an advocate for us when we had workmanship questions or concerns. That's the primary reason we chose to work with her again."
5,"We just had our first experience with remodeling our kitchen and S&W Palm Harbor did not disappoint! Shirley Aguilu, project designer, and Steve Cota, superintendent, are outstanding...their knowledge, guidance and patience throughout the project made the experience very pleasant. We had many questions since this was our first remodel and they were friendly, trustworthy and responsive. Everyone including the contractors and installers had an impressive attention to detail and their workmanship was top notch! We are so thrilled with the end result and highly recommend them!!"
1,"We hired them Feb 2021 to remodel two bathrooms and outdoor grill. Absolute disaster! Attached is what our master bathroon looks like now April 2022. We have finally come to the point where we had to make a claim against our insurance. Beware of this company. Our designer was Sarah Kraus. Never saw her after the demo. The first GM for the job Brian Pop, he walked out right after everything was demo'd. The second GM Pete Coffman was just as bad. Actually caught them trying to cover up water damaged wood caused by them using cheap materials. They hung up towel racks with just screws, not anchors. Towel rack fell down during first use! Seriously BEWARE! We have water damage and a bathroom still torn up after more than a year."
5,"I recently finished 2 bathrooms with S&W in Palm Harbor, Florida.  Kirsten Phillips was our designer and Mike Frary was the project manager/GC.  They were fantastic.  S&W has an app that allows you to know exactly what is scheduled each day, what is planned and easily connect with the team.  All of the subcontractors were pleasant, respectful and helpful. I am sure it wasn’t easy, one bathroom is on 2nd story, one on 3rd story. I had a vision of what I wanted, shared that and pictures with Kirsten and she helped me through all of the processes.  I picked out things that I knew I wanted and she helped guide me in areas I was unsure.  We built the house 20 years ago and kept putting off doing the bathrooms.  Now I am so happy, I should have done it sooner.  I highly recommend S&W, they were fantastic to work with.  And huge thanks to Shirley A who helped set me up with Kirsten to keep personal friendship and business separate."
4,"S&W Kitchens did a great job with our kitchen renovation. We have a small kitchen that was not in the best shape and we were really looking for design solutions to create more useable space without changing the footprint of the kitchen. Sarah was our designer and really listened to what we wanted and did a excellent job designing our new kitchen. She also provided us with many options within our budget so we could get something that fit our aesthetic without breaking the bank. The only issue with the whole process was with our backsplash tile, but Sarah and our site supervisor Adam, listened to our concerns and worked to address the problem so that we were happy with the results."
5,"My wife and I were very pleased with the professional experience we had with S & W Kitchens Palm Harbor.  The designer, Shirley Aguilu, provided excellent ideas, listening to our ideas, and producing a kitchen renovation plan that encompassed all of our requests.  The team, including Shirley, Steve, Tony and Amber, were on top of all aspects of the complete kitchen renovation.  This included frequent contact to ensure the job was being completed, and ensuring all segments (installing floor tile, cabinets, laundry room, countertops, backsplash, plumbing and electrical work) were correctly completed.  We highly recommend S & W Kitchens Palm Harbor, for their work."
5,"All we can say is WOW!  S&W Kitchen did a fantastic job renovating our kitchen. The difference between our old kitchen and new is like night and day. Our kitchen was old, falling apart, cabinet doors not closing, bowing shelves and poor lighting.  Lindsey Schwartz, our Project designer, was great to work with. She guided us through choosing cabinets, flooring, backsplashes and every detail of our kitchen make-over.  She pointed out less expensive choices although we did not always listen, and different options. The demolition and installations teams were all very professional and courteous. They always let us know what they were going to be doing and when.  We highly recommend S&W Kitchens."
5,"S&W Kitchens does fantastic work—from the design all the way to the punch list. They were perfectionists with our home. Our designer, Laura, listened carefully to our needs and came up with a beautiful design. She gave us just enough choices that we felt like it was our personal design without being overwhelmed by selections. We remodeled our kitchen, master bath and guest bath, and we couldn’t be more pleased with the results. We feel like we have a custom home. We fell in love with our construction crew—Kevin, Steven, Scott and Brian along with top notch subcontractors. They were meticulous about their work and took care of every tiny detail. They were professional and friendly too. We felt very comfortable having them in our home—whether we were at home or away. We have recommended S&W to family and friends."
5,"Our Kitchen & Fireplace were very out dated!  We had heard good things about S & W Kitchens so we went to check them out.  Our first impression was great.  We met with Designer, Amy Downs and was very impressed with her knowledge & experience.  She has amazing design ideas!  Signed our contract & we were ready to start.  We then met with the contractor, Davin Johnson.  He was also very experienced & professional.  Renovations can be a bit stressful, but we new we were in good hands!  Davin always updated us as to what was happening and when.  We got finished before our due date!  We can't thank S & W Kitchens enough for our beautiful transformation!  Oh yes, and we got our house professionally cleaned too, the team was amazing!!  My house was spotless.  We would definitely use them again."
5,"Victoria Pratt was an outstanding partner and provided a level of customer service that I truly appreciate.  She was friendly, informative, and helpful while we made our choice of wood countertop.  I first went online to find an outstanding butcher block or wood countertop product, called the manufacturer of the product and was informed S&W Kitchen was their distributor of that product in the Tampa Bay area, near our home.  Once I went in and started engaging with Victoria she struck me as highly professional, informative and knowledgeable about the product and how it would look in our kitchen remodel.  Victoria took the time to come out, see the kitchen remodel and helped me select a product.  She was also there upon delivery of a 200+ lb wood countertop and helped me quickly find an expert installer for such a beautiful product.  I enjoyed working with Victoria and would recommend her services and S&W Kitchen to anyone who asked."
5,"My kitchen remodel is so beautiful!  The project manager Brian,  communicated effectively so were kept informed of timelines and next steps. Our designer, Marilyn listed to what we wanted and helped us create our dream kitchen! All of the contractors were very professional and treated my home respectively. They even greeted my nosy puppy who had to come say hello to everyone who came to the house. Highly recommend!"
5,"S and W did our kitchen makeover after 44 years of living in this house.
I found them to be very professional, clean and respectful of our property.
I would suggest them to anyone considering a renovation"
5,"From the start of the bathroom remodel to the end, Whitney at S & W Kitchens took a dream of what we wanted our bathroom to be and made it a reality. Our bathroom was original from 1988 and needed to be completely upgraded! At the start we scheduled a visit with Whitney and laid out the parts we needed and wanted to incorporate into our bathroom. Whitney then helped us to pick out a color scheme and quartz countertop, tiles, floor, lights and accessories. After about a week, Whitney drew up a CAD design to show us how the bathroom would look like and showed us. We immediately loved it and signed the paperwork to get it started. Because of the pandemic and wood shortages, it took about a month to get all the supplies together for the bathroom (Still good if you ask me) and then they delivered them to our garage for safekeeping. Mike, our foreman, met with us to lay out the work schedule for the remodel and set a demo date. Mike was attentive to our work schedule and our concerns of making sure our cat did not get out. Therefore, Mike made sure to let us know when people would be coming so we could put our cat in a room. All of the people who came to work on the bathroom respected our privacy of not going in the doors that was marked that our pet could be in. Over the 6 months of the remodel (This was finished on time), Mike and Whitney were available for any and all questions, concerns and gave updates on everything. Our bathroom exceeded our expectations on how it was going to be. The new shower is roomier and awesome, more cabinet space and the countertops and sinks are spectacular! We both are very impressed with Whitney and Mike at S & W kitchens and without hesitation will use them again in the future!"
5,Excellent work and professionalism! Would hire again. They worked with us to make sure we were satisfied with all our choices.
5,"Having our kitchen redone with S&W Kitchens has been a complete life changing experience.  We own a 100 year old bungalow that had an original kitchen with granite slapped on top of the teeny tiny dollhouse size cabinetry.  We knew when we bought our house we would redo the kitchen, but had no idea with whom.  We stumbled upon S&W online and read through the reviews.  Larissa designed us the kitchen of my dreams, within our budget, while thinking of every detail and how we could maximize storage and obtain the aesthetic and type of environment that were so important to me.  Our superintendent, Christian, was excellent through the entire process.  The amount of time and effort he put into the construction of our kitchen totally surpassed by expectations.  If you are considering a kitchen reno I highly recommend S&W for the job, and HIGHLY recommend specifically working with Larissa, you will not regret it."
5,"S&W completely remodeled our kitchen and two baths.  Did it all go super smooth?  Not really, but what did go consistently right was designer Lacie Rice.  She worked with my wife and me from the beginning to the end and helped to resolve issues that arose along the way.  We are more than satisfied with the results and cannot speak highly enough about Lacie."
5,"Total bath remodel; pricey and started months later than we'd hoped - partially due to COVID and personnel change, but once started, project manager Davin was on top of all, employees and subs were all professional and we are very pleased with final product."
5,"We enjoyed working with S&W Kitchens! We built a new house and used them for not only the kitchen, but all the bathrooms as well. Everything turned out beautiful. Mollie was great to work with, very helpful & informative! Even though things were delayed due to Covid, we were in the loop throughout the whole process. The installer's attention to detail is 2nd to none. We are beyond happy with the way everything turned out in our home!!"
5,S&W is a five star company.  Lacie and Steve were excellent to work with and kept us informed through every step of the process.  We plan to use S&W for third project to renovate our kitchen.  If you have a project go with S&W and ask for Lacie and Steve.
5,"FANTASTIC Experience! We have been working out of our home since March of 2020 so we decided now would finally be the time to upgrade the kitchen to one we had been dreaming of for many years. We did our homework, read reviews and visited the S&W Kitchens Showroom in Melbourne, Florida. We were greeted by Laura Scott who was friendly, knowledgeable, professional, and honest, which made it easy to quickly develop a trust relationship with her. Laura ultimately became our Designer and as she gathered our requirements, she listened to all of our wish lists and concerns, and she shared lessons learned to help guide our decision making. She offered excellent suggestions and ultimately created a design that far exceed our expectations and enhanced the layout and function of the original blueprint. She also provided quick and timely communication throughout the entire process. Laura delivered on every promise she made, and she routinely stopped by to check in on the progress and make sure our expectations were being met. 

We had a pre-construction meeting at our home where we met the various superintendents and project managers that would be overseeing the job. We were provided with documentation that included all of our diagrams and decisions, and a thorough timeline of when we could expect events to occur. They offered expert advice on what to expect and answered all of our questions. They even were considerate of our dogs and ensured us of their safety. Our Project Superintendent, Vinny Mallo, provided excellent communication on scheduled workdays and arrival times. He worked closely with the crews and provided thorough oversight. The crews (demo, plumbing, electrical, cabinet install, backsplash tile, countertops) were extremely professional and provided quality work in a timely manner. From the virtually invisible seams on the beautiful quartz countertops to the expertly laid intricate backsplash tile, we were so impressed with the quality of work. They were always on time and presented virtually no disruptions to us, even in our telework environment. We were also impressed with how clean they kept the environment, hauling away debris at the end of the work days, and keeping all of our areas orderly. 

Bottom line…we are EXTREMELY happy, highly recommend Laura Scott, and S&W Kitchens and would definitely use their services again."
5,"S&W Kitchens brought me out of the 70s! My remodel was better than I ever expected and the cost less than estimates I had received from other companies. The remodel included removing my walls and ceilings down to the studs. After our first meeting, my designer, Sarah Kraus, knew exactly what I wanted and needed. She went by my color schemes and chose the cabinets, tile, backsplash and lighting perfectly. I love the results!  
My supervisor, Brian Pope, responded to my calls and any questions I had immediately.  I felt he went over and above what was expected of him. Both projects were done on schedule and my home was kept as clean as possible while the work was in process. I now have an open floor plan and a beautiful, efficient kitchen and master bathroom. I would highly recommend S&W Kitchens and especially Sarah and Brian. Thank you for my beautiful finished project."
5,"We wanted to update our kitchen and laundry room. We wanted to replace our builder grade cabinets and granite counter tops with high quality cabinets (with better organization), quartz counter tops and slab backsplash. I spent a lot of time planning my dream kitchen and laundry room. Right down to the last detail. We also needed new sinks, faucets, and pendant lights. One of the biding companies expected us to source these items our selves. What a pain! That was one of the main reasons we chose S & W Kitchens and Bath. 

The other reason we pick S & W was after meeting our designer, Lacie Rice. She came to our home and took measurements and listened while I laid out my vision. She made the process so easy. I met with her several times in the showroom in Tampa to shop and design. She found everything I wanted. She even matched the outlet covers on the island with the cabinet color. 

We met with construction manager Steve Cota and Designer Lacie for a final walk through of the plans and discuss the process. Everything was explained thoroughly. The estimate and final contract were meticulously detailed. We could see where every dollar would be spent.

Every team (demo, plumbing, electrical, drywall, paint, cabinet install and counter fabricator) worked hard. They were respectful and tidy. Every step of the way Steve and Lacie were accessible. The back and forth communication was excellent. The permits all passed with no issues. They even sent cleaners before my house guests arrived for a holiday weekend.

The quality of the Omega cabinets are excellent. The color is perfect. The Cambria Quartz counters and backsplash are beautiful. The kitchen and laundry room are much more functional now, too. Everything looks exactly how I had pictured in my mind. We couldn’t be happier with the results. It looks amazing!!!"
5,"We are so pleased with the total kitchen renovation we recently completed with S&W Kitchens in South Tampa. We literally demolished our original kitchen, removing walls, going all the way down to the studs and built a brand new kitchen. Our designer, Larissa Hicks and her design assistant, Gina Cerimele were able to take our basic kitchen ideas and design the perfect kitchen for us. The design process was very collaborative and at the end they were even able to come up with some creative solutions to keep our project within our budget. The construction phase went very smoothly. When we came across a “load bearing beam” in an unexpected place, the team quickly adjusted the design plan with minimal cost incurred. Mike Frary was our construction supervisor and he did a great job keeping us informed and the job on schedule. I highly recommend S&W Kitchens and designer Larissa Hicks for anyone who is doing a kitchen renovation."
5,"S&W Kitchens did an amazing job on our kitchen and bath remodel! Greg Flassig was our designer, and he did an amazing job! Also Pete Coffman worked with us to get the construction done. He was great at explaining everything, as well as promptly answering any questions we had. Both were there for us the entire time. The crew did a great job. Thanks for a great job!"
4,"We had our master bath remodeled.  It took a little longer than expected for the project to be completed.  Part of the delay was due to the shortage of building materials, not S&W Kitchen's fault.  The Kitchen & Bath Project Designer, Sarah Kraus Bartelson, and Super Intendent, Brian Popp were helpful, efficient, and easy to work with. 

We love our master bath and this company has our recommendation!!!

Lonise"
5,"Our new kitchen is stunning! The whole experience was so well organized from planning, choosing materials, and construction completion. Our designer, Mayerlin, was very helpful and responsive. S&W stayed true to budget and on schedule. All of the contractors who came to work in our home were on time, dependable, professional, and very clean. I will definitely use S&W again. Highly recommend!"
5,"In one word, AWESOME!  I hired S&W Kitchens to remodel both of my bathrooms and my laundry room in a condo that I had just purchased.  I have done some other renovation projects in the past and I was concerned that they wait until all your materials are in stock before they start.  But now I totally get that concept!  There were delays with a few items and I wasn’t waiting around in a demolished house.  Demo started once everything arrived!  Savana, Dale, Kevin and the rest of the team did an amazing job.  They were kind and courteous to me.  And clean, neat and respectful of my home.  If a problem came up, they fixed it immediately.  They finished a week early and stayed on budget.  When I’m ready to do my kitchen, they will be my first phone call.  I would highly recommend S&W Kitchens for any remodeling project."
5,"It was amazing to see my design come to reality in this kitchen renovation. The S&W kitchens team was  so amazing.  My designer Sarah Kraus and my construction Superintendent Brian Popp were so professional and stayed on to of creating the specks /details ,and scheduling all the different contractors and inspections in a smooth manner. They really hire excellent subcontractors that really know their specialties very well. They all cleaned up their  area very well after each job,  protected the furniture and floors very well, and were careful not to damage their surroundings. They subcontracted Zolt Granite for the quartz and they too did an excellent job. The only 2 drawbacks I had was that I went into contract after Thanksgiving 2020 and the project did  not commence until the 6th of January 19, 2021. Luckily the project was completed in 4 weeks. The other concern is that they were a lot more expensive than we thought, but they really provide quality work, so that really counts."
5,"We engaged S&W Kitchens to assist with renovating our kitchen.  Our project was relatively small.  It involved replacing the existing granite countertop with an quartz countertop as well as making alterations to the configuration of our counter.  S&W also performed ancillary work such as replacing our kitchen sink and faucet.  They also replaced the countertop and sink in our laundry room and make some modifications to enable our dryer to fit properly.  Laura Scott was our designer and she remained involved throughout the project to ensure our satisfaction.  We were impressed by Laura's professionalism as well as by the quality of S&W's work.  We were provided detailed plans for our project which the various tradesmen followed to a tee.  Our project was completed efficiently, on time and with minimal disruption to our home.  S&W expended a lot of effort on detailed finishing to make sure that every aspect of the countertop, as well as the existing cabinetry, was perfect.  We would highly recommend S&W Kitchens for any home remodeling need."
2,"The full review is too long for houzz's submission field. Here is an abbreviated review.

We had several problems with S&W and I could not recommend them as a premium service.

They mis-measured our kitchen from the start and didn't catch that error until months into the project. We had to redesign the kitchen on the fly and they don't seem to take responsibility for the fact that we did not receive the kitchen we ordered.

They are clearly accepting more work than they can handle, and their workers are exhausted and distracted. This led to several errors. My full review has a page worth of bullet points as the errors were numerous and costly.

They damaged expensive materials, and left us to find the problems. There are finish issues that remain to be completed, and I have been waiting nearly a month for any answer to my ongoing issues.

This project also took month's longer than the original completion date.

Our foreman quit our project any further repairs pretty much finished once they got things nice enough for a pretty picture.

Some of their ""premium"" products are already having issues with coatings coming off, and blemishes from install that were never repaired.

They are a mediocre service charging a premium price."
5,"We selected to use S&W Kitchens in Longwood after reading all their reviews and completing a consultation meeting with our designer to complete the total remodel of our kitchen & 3 bathrooms in our home. Considering that we had started this big project in late February/early March 2020 prior to Covid-19, we are very happy with the final results and end product and design. The whole remodel did take longer than expected and there were a few delays & hiccups...but over all we love our new kitchen and bathrooms. Sarah, our personal Designer was an instrumental part in the entire process and a joy to work with. She was professional, open-minded in our vision, creative and understanding to what we wanted in our home regarding design & specific efficient functional needs for our family...also all while keeping our budget in mind without compromising quality and design. Robert our General Contractor was experienced & knowledgeable and also was pleasant to work with and was in communication with us and the entire team. Our entire S&W project team Sarah, Robert, David, Kevin & Craig were professional and great to work with. We are very satisfied with the work performed and look forward to enjoying our home with family & friends. Thank you to our S&W Kitchens Longwood Team for bringing our longtime vision for our kitchen/baths remodel into a beautiful reality. It was all well worth it!  ~Dan & Tiffany Marcos"
5,"S&W Kitchens, Melbourne proved to be a “first-class” company to address renovation of my master bath which was damaged following a lightning strike at my home.  Because the bathroom had been completely gutted (ceiling, drywall, cabinets), the challenge was to salvage as much of the original custom cabinetry, fixtures etc. using my own contractors (plumbers, electricians, cabinet installer etc.) and then replace my countertops and vanity sinks for an updated look and style.  From the moment I entered the S&W state-of-the art showroom, I was impressed with the array of choices and quality of products.  More importantly, I discovered that designer Laura Smith is worth her weight in gold!   Laura carefully listened to my needs and guided me every step of the way.  After her visit to my home, we selected the Kohler sinks and the perfect Pompeii quartz (Valley Sand) with copper veining to compliment my existing maple cabinets and Plantation Shutters.  As an added bonus, due to her prior background in working at a plumbing showroom, she also advised me of drain assembly parts needed for my existing faucets and provided other helpful-hints for the re-build.  She was able to schedule countertop installation within a short timeframe (far more quickly than other Melbourne fabricators).  Throughout this project Laura communicated frequently with me and was professional, pleasant and caring.  I am delighted with the results!"
5,"Back in January, we started the process to renovate our main living space focused around our kitchen, we delayed construction some as we wrapped our heads around working/schooling from home in March/April.  Starting in June, the construction made an already hectic summer that much more interesting, but in the end it was totally worth it...  working from home post-renovation these last couple of months has been that much more enjoyable!  Here's a few pics of before and the professional final shots.  Anyone looking for a recommendation, S & W Kitchens was so great to work with!!"
5,"This review is late in the making. Sarah Kraus did such a great job in designing my master bath and bedroom. This is the second time she has worked with me, which says something. If you have not worked with a designer you need to. What I love about Sarah she not only helps me get ideas, but she is hands on from beginning to end. With any remodel project things come up. Sarah handled every concern I had, amazing. I love my new space. Can’t believe it is the same room."
1,"We were excited to begin a remodel of our outdated kitchen, laundry room, dinning room, living room and office and decided to use S&W Kitchens, even though the price was considerably higher due to their promise of excellent service and customer satisfaction. That was not the case at all. There were problems right from the start with broken promises, incorrect measurements, a breech of our bank account information involving the police department due to our paperwork and personal check being dropped in the street, wrong materials ordered and delivered, poor workmanship, damaged and incorrect cabinets, incorrectly fabricated granite, damaged and destroyed new appliances, workmen not showing up when promised, the list goes on and on. It's been over a year since we first met with the designer, and over nice months since the gutting of the area first occurred, and we are just now getting the final replacement cabinet doors, of which one was still blemished. Our remodel has been the laughing stock of our neighborhood and we will be finishing parts of the job ourselves. This has ended up being, what we call, ""The most expensive do-it-yourself project ever."" Even with the overall design being very nice, we see constant reminders of how badly everything progressed."
5,"When planning to remodel our kitchen we never thought that our Dream Kitchen could come into fortition this AMAZING. Sarah Kraus literally saw our vision from the minute we started to talk.  She listened to our ideas, was attentive to  our needs and circumstances, thoughtful in not only the work she does but goes the extra mile to get to know the client , organized as well;  if you were to request a copy of anything she has it readily available.  This process really does set the customer up for true comfortability during the crazy process of redesigning a kitchen.  The time line presented was reasonable and finished well around the time given.  The team that worked with her, Brian_ Project Manger, David- carpenter and the other fields contracted in to assist with the job were always professional and considerate.  The kitchen design is beautiful, simply breath taking.  Every detail we discussed and designed were delivered. The craftmanship that was taken into our stair railings is UNBELIEVABLE.  They brought our Pinterest idea to life, with of course a some designing ideas from Sarah !  We have done many remodels with contractors and this by far was our best experience.  I highly recommend Sarah at S&WKitchens.  She is very talented and TOP NOTCH!"
5,"We used S&W Kitchens for our total kitchen and foyer renovation.  We literally changed everything from our floor to ceiling in each room.  S&W handled every aspect of our remodel.  They handled everything from demo, plumbing, electrical, flooring, ceiling removal and all of our kitchen cabinets are custom made perfectly for our kitchen.  Our granite is absolutely gorgeous and looks like the ocean it fits perfectly with our home decor, colors, etc.  Each employee who came into our home were very nice and respectful.  They cleaned their work space every time they worked at our home and also sent a cleaning service into our home to clean any dust that built up on our furniture during the demolition.  We have 2 dogs that loved the employees as well and it made the process even more enjoyable.  Our designer, Lacie, was absolutely in tune with that we wanted and was patient as we took our time to pick out each piece of backsplash, tile flooring, granite, lighting, etc. We are remodeling our dining room next and we are 100% sure we  are using S&W again for this renovation."
5,"My husband and I recently had our kitchen remodeled by S&W Kitchens.  We had new cabinets and countertops installed.  The entire team was  timely,  competent, and a pleasure to work with.  Our communication with the designer and site supervisor was excellent.  We were always aware of the status of the construction.  Being in the midst of covid,  the work teams had temperature checked and face masks on during their time in my home.  We highly recommend S&W Kitchens."
5,After many many searches for a vanity we went with S & W kitchens my designer Sarah Kraus walked me thru the process.  The vanity had to custom designed for the space needed.  They vanity is beautiful the staff at S & W are wonderful I would recommend them to all my friends ❤️
5,"After searching 3 years for a good company to help me remodel my master bathroom, I finally found the perfect company.  S&W Kitchens did an excellent job!  They have excellent designers, project managers, and a great team who completed the job on time (even during the summer of Covid 19), on budget, and the final result exceeded my expectations!  What else could you ask for?  I will definitely be using them again in the future and highly recommend the team out of Melbourne, Florida.  Special thanks to Lindsey and Dale for making this such a positive experience!"
5,"We've just completed a project with S&W Kitchens.  They're ""not just kitchens!""  We began with several planning conversations with Carol in their showroom and in our home.  She was helpful all the way, asking all the right questions, providing sketches as the plan came together.  It was no small task: removing the tub, removing wall tile, re-directing the plumbing and drain, installing new tile on the walls and floor, new shower fixtures, a corner seat, grab handle, and sliding glass shower doors.  The end result is beautiful with nothing being damaged along the way.  All of the materials are top quality, all of the craftsmen were skilled, pleasant and knowledgeable, working under the careful eyes of Carol and of our superintendent, Pete who scheduled everything masterfully, communicating each day resulting in minimum disruption of our household.  We were so impressed with their work we asked them to undertake another project, new vinyl-plank flooring in our home office."
5,"We are very satisfied with our kitchen remodel with S&W Kitchens.  Our Project Designer, Mayerlin, was very helpful in getting us the right design for our needs & preferences.  Our Project Manager, Brian, was very thorough, straight forward, and always kept us up to date throughout the process regarding scheduling of electricians, plumbers, inspections, ordering etc.  We were never in the dark as to what was going on, which made us feel at ease throughout the entire process.  We highly recommend S&W Kitchens as they were great for us.

5,"My wife and I are extremely satisfied with services provided by S and W Kitchens during the complete remodel of our master bath. From design to completion, Sarah was accessible and attentive during the entire process. Was available for unscheduled site visits to verify design changes and the always unexpected issues by providing on site communication with the installers and stayed touch through the process. Most importantly the result came out the way we wanted. In many remodels the work can end up being what the contractor wants. Sarah listened to what we envisioned. A special thanks to Robert Ungavarsky, the superintendent for the project, for  handling and providing recommendations for issues as they came up and for the addons we unexpectedly came up with.
We would highly recommend Sarah and her team at S and W."
5,"My husband and I recently undertook a major renovation of our kitchen, master bathroom, and guest bathroom.  We were extremely fortunate that we selected S&W Kitchens as our partner in this renovation.

Christina, our designer, was brilliant in understanding our goals and worked closely with us on color schemes, tile patterns, kitchen appliances, kitchen island space, bathroom hardware, and more!  From day one of demolition (thank you, Tony!) to the final day about nine weeks later, Mike, Christina, and everyone that worked to make our dreams come alive were exceptionally competent, responsive, professional, and friendly.  At the conclusion of our project, our kitchen and bathrooms were dramatically more beautiful (and highly functional) than we had imagined possible in our dreams.  

When you partner with S&W Kitchens, you collaborate with true experts.  I simply cannot adequately describe how well everyone, but particularly Christina and Mike, worked with us on all details, adjusting work schedules and “projects within projects” to come to completion smoothly, without glitches.

We also enjoyed this renovation project – all of the people involved were amazing to work with!  Anyone with a dream in mind would do well to contact S&W Kitchens to see that dream be realized.

5,"Moving from Texas to Florida was quite a challenge.  We wanted to be closer to our children and find a home to accommodate our 2 horses and 4 dogs.  The home we found was ”A 
diamond in the rough”!  The only thing it had going for it was the lovely trees in the front yard, enough acreage for the horses and a move in ready barn.  
The day I walked into S and W kitchens and met Laura Scott was my best day since moving to Florida.  My kitchen (and the rest of the house) was not functional and so, so outdated. I explained my dilemma to Laura, and thanks to her positive attitude, she said she was up for the challenge.  And what a challenge it was.  Not only was the existing kitchen design a challenge, I had already bought the new appliances for the new kitchen.  The transformation from old, dark and outdated kitchen to a new, bright, updated and perfectly designed kitchen is amazing.  Laura is an outstanding person a designer.  She is the best along with the rest of the S and W Kitchens crew.  
Our kitchen is perfect!  George and Jo Rosenhauer"
5,"My wife and I are extremely satisfied with the entire scope of services provided by S and W Kitchens during the complete remodel of our kitchen. From the initial design to the final cabinet trim, Sarah remained accessible and attentive during the entire process. This included, but was not limited to effectively dovetailing our vision with her design expertise, site visits for design consultation and measurements, and subsequent verifications prior to ordering, on site communication with the installer and staying in touch through the entire process. From working with us to find the perfect slabs for the counter tops to helping us select our appliances we highly recommend Sarah Kraus and her team at S and W."
5,"We had a total kitchen remodel done by S&W. Rosemarie Szedula was our designer, she did a fantastic job from start to finish. She was ever present and kept everything on time and on track. Her design and features were wonderful, she had many great ideas that we love."
5,"We recently had a bathroom, kitchen and bar area renovated by S&W Kitchens. We entered a project of this scale with some trepidation, but overall the whole process went smoothly and we could not be happier with the outcome.  Designer Lindsey Schwartz and superintendent Dale Thomas were diligent in the planning of the project such that each aspect was scoped out in detail before they started.
Lindsey was always a pleasure to work with, knowledgeable about overall design elements as well as available products, and always responsive to messages. She was able to guide us through making style choices without imposing her personal preferences. Dale was always on top of the project, available to meet to discuss details, and had the knowledge and foresight to avoid problems that might occur. 
All of the personnel, including the construction workers were diligent and courteous. 
All in all, we are incredibly pleased with our renovations both aesthetically and from the quality that went into them. We would work with S&W again in a heartbeat."
5,S &W are wounderful people to work with. They are extremely professional we did had some minor problems but they took care of any problem that popped up.  They did suggest an appliance person that i used and they are helping me where the appliance company wont. Not there fault. The appliance company has some deal with a warranty company called dish do not use the dish warranty. But again Dale and Mike are awesome to work with.
5,"Roisin Wong, our project manager at S&W Kitchens, was simply fantastic! She guided me through the entire process of renovating our kitchen from start to finish: layout, cabinet selection, lighting, countertop and backsplash and installation. She is professional, patient, friendly, talented and incredibly helpful! She knew our budget and gave several options to help me stay within that budget. She asked questions and made suggestions based on the way we use our kitchen. As it is the most important room in our home, she helped me put together a space that is light, bright and welcoming. Most important, she designed a space that completely fits the design of our home! I wholeheartedly recommend Roisin Wong."
5,"I had an excellent, gold-star experience with S&W Kitchens. My designer, Fred, was outstanding and went above and beyond to strategize ideas for accomplishing my bathroom remodeling goals. His creative solutions to my needs were wonderful! S&W is a first class company that employs first class, top notch employees. Everyone on the team was professional, cordial, friendly, knowledgeable, and fun to work with. I enjoyed working with them on a first name basis  and getting to know them a bit. I found them earnest and hardworking. They treated me not only as a client, but a real human! I would recommend anyone interested in S&W's services to contact them!"
5,"After sourcing many companies and meeting with designers, I made the final decision to hire S&W for a complete remodel of our very outdated 23 yr old kitchen. There wasn’t a designer I met, that I was more comfortable with then Roisin Wong. We met with over 10 local companies and two from out of the area, I was drawn back to S&W based solely on my interaction with Roisin, her compassion, patience, & level of expertise proved to be the right choice.  Throughout the entire project I had my share of panic attacks and once again, Roisin eased my fears, concerns and Michael addressed any issue or complaints I had. Overall, the kitchen is amazing, the layout gave us additional space, something I thought would be impossible. Everyone who comes into our home, gives us endless compliments as to how beautiful our kitchen is. I cant thank S&W enough for the professionalism and outstanding quality of work. I would definitely recommend their services, coming from someone who’s had their share of horrible contractors."
5,"We really disliked our kitchen at one time, and decided to do something about that by hiring Sarah of S&W who came highly recommended.  The transformation to our new kitchen is amazing! Not only does it look beautiful, but it is very functional and we now have more storage with a very important new coffee station. Sarah gave us a kitchen with a purpose and so aesthetically pleasing! We have received many compliments. We love it and enjoy every second!!! Sarah truly brought our vision to light! Thank you Sarah!!"
5,"We have done 2 renovations with S&W (master suite and kitchen plus flooring throughout house) and have been thrilled. Laura is a gifted designer who just ""knew"" what I would love - she was right AND professional down to the last detail.  Dale and crew are experts and dedicated craftsmen.  I enjoy working with them all and would NEVER consider using anyone else."
5,"My wife and I heard about S&W kitchens from our friends at Real Radio 104.1.  After doing a little homework of our own, it was a rather easy decision to go with them for our kitchen renovation.  We weren't planning on remodeling our kitchen however due to a leak in our old dishwasher we were forced into the situation.  At first, we were somewhat concerned with the timeframe, budget, and the quality of product we would be able to afford.  My wife had a vision in her mind of what she wanted the kitchen to look like.  Fortunately, we ended up working with an amazing designer at S&W Kitchens, Sarah Kraus.  Not only was Sarah able to offer us several high-quality options within our budget, but she also worked diligently with us to provide an itemized list of the products and services that were in scope for the renovation which was required by our insurance provider.  We met with Sarah personally in the S&W showroom as well as in our home on several occasions and she worked around our busy schedule to accommodate us.  Once the design was completed and construction was underway, Sarah made sure to keep us informed on what work would be done and by whom.  As with any major construction project, there are always a few hiccups along the way.  What impressed me the most about Sarah and S&W Kitchens was the confident reassurance that they would take on any unforeseen issues in stride and ensure the job was done not only to meet our requirements but also to meet their standard of excellence.  Sarah was easy to communicate with by phone, e-mail and in person to discuss any concerns.  With little to no delay she provided us with a remediation plan each time as well as a follow-up to ensure any and all issues were taken care of.  In the end, my wife and I are extremely happy to say that our kitchen is now picture perfect, and with the customized personal design, our house feels even more like our home. A big thanks to Sarah and the rest of the S&W team that made it all happen."
5,"Our master bath remodel was our second project with S&W. Once again we are delighted with the results. Not only is our new master bathroom gorgeous, it is efficient and functional. No more clutter on the counter or in the shower. Everything is hidden away while still being conveniently within reach. The construction team addressed every detail, resulting in the flawless execution of the design. They were courteous, professional and respectful at all times. 

We worked with designer Laura Scott as we had on our kitchen project. Her approach is collaborative and we knew she would help us bring our vision to life. She listened to our needs and desires and then offered fresh ideas that complemented ours. We appreciate how she touched base with us frequently from design to completion. 

Bottom line, we recommend S&W and would definitely use them again."
5,"I recently finished a renovation of my kitchen and laundry room with S&W kitchens. I had used them before for my master bathroom.
I highly recommend them. It was a very professional job.
Of course the process wasn’t completely smooth but at every turn they came up with a good solutions to any problems encountered .
Krista Agapito my designer and Pete Coffman my construction manager were excellent. Krista’s design made my kitchen and laundry room much more functional and beautiful too. Pete was great with keeping me informed everyday with what was to happen; which I greatly appreciated. Pete was also excellent with solving problems along the way.
I what definitely recommend the whole team at S&W Kitchens ."
5,"We have used S&W for both our kitchen and master bath. We are very pleased with both projects. The workmanship and professionalism of all the trades was top notch. 
We feel the leadership and involvement of Robert Ungvarsky, the contractor and Mary Burkhammer, the designer, insured a positive experience. 
Robert’s daily involvement and communication kept us current throughout the process. That was greatly appreciated."
5,"We hired S &W for our master bath remodel after online research. Kristin (designer)  performed a thorough in house courtesy consultation with very accurate measuring. We met at their Windermere location for  a 3D, no pressure presentation and obtained an estimate. Once we committed to the project  we got introduced to Robert Ungvarswky our project manager.  From that moment on he was in charge on scheduling and keeping us informed of  day to day progress mostly via txt message with real time pictures . We encountered some unexpected work order changes but remained confident on their ability and disposition of finishing our project and meet our high expectations   We are happy with our final product and reassured that we can always contact them for any questions since they use reputable local companies And high quality materials,  Robert showed great professionalism and was available to address all our questions which made the process less stressful. I would recommend S&W to friends in the future"
5,"Review for S&W Kitchens WINDERMERE location.
Necessary bathroom renovation (LAKE NONA) to make shower larger with wide door and ability to roll-in wheelchair when necessary.  Removed tub to expand shower area and elongate sink wall which gave much more storage space.  Wasn't planning this project, but became a necessary project for medical reasons, and couldn't have gone more smoothly.  If you are really price shopping, this probably isn't the group for you.  But if you have enough going on in your life already and want to know that the team is going to do the project properly and not cut corners, and be there when they say they will be there, then Robert and James are the team for you.  You will pay more, but I have seen some questionable construction around here but not with these guys.  Everyone was on point, the design, the construction, tilers, electricians, plumbers, paint/drywall.  If any construction project could ever be considered great, this was it.  It was a pleasure to welcome every member of this construction team into our home and if it ever becomes necessary again, I won't even consider anyone else."
5,"I highly recommend this Contractor.  I hired them on word of mouth, and they've done 2 bathrooms in a home which I just sold, and we are on our third now, in my home!
I am working with Shirley and Eric, and their professionalism is impressive.  Construction is, by nature, chaotic, messy, and noisy.  They minimized all these factors, and I am able to let go, and let them handle it every time. When it is time to do another, they will do it!"
5,"S&W Kitchens (Melbourne, FL office in particular) is a great company to work with, and Laura Scott is a wonderful designer. 

I hired them to remodel our 35 year old kitchen and had no clue where to begin. Laura walked us through the planning process with great patience and ease (and cheerful demeanor) beginning with an assessment of what we currently had and what we were hoping to accomplish in the finished design. With that understanding of our needs she worked up several proposed configurations and presented them to us as 3D and 2D presentations. Then she guided us through the material selection process for color, style, and mechanical configuration. Once we were satisfied with all that, she worked up a final plan including a detailed List of Materials and work plan. 

During that process we also met with Dale (construction lead). Together they laid out a timeline for the construction giving us a time window of best case and worst case duration. For the most part, they hit the timeline as promised and finished within the original prediction window.

The work crews were polite and friendly. We felt very comfortable having them around the house (no security concerns.) They answered any questions we had while they worked and during the job progress. They worked carefully and kept the house as clean as possible by removing construction debris each day and hauling it away (no dumpster in the driveway!). Floors were protected with heavy-duty cardboard mats that were taped in place to prevent damage. Our hardwood floors came through the process without damage. We used plastic drop-cloths over everything each day to shield from dust. (It's inevitable that dust gets everywhere. Buy a stock of A/C filters and plan on changing them out every day or at least every other day during demolition and early phases of the construction, especially if drywall work is going on.) They can also place plastic sheeting to close off rooms as much as possible but the circulating air carries a lot of dust around the house nonetheless.

Measurements were taken of our kitchen on at least two occasions ('measure twice, cut once' theory) so as to be sure they were correct. However, we still ended up ordering a special cabinet in one position as the one cabinet was too wide for the location because they ordered the wrong size. 

The quartz countertop fits perfectly. Alignment and seam work are exceptional. I couldn't find the seam until my wife pointed it out to me. The quality of the back-splash tile work is also exceptional. The installer meticulously hand fit pieces around the difficult areas. After the cabinets were installed, Laura inspected them and ordered replacement bits for anything that was scratched or dinged or had questionable surface finish. They cabinet installers adjusted all the drawer slides and cabinet hinges for proper operation.

They had first indicated that they would stage all the materials in their warehouse and then bring them over, then we discussed storing them in the garage, but we were concerned about humidity issues and bugs, but in the end the materials were all staged in our family room. (We moved everything into the other rooms to make room for the materials. It had two benefits: first, it was adjacent to the kitchen so it made work efficient and easy; secondly, all materials were under A/C and so all dimensions stabilized in the wooden parts prior to installation. It was inconvenient for us because of the crowding but it was probably the best solution in the end.)

It is inevitable that remodeling is inconvenient. However, S&W Kitchens did their best to make everything flow smoothly. We are very pleased with the finished result and I easily recommend S&W Kitchens and Laura Scott for anyone seeking to remodel their kitchen."
5,"The team at S & W of James, Robert, and Aniko did an outstanding job of design and build with our kitchen remodel/renovation.  They managed the entire project from start to finish.  They kept us in the loop throughout and the project was on track from the beginning.  The final results are incredible, beyond expectations, and we are very happy.  We would recommend S & W and this team if you're considering any type of kitchen or home remodel.  We will surely use them again for our next project!  Thanks again!"
5,"Thank goodness for S&W Kitchens! My husband and I had had bad experiences with renovations and contractors in the past and were beginning to think that there was no such thing as a good contractor. Luckily, we found S&W Kitchens. Whitney Rutledge immediately understood our style and knew what we were after from a design standpoint. She planned out our kitchen renovation for maximum utility and suggested features that brought our kitchen renovation to a whole new level. We are thrilled with what she and her team accomplished and we couldn't be happier!  We definitely recommend Whitney and S&W Kitchens for any project. You won't be disappointed!"
5,"We bought a fixer upper condo on the beach. We had heard so many horror stories of remodels gone bad. We hired S&W because of their great reputation for customer service. We were not disappointed. Lindsey Schwartz was our designer.  We did a complete remodel of master bath and kitchen and minor remodel on the two guest baths. She clearly knows what she is doing and was a pleasure to work with. We were impressed with the quality of work and how easy it was to work with S&W. All workers are given  background checks.  This was important to us because our condo was not going to be livable during construction. Dale, the construction superintendent, was great. He impressed our condo Board of Directors.   We needed their approval to proceed, so this was important. We did not get nickeled and dimed  to death. The price in the contract is what we paid. Every Friday, I received an email from Lindsey with photos on progress for the week and plans for the next week. 

 Everyone who has seen our remodel is totally impressed. They are a high end remodeler and you will be happy you hired them."
5,"Whitney worked with us for several months to find exactly the look we wanted for flooring, backsplash, paint, countertops. IT turned out better than we could have imagined! Mike managed the construction and was very responsive to our requests and change orders. Thanks Mike and Whitney!!"
4,"S&W Kitchens delivered on my kitchen remake. It was a long and tedious process, but construction manager, Pete, was on top of it all. When things didn't work out, he moved in and got it right. Especially the wonderful company, The Groutsmith, who worked wonders in my   kitchen backsplash tile.  Thank you Pete, and S&W!!"
5,It was a great experience working with Lacie Rice from S&W Kitchen in South Tampa.   They took great care of us and the end result is a stunning a high quality Poggenpohl kitchen.  Recommend S&W to anyone.
5,"We worked with S & W to remodel our master bath.  Working with Carol our designer was a pleasure.  She made us feel comfortable and valued.  Our project manager, Pete was easy to work with and kept us updated on the project and let us know when to expect workers on a daily basis.  Carol and Pete and the whole S & W team were always respectful of us and our home.  We could't be happier with the finished  project.  Would highly recommend working with this company!"
5,"I chose S&W Cabinets to redo my kitchen. Shirley and team from GC (Mike) to all the individuals that performed the many tasks were great and highly professional. They kept me informed and as the project progressed. Mike even made sure that I had a functional kitchen as soon as they could, since this project occurred during the holidays.
I love my new kitchen so much I’m having them redo my master bath. Looking forward to this project."
5,S & W did a great job and we are 100% pleased with our beautiful outdoor kitchen! Working with Yina was a pleasure and we highly recommend her - she was always available and totally responsive to all of our needs.
5,"I totally LOVE the way my kitchen came out.  With the assistance of Laura at S&W, it is my dream kitchen that I waited 21 years for.  I love to cook and this kitchen makes me want to do more.  I will post pics at a different time.  I had my colors in mind, but the selection and staff were great.  Will definitely use them again, most likely in bath room."
5,"I had been planning and visioning my outdoor living area for a couple of years before finally pulling the trigger. I had numerous companies come out to provide designs and quotes to best accomplish my ideas. I chose Sarah with S & W Kitchens to move forward with my project because I was impressed with her background and willingness to research ideas that she had not done before. The work went as scheduled, the job was clean and everyone friendly. When the project was complete, it was exactly what I had envisioned and I could not have been happier. I have been described as very particular and have frustrated contractors on previous projects with my expectations. The team at S & W did not bat an eye and made sure that everything was completed exactly to my request. I would highly recommend Sarah and S & W Kitchens for anyone that is in the market for an upgrade or an addition to their living area."
5,Mayerlin at S&W Kitchens was our designer for our kitchen remodel  She was very professional and very easy to work with.  She took the time to make sure our needs were met within our budget.  Everything was done on time and our kitchen turned out beautiful!  I highly recommend Mayerlin and S&W Kitchens.
5,"S&W Kitchens redid our kitchen and replaced all our tile flooring in the house.  Designer Jaime was patience itself as he helped us select product, guiding us to the price, quality, and styles that we were interested in.  He accommodated our schedule for meetings at home and at the show room.  Project supervisor Austin kept us informed through every step of the process.  He communicated with us every single day, most days in person as he stopped by to check on the work.  If not in person, then on the phone.  If I needed to call him, he always answered my call.  All the workers did great work, were polite and efficient.  I would most definitely use S&W Kitchens again."
5,"The S&W team lead by Krista was phenomenal to work with during our entire process. She, Mollie, and Haleh from the Winter Park location were intuitive, creative, and had follow through after every meeting. They gave clear direction and recommendations. Dale, their specialist that did the install was professional, polite, and very talented in making any needed adjustments to  our cabinets. There's nothing better than working with experienced people that actually listen when we're investing in high quality cabinets with smart designs. I would 100% recommend them for any design needs."
5,"We had managed several home renovation projects in our previous home and we were reluctant to start another one in our current home knowing the time commitment and the disruptions to your life.  As a result, we thought we would start with a small project of replacing our kitchen cabinet doors.  Our research brought us to S&W Kitchens.  After our initial meeting and learning they were a full service company, we decided to switch projects and move forward with the renovation of one of our guest bathrooms.  Once we connected with Lacie Rice in the South Tampa office, we loved the entire process!  She was amazing to work with and had great design ideas.  The S&W process was fantastic – Lacie and Mike (construction foreman) facilitated everything for us from design, demo, renovations, and inspections.  Lacie reviewed every finish/detail, budget and calendar with us up front.  The timeline was accurate and the project was completed on time and within budget.  Lacie and Mike were awesome to work with during the project – they were very communicative and were great with our dog.  We did not worry about a thing – it was the smoothest renovation project we have ever had!  The finished product is beautiful – we love the new bathroom and our family does too!  We highly recommend using S&W for anyone that is contemplating any house renovations.  We will be using S&W on our next project.  Thank you Lacie, Mike and S&W Kitchens!"
5,"We started out with the intention of hiring a contractor to perform a  modest kitchen renovation (replacing cabinet doors and countertops), but even that proved to be daunting as we needed to manage and schedule each trade separately.  Then we found S&W Kitchens.  S&W acts as the general contractor and handles everything from design to renovation and appliance installation. 
Our modest kitchen renovation mushroomed into a whole house makeover – we replaced everything in the kitchen (including the appliances which we ordered through S&W), added new wood flooring throughout the house, renovated a bathroom, added crown molding, built out a new pantry, and more.  
Lacie in the south Tampa office was fantastic throughout the design and construction process.  She spent countless hours with us not only in her shop and in our home, but also accompanied us to our numerous visits to varied locations to select our countertops, plumbing fixtures, electrical fixtures, etc. Eric was the construction foreman on our project and was likewise great to work with.  We couldn’t be happier with the finished product and would definitely recommend S&W to anyone contemplating a home renovation project, large or small."
4,"Everyone I came in contact with was professional, patient and knowledgeable, including the subcontractors. Workmanship was good and communication was timely and clear.
I would recommend this company as long as u don't mind paying a little more."
5,"When we decided to do a complete teardown and redo of our kitchen, we knew we needed a full-service company that would manage the process, start to finish. We definitely got that with S&W Kitchens.  They took care of every detail and gave us a new kitchen that exceeded our dreams and expectations. 

We knew we needed a designer that we would feel comfortable working with. Our designer, Laura Scott, listened to us and completely understood our vision. She used her design know-how and considerable talent to pull together a kitchen that is not only beautiful, but incredibly efficient as well. There is nothing better than function meeting form and she definitely achieved that for us.  She was attentive to our project throughout the process, checking to make sure all was going well.  She went with me to the slab yard and patiently viewed all the countertop options to narrow down the selection.  I really appreciated her helpful suggestions and support during the selection process.  Picking out the color palette and the various materials for the kitchen was a breeze with her guidance.  Looking at the result, we would not change a thing. 

We were impressed with the S&W planning process where no detail was overlooked. A great deal of attention was given to planning, which we believe is a large part of the success of the project. S&W provided us with full documentation, including all of our decisions, plans and diagrams for the crew, and the sequence of events that would take place over the course of the project. The project stayed on track with only minor delays, resulting in a fully functioning kitchen by the promised end date.

Our project manager, Dale Thomas, is highly skilled at managing a project.  Not only did he keep the project moving, he used exemplary problem solving skills to resolve issues that came up along the way.  He elicited excellence from his crew, trade contractors and vendors.  Observing him in action, we came to trust that we were in good hands with Dale and crew.
Friends had warned us that a kitchen redo of this magnitude would be a horrible experience.  But S&W made it as painless as possible. Before tearing down the kitchen, they moved our refrigerator to the dining room so that we could set up a temporary kitchen to use during construction. They were thoughtful of our comfort throughout the process, keeping disruption to a minimum. The crew was friendly and considerate. They cleaned up at each step of the process and hauled away multiple trailers full of debris. They hooked up our washer and dryer early on to allow us to do laundry at home as soon as possible.  Long story short, the experience was far less disruptive than we expected.  

In a word, S&W stands for excellence.  We are glad we went with them and would definitely use S&W again in the future."
5,"I have worked together with Matt Carpenter on multiple occasions now and would highly recommend him to anyone in need of a professional cabinet designer.  His projects always run smoothly from start to finish and his ability to incorporate amazing design features is second to none.  Keep up the great work Matt, I look forward to the next one!"
5,"Just completed a major renovation (kitchen, bath, laundry room and fireplace) with S&W Kitchens. I choose S&W because of a recommendation from a friend and neighbor and to avoid all the “night-mare” kitchen remodeling stories I have heard over the years.  S&W came through for us and it was a stress-free remodeling project. Our S&W designer, Mary Burkhammer took the time to understand our design goals and vision and added the detail to turn our dream into a real plan and design. My husband is a detail-oriented engineer and he was greatly impressed by the S&W design and build process. Our construction foreman, Robert Ungvarsky turned the design into a reality.  They send master craftsmen across all the trades to complete your project. Believe me, you will not find this level of craftsmen in the yellow pages. I’m so satisfied with their work, I will be calling S&W to remodel my master bath."
5,"I am an interior designer in Orlando, and I have worked with Matt Carpenter on several of my projects.  The experience has been nothing but positive.  Matt is easy to work with and creative as well.  We have worked on large custom jobs as well as more simplistic projects.  The result has always been the same, total customer satisfaction and ease of execution.  I would certainly recommend them for your cabinetry job.

4,Lacie and Eric were great to work with.  Lacie was told that I was not a shopper and to select 3 options from which to choose.  Everything she put forth was spot on and in keeping with what I was looking for.  Eric came and saved the day after a bit of a glitch with the original onsite leader.  Eric was able to make sure the project was on track and worked very closely with Lacie to ensure a quality deliverable.  I really enjoyed working with both Eric and Lacie. They are both very professional and care about doing what is right for their client.
5,"I have worked with Matt Carpenter many, many times over the years as an industry professional. He has designed everything from full custom kitchens to display vignettes for my customers.   He is an expert in his craft, acting as both a very talented designer (one of the few who will still hand sketch out a rough design to give a customer a visual) and as a true consultant to his customers, taking in to account their budget and lifestyle and thinking through all of the little details that will give them their perfect end result.  He's a true professional, and a pleasure to work with!"
5,If you are looking for a company to do a complete kitchen renovation look no further.  These folks have amazing ideas and are easy to work with.  Bill and Tim were both friendly and knowledgeable.  I am very please with the outcome of my kitchen remodel.
5,"I have had three remodeling jobs done by Bill and Tom of S & W Kitchens in Longwood, Florida. One bathroom and my kitchen were totally removed and rebuilt.  The other bathroom was basically refreshed with old wallpaper removed new flooring, bathroom hardware, vanity, mirror and fresh paint. Bill provided the decorating expertise while Tim supplied the project planning, supervision and selection of fantastic craftsman. My kitchen had some layout issues that compromised its utility.  These utility issues were completely resolved and I was left with a much more useable space.  All three spaces always receive compliments from my guests. I recommend the pair to anyone considering remodeling."
5,"S & W kitchens did a great job for us.  Replaced all our cabinets and we love them.  We found working with them a joy, all the workers were very professional and friendly.  I would recommend them anytime.  Working with Lindsey, my designer was great!"
5,"Having endured several competitors, we would go as far as saying Matt and his team at S+W are one of the most proficient and professional Cabinetry businesses we have come across. With x5 Bathrooms and a Laundry room to fit in our new build, the choices, design options and eventual outcome was exactly as we wished for.
Thank you Matt.
George + Rita Brewster"
5,"I bought a house on bayshore 2 years ago and decided to totally remodel the whole kitchen.  After interviewing a few designers, we settled on S&W.  This is a totally honest review and anyone is welcome to come see our amazing kitchen. The design of the kitchen was amazing.  Wolf and Subzero appliances, great layout, beautiful counters, cabinets and flooring.  It's been a year and we are still amazed at how well it came out. Larissa was our designer in the Tampa office and she is totally gifted. Our foreman was John and he kept us up to date through out the project. The subcontractors were pros as well.  The price was agreed upon upfront and that didn't change even though there were some changes along the way."
5,"We chose Sarah at S&W because of her design ideas, listening, and understanding what effect and style we wanted to achieve.  She has been wonderful to work with--very talented with lots of great ideas.  We realize we're not always easy to work with, but Sarah has been wonderful throughout the project."
5,This is the 2nd phase of our kitchen remodel. Kristin Rutkowski and S&W crew were very professional in meeting our needs. Our Project Manager Robert Ungvarsky kept us up to date on crews coming in to work on our house. They were very professional and listened to our needs and requests.  We love the new change updates such as moving Washer and Dryer and placing additional Cabinets into our Galley Kitchen Design.  Love the extra space.  Thank you Kristen and Robert for a very good experience .
5,Couldn’t be happier with the job Matt Carpenter did for me on our latest project. Professionally managed from beginning to end. Highly recommended!!!!!
5,"We contracted S&W Kitchens to do our kitchen remodel and we are super happy with their work. Kristin Rutkowski was our designer. She presented to us great choices for countertops, backsplash, and fixtures that worked well together and were stylish. Pete Coffman, our project superintendent, was always on top of every detail and made sure we knew what was going on every step of the way.  The workers were reliable, knowledgeable of their craft, polite, and took pride in their work. We are so glad S&W did our kitchen and we highly recommend them!"
5,"Worked with Kristin Rutkowski at The Expo Design Center. Very talented and professional. If you are needing a good and competent designer, you are in good hands!"
5,"We needed a complete kitchen and master bathroom renovation and after 3 quotes for the job we selected S&W Kitchens. Whitney, Jeff and project supervisor Eric were all so professional, helpful and knowledgable. Whitney's help in everything from the design to the selection of cabinets, counter tops and matching tile to existing flooring. The plumbing fixtures I had in mind she was able to match to a brand that fit our budget. 
All the workers were professional, friendly and cleaned up after they had finished working.
Our floors and furniture were well protected and the whole house was very clean when the project was completed.
Whitney was so pleasant to work with. She is very detail oriented and communicated with us throughout the project. We were kept informed of what and when the next phase was to happen and the project finished on time. There were no unpleasant surprises!
We highly recommend this company."
5,"I have worked on several homes with S&W over the last couple of years and the experience has been fantastic! Matt brings years of experience, knowledge, and creativity to make each and every project unique. I know when I bring a client here they are taken care of from start to finish because of Matt’s dedication to the project; from the initial sketches to detailed drawings to on-site meetings and installation. I will continue to bring my clients to Matt and the S&W team for their outstanding customer service!"
5,"After a previous kitchen project with S&W we were certain that they would be the ones to remodel our bathrooms. As expected, the same quality was delivered. Larissa was there every step of the way, creating a design that was what we had imagined and seeing every detail through to its final stages. Larissa's assistant, Yina and construction manager Mike were excellent and responded quickly to our questions. 
When looking for a company to remodel your home you want someone to trust and S&W is just that."
5,S&W were incredible.  Krista listened to what we wanted.  They provided a detailed set of drawings to review.  They changed the drawings until the design was perfect.  The budget was fixed and our family and S&W found ways to make it work.  Then the work began.  The team was professional.  The workmanship was at the highest level.  If the work was not as indicated on the drawings then it was reworked.  Changes happened and adjustments were made.  The project finished on schedule.
5,"Lindsey Schwartz and Savanna helped me update my kitchen. I wanted to keep my cabinets but add a new ""coffee bar"" and cabinet in one corner. I also chose new counter tops and back splash. The coffee bar area is wonderful and the cabinets fit the area perfectly. The match to the old cabinets is almost perfect. The new back splash makes the area brighter and more cohesive. The contractors were great and it was a pleasure to have them in the house. They kept to the schedule and did a great job."
5,"Sarah Kraus was our designer and liaison for the complete remodel of our master bath. She and Tim Hobson (contractor),  both with S& W Kitchens and Baths,organized and followed through with quite a complex project.
We had worked with Sarah before, remodeling 3 baths. She has an incredible work ethic and great ideas-also, she is a joy to work with!  We had a time constraint but all was complete on time and looks beautiful!"
5,"Integrated Kitchen ------ Lake Mary Fl

The kitchen renovation we have been planning for many years impacted almost our entire house.  We needed a contractor who would handle the project turn key and deal with all the trades.  
The team from S&W Kitchens did an amazing job.

First and foremost, Mayerlin Ferreira our designer was wonderful to work with. 
From the day we walked into the S&W showroom until our final completion she was fully engaged in our renovation.  
She looked closely at our tentative plans and listened to our intentions. The design choices that Mayerlin offered made our product selections easy. 
Our new integrated kitchen has all the features we desired and exudes extraordinary style.  

The project management team kept us informed on scheduling, inspections, and progress.  Considering the magnitude of the work, their realistic yet customer friendly communications kept us informed all the way through.

Finally, the trades(wo)men who performed the work were all professional and did high quality work.  This project was from ceiling to floor.  The drywall, paint, electrical, plumbing, tile, cabinetry, counter top and cleaning people all performed beyond expectations.

S&W Kitchens was certainly not the least expensive option.  
However, considering the magnificent results, we are extremely satisfied.  
We highly recommend S&W.

Sincerely
John & Janis P"
4,We started off great guns but then had a problem with the permit which put timeframes off quite a bit. Cleaned after each day. End product came out great and was totally satisfied with end results. Only concern I could voice is more communication. I like to know often what is going to happen next and when.
5,"The wife’s dream has finally come true! Thanks to S & W Kitchens, their designer Gayle McCaughin and superintendent Dale Thomas. Gayle designed our 33 year old kitchen into a very elegant fully functional space and Dale worked together with the various trades to minimize our down time! Everyone was very courteous and accommodating to our needs. We chose S & W because of Gayle’s design presentation, Dale’s quality assurance and the selection of cabinets and accessories. Also, the numerous positive reviews and that S & W had multiple locations in central Florida."
5,I had a design  that was perfect  for a loft place in my home but I could not find a co. to build it. Just happen to stop in S & W Kitchens and meet a designer named Mayerlin Ferreira. She was best person I had found to help with my project. She understood me was up front with cost and  it was a wonderful working experience. I would use her again for any project  in my home.
5,"I and my wife, Anne,  are most satisfied with our  kitchen cabinet project with S & W Kitchens. We appreciated working with Sarah Kraus from our 1st in-home meeting with her, our style and finish selections and installation experience. She answered our questions and addressed each concern. The whole experience was a very pleasant one."
5,"S&W, Longwood, did a fantastic job remodeling my condo. I had a basic idea of how I wanted my new kitchen to look; Greg Flassig’s design gave me more than I had thought possible. Greg listened carefully to how I wanted my kitchen to feel and he presented me with options that created my dream kitchen. Greg and his team paid careful attention to every detail. In addition to the kitchen, S&W removed and replaced my popcorn ceilings throughout with a knockdown finish. They installed new flooring and coordinated with my carpeting company with my painters to ensure a seamless completion. I will definitely use Greg and his team again and highly recommend them."
5,"We absolutely love our bathroom remodels (Master and Guest).  An outdated space was turned into our own personal spa.  Our designer, Sarah Kraus was a dream to work with.  A complete professional that helped us bring our vision to life making it nicer than we could have imagined.  We are busy professionals with hectic schedules.  Sarah, was considerate of our time and flexible with her schedule.  Remodeling can be stressful.  Sarah ensured we had a pleasant experience.  She has great vision and will help you make the most of any space."
4,"I absolutely love my new master retreat!  Thanks to the incredible design ideas of Sarah Kraus, I have an incredible master bedroom and master bath.  Sarah took a 1980’s bathroom with a huge tub and tiny shower and redesigned it into a luxury spa oasis.  I asked for a “wow” factor and she delivered.  The old tub area is now an incredible shower with a river rock floor, quartz seating and beautiful quartz and river rock shelving.  The shower wall with the window is framed in a unique tile that brings the beauty of the view into the room.  The cabinetry is elegant and functional with a ton of storage.  She turned a tiny shower into a linen closet and added a new dimension to the room by adding a barn door with a mirror.    The quartz waterfall, countertop, and shelving are a beautiful finish to an incredible space.  Sarah is very nice to work with and she listened to what I wanted and took my suggestions and designed the rooms to my personality.  If you are looking to transform a space into something special, Sarah Kraus is the person for the job.  You will not be disappointed in her artistic, creative abilities.  I would highly recommend her.   
The review would be 5 stars if I only considered the designer and the final product.  However, since this is a review for S&W Kitchens, I can only give 4 stars.   We had so many issues with our master suite remodel.  We went through 3 superintendents and the first 2 were not very organized and did not communicate with us.  We would show up expecting to see progress just to find out that things had not been done and no one bothered to let us know.  Even with the detailed instruction book, we had a lot of mistakes.  The tile folks used the wrong grout on the entire floor, added a step down into the shower and cut and tiled one wall so that everything was off center.   By the time Tim Hobson came into the picture, we were weeks behind schedule and completely frustrated.  Tim immediately started communicating with us and all of the mistakes were corrected and the job was completed.  S&W did provide additional work at no cost to make up for the mistakes that were made during the renovation.  Sarah's design and choice of products deserves a 5+ star rating."
5,"Sarah was magnificent. She worked tirelessly to ensure the bathroom design we were looking for translated into exactly what we wanted. Her suggestions and recommendations were always with our best interests in mind. She maintained regular communication to keep us ""in the loop"" and aware of any work schedule changes.

Sarah had a great eye for detail and was extremely knowledgeable of all pertinent bathroom-related products. Her suggestions were based on knowledge, and not just guesswork. 

The finished product is nothing short of a thing of beauty and surpasses all we could hope for. We can't wait to show it off!

Thanks Sarah for taking the time to work with us. You did a fantastic job!"
5,changed a shower into a bathtub for the grandkids.  great designer and tileman.  a little pricey but got an high end quality product.
4,"Have worked with Andy Meeder with S & W Kitchens on several 
projects. He is a tremendous designer with a sharp eye.
A great talent. I hope we have many more together."
5,"We were fortunate to have Laura Scott and Dale Thomas create a gorgeous master bathroom for us where none existed before.  There wasn’t any existing plumbing and the electrical had to be totally redone as it wasn’t up to code.  We live in an old 1935 house and they turned what used to be a very small 10 x 5 enclosed front porch into a spa like retreat.  It definitely was an adventure as we encountered many stumbling blocks along the way as one does when challenged with renovating an old home.  You never know what you might uncover including a few extra layers of floors, extra layers of ceiling and extra layers of walls.  The original design would have been beautiful but because of all the adjustments we had to make the design morphed and developed along the way and it came out even better than the original plan and I wouldn’t change a thing or the process that got us here.  Laura was fabulous to work with and from the moment we met her we felt like we had known each other for years.  She was such a joy to work with and we felt that we were always on the same page when it came to coming up with materials or ideas.  She definitely got our vision.  I couldn’t have asked for a better team.  Dale our construction guru was incredible when it came to having awesome and unique ideas that fit perfectly with not only our style but the style of the house.  We kept having to change materials and adding and subtracting things and he was always so creative but always keeping in mind the era of the house and the fact that we were trying to stay true to that and we had a great time feeding ideas off of each other with the end result that the finished product was something we can all be very proud of.  I cannot thank the team at S&W Kitchens enough for not only giving us the master bathroom of our dreams but also for making the experience one we will always cherish.

Susan & Gary Drake"
1,"Hiring S and W Kitchens was possibly the worse decision I’ve made as a homeowner. The project was started in December and was to be completed by mid-April. It is now well into August and the work has yet to be completed. I was told by Larissa Berendsen that all the materials would be ordered prior to demolition, was I didn’t know was that much of what was ordered would be the incorrect size, color, or style. My foyer tile was installed three times before they used the correct tile. Bedrooms were all painted the wrong color. The wrong interior doors were ordered. The wrong interior hardware was ordered. The wrong laundry-room cabinets were ordered. The glass panels on the custom front doors were incorrect. Hardwood floors in all bedrooms were damaged upon installation and had to be ripped out and replaced. The kitchen lights continue overheat and cut-out after 20 minutes of use. On one occasion, my neighbors called to let me know that my front doors were left wide open without anyone on site for hours. I came home to find my doors unlocked at least five times. There is a lot more, but this gives you some idea. I met with the owner, Joe Steenbeke, two months ago to address these glitches and he assured me that the problems would be addressed, yet two months later, I am without a finished home. I saved for seven years to afford a home remodel, it is heartbreaking to know that I gave my money to people who care nothing about their customers."
5,We are extremely pleased with the remodel of our master bathroom.  Working with Lindsey and Dale was a pleasure. They were very professional and even when we ran into an electrical problem that was not their fault they helped us get the issue resolved and worked diligently with our condo association to help us move the project forward. We finished within the budget and love the new look.  I would highly recommend Lindsey and S&W.
1,"I hired S&W to remodel my master bath.  during the initial meeting, I was told it would only take 3-4 weeks, then when I went to sign the contract it stated 5-7 weeks. When I questioned the time I was told by the designer ""it's in all our contracts, but it won't take that long I promise"".  Then when the job manager came out to do the first look at the bath I was told it would take the full 7 weeks.  I questioned this with the designer and he said it probably would, so he lied!  We went through not having people show up to having inferior work done.  The tub had to be removed three times due to measurements not being correct, counter had to be removed due to wrong measurements, glass around shower had to be removed due to wrong measurements.  Each time it would take another week or two to get them back out. It finally took over 12 weeks to remodel a 10X12 bath. I called the owners and never received a call back. I wrote them and never heard a word. I have other issues but will just say I wouldn't recommed S&W for any project I'm doing."
5,"The, designer, Sarah Kraus, did an amazing job of helping me design my master bathroom. She showed me the whole process from start to finish. We went over each product that was going to installed in the bathroom. Since this is my first remodel of a room, I was overwhelmed with all the steps it takes and the process involved. Sarah showed me the process and the steps it takes to do the project. Without her help and guidance, I would be stressed over the project. Sarah is a true professional in that she has the knowledge and the ability to deal with my budget of the project. I would highly recommend Sarah Kraus as a designer for either your bathroom or your kitchen design."
5,Bill Burke was our designer and he did an excellent job transforming our kitchen into my dream kitchen! I would highly recommend S&W Kitchens to anyone!
5,"Could not be happier with S & W Kitchens.  Our kitchen renovation is a total success and mainly due to the efforts of our designer, Sarah Kraus.  She stayed on top of the progress being made every step of the way and kept us informed almost daily.  Since this was our first renovation this was very much apppreciated and would not hesitate to contact her again for any future plans.  Great job Sarah!"
5,Beautiful job on my bathroom.   Great designer and superintendent.  No complaints. Left my bathroom spotless.  All the workers were top notch.  Will definitely use S & W for my next project.  Kirsten worked very well with me.
5,"Worked with designer Lola Gainer and Construction Superintendent Eric Rodeback from Palm Harbor office.  They were very professional and great attention to detail.  Remodeled a condo kitchen when we were away, as this is a second home.  New cabinets, hardware, sink, faucet, flooring, tile backsplash, countertops, under cabinet lighting and appliances.  Completed on time and on budget.  Would highly recommend."
5,I find S&W Kitchens very professional and knowledgeable about their products. The prices are reasonable. The work is exceptional.
5,"My husband and I chose S & W Kitchens to design and remodel our 1983 kitchen.  I could not be happier.  We were treated with such respect and professionalism.  Our kitchen cost approximately 77,000 dollars and it was worth every cent.  Everyone went out of their way to make this experience go smoothly and it did!"
5,"S&W did a fantastic job on our kitchen renovation. Greg Flassig and everyone involved were highly professional, knowledgeable and respectful. We were kept informed every step of the way and we absolutely love everything about our new kitchen. Would highly recommend Greg and the S&W team!"
5,"My wife and I recently had one of our residential bathrooms totally demolished and renovated. We decided to use S&W Kitchens because they are local, have a reputation for a top quality finished product, and have been in business since the 1970's. 

Also, one of the main selling points for us was the designer, Sarah Kraus. Sarah developed the layout and basic design ideas. She discussed all the menu of products, designs, prices, colors, etc, and incorporated our preferences into a final design. My wife and Sarah worked very closely to coordinate each detail. 

Sarah is very thorough. She verified all the products necessary for the job, both at the warehouse and at our home before the renovation could proceed. She communicated with us daily and was always available to us when we called. 

The project finished slightly ahead of schedule and on budget. My wife and I are extremely happy with our new bathroom. S&W provided us with a professional team and they did a very professional job for us. 

But we cannot overemphasize the value Sarah Kraus played toward making this such a great success. She built the foundation with her attention to detail, keen eye for design, and quickly developing a free and open communications with my wife and me. Therefore, we give Sarah our highest recommendation."
5,From start to finish I was completely happy with the design team and contract team from the Palm Harbor office. Kristin Phillips made my kitchen the amazing centerpiece of the house. Thank you guys
5,"Bill is very knowledgeable  in all aspects of kitchen design!  I am on the radio with Bill quite often on a home improvement show and we have had many great discussions about kitchen design, the design process, the excellent teams of installers they use, etc.  I've spoken with some of his clients and have seen some of the kitchens they have designed that are just beautiful!    If you want to speak to the most knowledgeable kitchen designers in town, S and W Kitchens is the place to call!"
5,"Greg Flassig designed the renovation of our Master Bedroom bath.  We are thrilled with the outcome.  We wanted a ""roll in"" shower to accommodate our needs in our ""golden"" years.  Greg's design was both elegant and highly functional.  Greg was also very responsive to all of our concerns as construction progressed.  Great job!"
5,"We hired S&W Kitchens to renovate our Master Bath. Sarah Kraus was our designer.  Sarah was a joy and pleasure to work with.  From the beginning she really listened to our vision, our ideas and somewhat lengthy list of desires for our bathroom.  She was able to incorporate what she heard from us, saw in our way of living and personal design, to create a gorgeous, functional and unique Master Bathroom that we will enjoy and appreciate for many, many years to come. Our vision came to fruition with Sarah's amazing skills and artistic flair. Truly a dream collaboration. Sarah and the whole team; Chris, the superintendent, as well as all of the very skilled tradesmen were there for us through the entire process.  There were a few bumps in the road, as expected in a project of this size, but they responded quickly and did what it took from each of their perspectives to correct or overcome any issues that came up. Sarah became a friend through this process and I would not hesitate to recommend her and have her design our next project. I would also like to mention that all of the people we worked with throughout this project were first rate and a pleasure to talk to and work with. Their skills were evident which shows in the end result. We have a great deal of respect for everyone who participated in our project. Although slightly more expensive than other quotes, I believe it was well worth it, as S&W stands by what they do and deliver a quality product and service. We have already had someone ask if they can rent out the 'spa'!"
5,"I hired S&W Kitchens to do a whole house renovation. This included the kitchen, the master bathroom and the guest bedroom and floors.  They did a spectacular job of transforming a pig sty into a palace.  I worked with designer Krista and contractor Tim.  They made sure everything was done either on schedule or ahead of schedule and on budget. If there were any concerns each were easily reached by phone or text and the issue would be resolved post haste"
1,"Our experience was not a positive one.  When we went in for a final review of our plans there were several issues.  The designer left out several details that were very important to us, including the wrong size upper cabinets, which created other issues.  We were very clear about what we wanted and the designer's reaction was to blame us for making too many changes.  We feel changes are part of the process and so many would not have been necessary if our designer would have listened and not continually added their personal preferences into our design.  The worst part of the experience was when trying to finalize the design for a 2nd time, we were pressured by the manager to make a quick decision.  In the end we discontinued working with them and would not recommend them as we feel they were dishonest and did not deliver what they promised."
5,"We had a 20+ year old bathroom with ugly cracking tile and a jetted tub that was never used. We didn't know know exactly what we wanted, but knew what we did not want. Kristin showed us options we did not realize were  possible.  The end result is wonderful! The construction went smoothly. S&W clearly explained how the remodel would progress. Our new master bathroom is great!
We are currently planning our next renovation with S&W."
5,"S&W Kitchens did a total remodel of my 27 year old kitchen and brought it beautifully into the 21st century. My designer, Mary Burkhammer, was exceptional and was with me in every aspect of the design and construction. The S&W crew rolled like a well-oiled machine during the entire process. They were extremely knowledgable, professional, and dependable. This was a big project (building up walls, tearing up flooring, redesigning the footprint, adding new lighting and electrical outlets, re plumbing, etc) and it was totally STRESS FREE for me from start to finish! My new cabinets are of the highest quality as is everything used in the renovation project. Floor, countertops, back splashes, lighting, appliances, hardware - all top notch.  I couldn't be happier with the final results and would highly recommend S&W Kitchens to any one who wants a truly quality company!"
5,"Sarah Kraus from S & W Kitchens designed our beautiful Jack and Jill Bathroom. We found them a very professional firm and we're delighted with the final product. The project was completed on time which was wonderful. S & W Kitchens come highly recommended by us.

Mrs Rachel Miller"
5,"S & W Kitchens just designed and installed my beautiful, new kitchen. I am very pleased with the final product. Everyone is very professional and very quick to handle all questions and concerns. And though it was tough at times to be without a fully usable kitchen, S & W made the process less painful by staying on track. They actually completed the project a little ahead of schedule (Thank you, project manager, Tony!). I highly recommend them to everyone. And kudos to my designer, Jean for her attention to style and detail. Thank you S & W!!!"
5,"S&W kitchens did my design and remodel of my 23 year old kitchen. The design was fabulous and the remodel went perfect. Krista from S&W did the design and she really knows her craft. Very knowledgeable and understands all the different aspects of the construction process. She is very attentive and when she is not available she has a very capable right hand person (Whitney) that is ""Johnny on the Spot"". Bottom line, They do what they say they will do and they do it well. We are extremely happy with the end results."
5,"Outstanding! We have nothing but positive recommendations for Lindsey Schwartz at Brevard S & W Kitchens!

It all began with Lindsey listening to our wishes, then moved on to her designing and creating our condo kitchen, master bath, & guest bath renovation. Not only did she listen to what our desires were, but added so many great practical and decorative ideas, all the time keeping within our budget allowance. Lindsey & Kevin visited our condo to get ideas of what we wanted to do for the renovation, they spent time learning what we wanted, discovering what style kitchen, baths would suit us best with our renovation. Kevin measured everything to make sure what we decided to do would work for our space & meet our condo building code.

 We replaced our kitchen & bathroom cabinets, removed some walls, replaced  counters, sinks, lighting, mirrors, appliances, removed all popcorn ceilings replacing with textured ceilings, & had entire condo painted. With this being an ocean front condo, Lindsey designed our kitchen counter with a slight wave along the edge & added wavy tile backsplash to carry on the ocean wave theme using neutral Quartz stone with tiny seashells on top of white cabinets. It is just beautiful & quite the conversation piece!

Project manager, Dale was awesome to work with coordinating the entire project & managing all of the subs, plus doing a lot of work himself. The subs were all top quality & were all fantastic, from the cabinet installers, counter templaters,  painters, electrician, plumber, appliance installer, all took tremendous pride in their work. All kept very clean work space & thoroughly cleaned up space each day when they were finished.

We felt we were in good hands with our renovation from start to finish. Lindsey did not rest until she was sure we were happy with everything, no matter how small the detail. Not only was she knowledgeable in all areas, including electrical, plumbing, cabinetry, along with kitchen & bath design, she was a joy to work with. We highly recommend Lindsey & her team!"
5,We were pleased with the plans S&W drew up for the remodeling of our two  bathrooms.  Everything went smoothly with the work.  S&W personnel and contractors went out of their way to see that we were pleased.
5,"We were looking for a full service company to coordinate the work needed to update our  kitchen cabinets and two guest baths. We are very pleased with our decision to work with Nate Schuck, our project designer, and the team at S&W Kitchens. Nate listened to our needs, provided great ideas and worked within our budget. Travis Boley, our superintendent, coordinated the activities and was quick to respond to our questions. The quality of the products and service and the attention to detail was outstanding. We had an excellent experience and would highly recommend Nate and S&W Kitchens."
5,"Guidance throughout a stressful kitchen renovation.  Excellent choice of cabinets, colors & marble and granite & backsplash. Professional installation that has held up.."
5,"I contacted S&W Kitchens and spoke to Nate.  He came to my house and previewed the remodel of our guest bathroom.  We had been having major mold problems which drastically affected my wife's health.  We got three bids, but even though they were not the lowest, I was impressed with the way S&W personnel communicated with us.  We signed the contract to completely remodel the guest bathroom with Nate and set a date to commence the remodel with Nate and the Superintendent on the job Chris Hooper.  Because of the problem with mold they moved the work forward and started construction.  We were completely happy with the results and we would recommend S&W to anybody we know who; needs work done.  To us, first comes dollar cost and then communication.  I stressed this to all three contractors.  S&W was the only company to comply and stay in regular touch with us throughout the remodel.  Again, Nate, Chris and the people that did the remodeling were all outstanding.  Everybody that worked on our home was friendly, very knowledgeable, and took great care in the work they did."
5,"My name is Jack Flemm, i am  home owner in windermere, fl. I have had the extreme pleasure of doing two kitchens and three bathrooms with Nate Schuck. Each experience was better than the last, Nate is a real pro. He has an incredible eye for design, while always respecting my wallet, even when i do not!!! seriously, Nate is willing to speak his mind and work with your ideas. the first kitchen and two bathrooms were mostly his ideas and the second kitchen and one bath were mostly mine. i love them both. 
Nate, does a great job of making you, the customer, feel comfortable, while under promising and over delivering. at the moment, i have run out of projects, but i will always remember Nate Schuck when the next one shows up. You will love working with Nate and his team, i guarantee it."
5,Our designer was fabulous-Mary listened to our needs and planned the kitchen to what we were envisioning.  Tim was our project manager- he communicated beautifully and was very willing to listen when we had concerns.  The cabinets are gorgeous and installed perfectly.  We also loved the counter tops- beautiful.  Everything that was recommended to us- delivered.  Very pleased!
5,"The S & W Kitchen designer we worked with, Greg Flassig ,was very conscientious in helping us decide what materials and colors to use in our new kitchen remodel.  He gave us plenty of options, but did not overwhelm us.  He listened to our needs and wants, and was able to incorporate some fresh and innovative ideas into our living space without destroying the uniqueness of our home. Greg was very personable and patient, even when our decisions changed dramatically at the last minute when we added extra floor tile into our family room. The whole S & W team worked well together to finish the project on time, and they continued to be available when a few details needed to be redone after the project was completed.  We felt very comfortable with all of their workers and employees.  We highly recommend S & W Kitchens for quality service and distinctive designs."
5,We just used S&W to add a bathroom and they were awesome. They made an addition to the house adding a bathroom in our garage. The bathroom is beautiful and they finished ahead of schedule. I have a newborn and they were always so accommodating. They would call us to tell us who would be there the next day and when they would be there. The room was finished several weeks ahead of schedule and could not have come out better. We are so happy that we chose them!!
5,"S & W Kitchens Remodeled my kitchen; removed a wall, raised the ceiling, new cabinets and countertops; new plumbing and electric.
The designer assigned to me was Kirsten Phillips from the Palm Harbor location. She was WONDERFUL. She really listened to me. I was not present for the construction, however, she kept me informed every step of the way with calls, texts and pictures. Everything was finished to my complete satisfaction. Kirsten and the others went above and beyond to make sure that I was happy with my new kitchen.  I do not have one bad word to say about any of the people involved with my remodel. Do not hesitate to contract with this company"
5,"S&W completed a massive renovation for me in a most competent, efficient and timely manner.  Chris Druschel and Tim Hobson were my main contacts/advisors/designers, and working with them was truly a pleasure.  The project was completed on schedule, in my absence and with constant feedback and progress reports.  The quality of product and workmanship were extremely satisfactory.  

I am completely satisfied with the final result and would recommend S&W without reservation!"
5,"Adam from the Palm Harbor location came into our home in Brooksville and enlarged as well as completely remolded our kitchen.  We had used Adam and S and W previously, so we knew what to expect.  Adam and his team were on time and ready to go.  Project took less time than expected, and came in on budget.  Anyone looking for quality work needs to go to S and W."
5,"My wife and I were looking at doing a large renovation to our foyer, living room, gallery, moving the kitchen, laundry room, dining room, and two bath rooms. We talked to several companies before S & W Kitchens and after meeting with Chris Druschel, his ideas, the store, and meeting some of the management we were sold on S&W as the best people to hire. 
Working with Chris was a real pleasure and what a great design we as a team came up with.  The project once started went very smoothly from start to finish. All of the outstanding subcontractors were very professional and Tim Hobson ( construction project manager) worked the daily problems and kept everything on track The project was finished well ahead of schedule and we are extremely pleased with the quality of workmanship and attention to details that was put into beautiful restoration. S&W and all of the people involved in this project are highly professional, very talented and a real pleasure to work with.  
A very special thanks to Chris and Tim for an outstanding job. We couldn't be happier!"
5,"Lindsey did an awesome job in translating my concepts, descriptions, and examples of what I was looking for in my kitchen remodel.  While modern is not typical in Brevard, Lindsey was excited to do a project of that nature.  

The job consisted of new cabinets, countertops, and appliances.  While no walls were moved and the basic layout was retained, it was still a fairly extensive job.  

The entire S&W team were very professional and I was always kept up to date as to what was going to happen when.  There were very few issues that came up during the project.  The communication was always timely.  Whether it was Lindsey, the job foreman, or any subcontractors, they always communicated directly and honestly when any issues needed resolving and sought my input in determining solutions.  I felt that my satisfaction was their primary goal.  

The kitchen turned out fabulous and I would not hesitate to recommend them highly to friends.  I plan to update a bath in the near future and plan to give Lindsey and S&W my business when I do."
5,"As we embarked on a major remodel of our kitchen and both bathrooms, we were quite impressed with S&W’s design and materials selection. We tweaked the plans a bit, but only to accommodate our concerns about wear and tear in the kitchen as we use our kitchen a lot. S&W quickly made some changes in the materials and we were set to go! The materials selection process was a breeze. S&W narrowed down the material selections to two to three choices; which for us design-challenged types was very helpful. If we didn’t like any of the choices, they would bring in two or three additional choices.  
Throughout the entire process, S&W was very professional. Before any work started, we had plans, we understood the costs and we understood what would happen if we ran into unexpected snags. Enduring a remodel can be challenging, but a few things that we really appreciated were:
•Everything was resolved to our satisfaction. There was never any quibbling with anything we were not pleased with. 
•All workman and subs were very polite, conscientious and always cleaned up at the end the day….and when you’re living through a remodel, that’s very much appreciated.
•S&W is very responsive to calls/emails.
The project was completed in about three months and we couldn’t be happier. It turned out fantastic! We did go slightly over budget, however that was mostly due to changes/additions that we made. Since the remodel we’ve had a few little things break or require some adjustment, which S&W attended to right away, no questions asked.

We give S&W high marks. There were no surprises on cost, design, project timing, etc. They have a great price-value proposition and they are there for you during and after the project. So, without hesitation we highly recommend S&W!"
5,"Outstanding describes our experience working with Chris Druschel of S and W Kitchens. From the design stage through demolition, construction, and completion, Chris worked diligently to bring our unique vision to fruition. The quality of the materials and workmanship was of the highest order. At no time did we feel pressured to hurry the process. Deadlines were met. We would strongly recommend Chris Druschel of S and W Kitchens for any project."
5,"We decided to update parts of our home and met Chris at S & W Kitchens.   It was a pleasure from start to finish.    We had both bathrooms and kitchen cabinets refaced and quartz counter tops in both bathroom.    The work is perfect and we were so happy we decided this year to have the kitchen counter top replaced with the same quartz we used in the bathrooms.   It had been tiled a few years ago, but after seeing the quartz in the bathrooms we could not resist completing the project by having the tile removed and the same quartz installed.   Every thing went so well,  jobs completed on time and all involved were very kind, polite and skilled.    It makes us wish there was more work we could have done."
4,"Project consisted of all new wood floors through out the house; new granite counter tops in the kitchen; new back splash; and new appliances;

The designer, Kristin, was very patient with her picky clients and in the end it was worth it. She worked with us on finding the right floor grade and stain color, granite slabs, and back splash design. The gentleman that installed the wood floors was second to none for being detail oriented, thorough, and you knew he took pride in his work. The other subs did quality work as well and knew their craft. The project manager did a good job of trying to keep everything moving towards completion.

I did not give 5 stars due to the lack of communication and it was obvious the PM had too many projects assigned. The end result was quality craftsmanship and product."
5,"Chris' response to our problem was quickly resolved.  In all of our dealings with SandW Kitchens we have been extremely pleased with their professionalism and rapid response to our questions and concerns. High quality work completed on time with excellent results.  We will use them again on our next project.
We recently had an issue with lighting but it was resolved with one phone call!  GREAT  RESPONSE AND SERVICE!"
5,"We hired s+w kitchens to do a complete tear down and build up of our 2 bedroom beach condo.  Adam Vinson of the Palm Harbor office and his crew did a superb job.  They worked carefully with us to consider all the options for flooring, paint, countertops, windows, etc and helped us make the proper selections that fit both our taste and our budget.  S+W overcame challenges with permits, condo building restrictions, and unexpected structural oddities.  The crews that worked on our place were very capable and professional.  With the completed job we have a redecorated condo unit that looks fantastic and meets our every need.  We are very happy and satisfied and cannot thank S+W and Adam Vinson enough for creating such a wonderful place to live.  I would highly recommend S+W to anyone looking to renovate their house or condo."
5,"We purchased Omega cabinetry from S&W kitchens for our bathrooms.  We love the high quality American made product from Omega cabinetry.  The S&W designers are very knowledgeable about the product, and were able to help us customize the layout, color, and design for our particular needs. With their large selection of products that they carry S&W staff was able to help us decide on the product that was right for us and our budget. The cabinets were delivered to our house in the time frame that was estimated.  My husband did all the installation of the cabinetry, and S&W was very helpful with questions he had during installation.  We will soon be doing our kitchen and will most definitely be purchasing through S&W Kitchens!"
1,"We were very excited to remodel our Master Bathroom.  It started out as just adding a jetted tub to the space and grew into our ""Dream Bathroom"" by completely redoing the walk-in shower, Vanity top, sinks, toilet and water closet, along with reconfiguring walls.  We didn't know that our ""Dream"" would turn into a ""Nightmare"".  Early-on in our planning, we found a supplier/installer for the quartz that we wanted to line the walls, tub deck and Vanity top; and needed a local Bathroom contractor for the remainder of the project.  After contacting a few local Kitchen and Bath professionals, we decided to contract with S&W Kitchens, even though their estimate was $4000 higher than any of the others.  We made this decision due to our comfort with the Designer and Estimator/Project Coordinator that we dealt with during the detailed planning process, S&W Kitchens' reputation, advertizing and the promise of a structured process with ""the Highest Possible Level of Customer Service & Communication"".

We were assigned a Construction Superintendent, who initially met with us and our Designer to go over the job, ALL details of the contract and develop a schedule.  Our job was estimated to be 5 to 7 weeks from start to completion, which based on our prior knowledge of construction practices, we thought was a little excessive, but we accepted it.

Initially the job started out as promised, with daily morning planning calls from the Superintendent, which we had requested.  There were minor day-to-day issues which popped up and were dealt with.  We understand that this is normal for construction.  However, we began to notice a pattern, starting with the quality of sub-contractors on the job.  Next the communication started to drop off.  It became a REAL PROBLEM after we made the substantial post demo payment.  The Construction Superintendent had all sorts of excuses as to why he didn't call us with a daily update, as we had requested.  Often, he didn't even return our voicemail requests for a call-back. He didn't seem to understand many of The Contract details or be able to manage the project properly.  The Superintendent consistently tried to put the blame on our Designer or others in the Company for his inability to control the job.  As our main contact on the job, we were told that it was his responsibility to understand our project and Contract completely in order to execute the job.  The ""final straw"" came when the sub-contractor to install the shower floor showed up and was NOT the original person that came out to pre-plan the installation.  They had NO knowledge of the product that we had specified. Our Designer and Estimator/Project Coordinator had researched the product thoroughly and knew that it was ""different"" from regular epoxy. The sub-contractor refused to follow the very specific instructions that came with the product, stating that ""they knew epoxy floors"".  We tried to contact the Construction Superintendent (who was not on the job site when ANY of the sub-contractors were performing), because the shower floor sub-contractor started to apply the product improperly, but we only got the Superintendent's voicemail.  So, we panicked and called our Designer to report we had a major issue on-site! Later we were chastised by the Superintendent, because he said we should only go thru him (S&W Kitchens' literature states ""our project managers, construction team members and designers are always available for any questions you may have"").  When the Superintendent finally did show up on the job, he didn't stop the shower floor sub-contractor, and he gave us his ""personal guarantee"" and that of S&W that they ""knew what they were doing and we would LOVE the finished product"". That wasn't the case.  It turned out totally unacceptable with sharp edges, uneven coverage and no slope in some areas.  At that point, we knew that there was no way that the Superintendent was credible any longer and our relationship with him had deteriorated to the point that we could no longer rely on him to complete the project. He had taken some shortcuts throughout the project, was NEVER on-site for the mandatory County Inspections (we had to walk the inspector through every detail) and had NOT adhered to the Contract requirements. We contacted our Legal Representative and sought her advice regarding our possible courses of action. We had to request a new Construction Superintendent and threatened legal action.  As a direct result, The Director of Field Operations took over our job.  A Certified Installer for the shower floor product was retained to chip-out and re-do it.  This time it turned out perfectly.  We went over ALL the missed details, issues, and Contract concerns with the Field Operations Director.  He was very professional, addressed these items, and we were finally able to get the job completed.

It's a shame that we didn't have someone like the Field Operations Director to work with our wonderful Designer and Project Coordinator, (who were both very knowledgeable and professional) from the beginning.  We might have been spared the painful experiences and anguish. The Total Project Time was 12 1/2 weeks and only then due to getting our legal representative's support and advice, not the original 5 to 7 weeks estimated.  We can only hope that if there are any Warranty Issues in the future that S&W Kitchens will stand by their Warranty.  Unlike their advertising, we were NOT ""100% happy"" with the overall process and ""The S&W Difference"" was NOT ""Simply Wonderful!"""
1,"S&W Kitchens of Melbourne, FL were extremely difficult to work with.  We hired them to reface the kitchen cabinets and install a granite counter top and back-splash. The project manager would not communicate with us and never met any of the deadlines.  We would have to track him down just to get an update.  It was a fairly small and simple project, yet it took over a month to complete not to mention the two months it took from the initial consultation to the project began.  

The project manager wound of quitting the company in the middle of the installation phase and no one from the company would return our calls. It took a couple of  visits to the showroom to talk to the manager to get the project back on track.  During the installation phase the wrong parts were ordered two different times which delayed the project even more.  Not once did anyone come to perform a Quality Assurance check of the work that had been done.  

Since the installation we have had cabinet doors fall off twice.  We come to realize that they did not secure the dishwasher to the cabinet or counter-top.  So the dishwasher tilts forward anytime the door is opened.  We have contacted the manager once again and it has been two weeks and they have yet to send anyone to correct the deficiencies or contact us as to when to expect repairs to be made.  

I would personally not recommend this company because they only seem to care about getting paid and not providing a quality product. I say this because they would not return our calls and seemed to blow us off during our visits to the showroom.  However they were quick to call if they had not received their money!"
3,This company remodeled our bathroom this past winter.  They have a new location in Tampa and we worked with the new store.
4,"Kristin did a great job on designing the kitchen. She was very helpful in suggesting ideas when I was trying to figure out how to work my cookbooks into the kitchen. in my old kitchen I stored my cookbooks across the top of my cabinets and it was very inconvenient.  She suggested the open cupboards over my washer and dryer. This worked wonderfully.  She never looked at my thoughts as ""no you can't do that"", but rather ""what if we did this"".  She helped get me the maximum amount of storage that I needed while staying within our budget. She was able to work my washer and dryer into the design of the kitchen as well."
5,"We hired S&W Kitchens to do a complete renovation of our laundry room.  From design, to demolition, to procurement, installation and completion, they did a fantastic job all around.  Chris Druschel (design coordinator) and Tim Hobson (construction superintendent) are creative, dedicated and skilled professionals who were a pleasure to work with from start to finish.  The project was completed on time and within budget as promised.  Tim and Chris kept us informed at every step of the process.  While we had high expectations going into the project, S&W far exceeded our expectations.  We could not give S&W as a whole and Chris Druschel and Tim Hobson in particular a higher recommendation.  We would not hesitate to recommend them to our friends and neighbors or to hire them for other projects in the future."
5,"Recently had a complete remodel of my '80s kitchen.  They did a great job designing the new space and all of the workmen were very professional.  The old space was gutted.  One window was removed  and the ceiling was raised to increase storage.  I now have more storage space than I have ""stuff'.  A very nice predicament.  I replaced ""everything"" in the kitchen except for 2 of the 3 existing windows.  I am very pleased with how everything turned out and the time line and cost was right on target."
5,"Bill is an exceptional designer.  He listens to your needs and offers very good suggestions.  He is detailed-oriented, which is really a plus when you know how you want to use a space but not how to make it happen.  Bill makes it happen!  This is the first part of a two-part home office project."
5,"We could not be happier with our experience with Finecraft renovating our kitchen and bath, as well as overseeing the installation for a new HVAC system.  Every craftsman was skillful, kind, and thoughtful of us as we maneuvered around them over the months of this project.  The attention to detail was impressive, and the hands-on approach of George (the owner) and Vivian (the project manager - and George's first cousin) always made us feel totally confident that we were getting our money's worth.  We recommend them without reservation.  Maryetta Andrews-Sachs and Bob Zeskind - 4920 45th St. NW"
5,"I had the pleasure of working with FineCraft Contractors on a full renovation and addition that I designed for a client in Northern Virginia.  George Papaheraklis and Vivian made a great team, paying close attention to details and quality workmanship. It is refreshing to work with a builder who has a collaborative approach and is 'hands on.' The client lived in the house during a large project and FineCraft worked hard to make that happen and ensure they were happy with the end result. I would highly recommend FineCraft as a top-notch builder to any of my clients and hope to work with them again!"
5,We really enjoyed working with FineCraft for our basement refresh. They were extremely responsive and took great care in making sure our project was done right and on time. They do a really nice job setting projects up with a team so you always know who your point person is for questions or concerns during the work. They also did a really nice job keeping us updated. We really appreciated that as issues came up (which they are always bound to do when renovating a 70 year old house) that our contractor was always ready with options as well as his best suggestion for how we could solve problems and make it work. We will definitely be returning to FineCraft for future projects and are really loving our new basement space!
5,"I’ve had the pleasure and privilege  to work of Fine craft Contractors  for a very long time. The first time  Owner and principal George Papaheraklis and I initially contracted with me was in 1987 almost 35 years ago! One can immediately ascertain that George has Architectural Training and an artistic eye merely by the way he could anticipate the next design move and and the way he can finesse meticulous details with visually graceful solutions. Our Attention to detail and the minutia are often a challenge for many general contractors but George leans into these challenges with a positive attitude and productive energy. One particular ecfample was the sculpture above the front door of our Midcentury addition and renovation.  Initially a flea market fragment, DLA's last minute detailing required stone and steel. This could have been vocalized with frustration but instead was met by George Papaheraklis with passion and has become the crowning jewel of the composition. A client once heard George saying under his breath that his quest for good construction is ""life sustaining"" for him. Since we first met decades ago, his close knit staff has  grown; in both size and professionality. One of our mutual projects was of particular challenge. However it was constructed methodically and intelligently along with  Vivian who is integral to FineCraft's efficiency, stream lined production and ""can do"" nature.  This was was no small task especially as two prjects they have worked with us on took place in the middle the pandemic. Dasha, Niko and Patrick who I have worked with personally  are all a part of the caliber FineCraft Contractors brings to the table and table saw!"
5,"We couldn't be more pleased with FineCraft! They flawlessly executed a complicated design to create a modern 'floating' porch on our 1930s center hall colonial house. All of their trades - including the mason, carpenter, electrician, painter, etc - worked together seamlessly and in lockstep to bring the project to life. We loved how George and Vivian were always coming by the house on a daily basis to answer any questions and make sure the quality was up to par. We always felt like we were up to speed on what was happening and where we were in the process. We would definitely choose FineCraft again for future projects and we are ecstatic about the work they did or us."
5,I have to say we are completely satisfied with the bathroom remodel. It met and exceeded expectations and was long overdue. I never had to question the teams expertise or competence which can't be said for every contractor in the DC area. We look forward to either working with your team again.
4,Great company--goes the extra mile.  Very dedicated professionals who do what is needed to make it right. Great to work with.
5,"FineCraft just completed a major, year-long remodel for us in Northern Virginia.  We are delighted with the quality materials, workmanship, and attention to detail.  We lived in the house during the work. You might question this choice, but with FineCraft, it worked.  We saw the same crews–not random contractors–every day.  To a man, they were friendly, courteous, and took pains to leave a clean living space at the end of every day.  George Papaheraklis was on site every few days, troubleshooting, improving, and explaining what was going to happen and in what order.  The house looks great and is easy to live in.  We got more than expected and at a fair price."
5,Consummate professionals! Easy to work with and would recommend these guys to anyone who wants a high quality and professional job!
5,They did my addition and were excellent. Shout out to Chris who was always so kind and professional and always available when needed!
5,"Finecraft prides itself on attention to detail, and indeed this was our experience throughout the renovation project (a kitchen and sunroom upgrade that opened interior space without modifying the exterior footprint of the house). To make our lives much easier, they built a separation wall between the work area and the rest of the living area and reconstructed a temporary kitchen on the main floor in the living area, so we were able to stay in the house during the construction. This made a big difference during the forced home-based work due to Covid pandemic. The staff left the place in good shape each day before leaving. At the end, they did not hesitate to come back several times and in a timely manner to complete the details remaining on the punch list. We love our new space."
4,"FineCraft has done two significant projects for us - a major terrace remake four years ago and now a total kitchen renovation.  We are very pleased with their workmanship and the ease of our working relationship.  On several occasions, they have taken extra steps to please us."
5,"We were converting a two story great room into a second floor with new bedrooms, as well as renovating our kitchen and a bathroom / laundry room.   With a baby on the way our timeline was tight - no room for delays - and Finecraft not only delivered but exceeded all expectations in terms of reliability, craftsmanship, and staying true to the estimate.   We were out of town for most of the project and were able to communicate effectively with the team via mobile app and/or Facetime.   Once we were back in the house, Rosendo and his team were very respectful and friendly (and kept everything clean!), and responsive to any and all questions or minor issues.   Would hire them again for any project.   Very pleased with the final result as well as the process.  Thank you!"
5,"Finecraft did an excellent job, our addition is beautiful and they were nice to work with.  We had a few hiccups along the way, but they were quick to fix."
5,We have had the pleasure of working with FineCraft on a handful of projects. They are attentive and responsive to both clients and fellow professionals. We look forward to future opportunities to collaborate with the crew at FineCraft.
5,"It has been a pleasure to work with the Finecraft team. They have great communication, responsive and their attention to detail is top notch! I am looking forward to future projects with Finecraft!!"
5,"Finecraft did a fantastic job on our renovation -- we highly recommend them. Thanks to all the staff, but especially to Rei for shepherding the project through on the site. We were consistently impressed by the level of craftsmanship and attention to detail that went into the project. We can't thank the team enough."
5,"We had a great experience with a Finecraft from start to finish. Their professionalism, attention to detail and flexibility were remarkable. Our project turned out even better than expected, at a very competitive price. We are delighted!"
5,"Once again it was a pleasure working with George Papaheraklis and the Finecraft team. This project was very sophisticated, involving creative building challenges which Finecraft easily met. George always adds both value and Grace.

5,It was a great team that worked diligently and cohesively to deliver a new beautifully detailed and elegant two-family home on Capitol Hill!
5,Fantastic experience! We just love the team at FineCraft Contractors. We have used them for two renovations at our house and will use them again. Their customer service and professionalism are outstanding. We absolutely love the finished project and would recommend them to any looking to do work on their home.
5,"We hired FineCraft to renovate the basement in our 1958 split-level home.  It was important to us for the project to create a more functional living space that was still traditional enough to match the rest of our home's interior.  They did a terrific job - followed the architect's plan to the letter.  The quality of the work was top-notch.  In fact, the WSSC inspector thought the work under his purview was the nicest he'd seen.  The members of the construction crew were polite and professional.  George has a fine aesthetic that clearly carries through to all of the work done by FineCraft. The workmen who laid the tile, particularly in the bathroom, are truly artisans.   It is a lovely space, and we could not be happier.  I'd recommend FineCraft to others who are considering a remodeling job."
5,"We have done the remodeling of a bedroom (with loft + stairs) and a bathroom.
We were very pleased with Finecraft and I would highly recommend them.
This is a team of high professional with a very friendly staff. Everybody in the team has some specific expertise and are managed by a project lead. Though, the company is not too big and you can feel that this is a family business company and that they care about project."
5,Working with Finecraft was a very rewarding experience for me. The company worked well with my architects and executed all aspects of the project in a professional manner. I look forward to working with them again!
5,Our screen porch has a wow factor.  Finecraft took the architect's plans and turned them into a gorgeous and functional room.  The craftsmanship and attention to detail is apparent in every aspect of the construction.  They stayed within the specified time and budget constraints.  It was a pleasure to work with all members of the Finecraft team.
5,"We went through a long process of selecting a contractor for a remodel of our home on Capitol Hill. We are so glad we chose the fine people at Finecraft. The moment we interacted with them, we knew that there was chemistry. It was a long project with many customized flourishes that were unique and challenging. The Finecraft team did an incredible job and delivered our dream house. Their professionalism, attention to detail and overall team work made for a stress free journey through the construction. If we had to do this again, we will do it in a heartbeat. 

Thank you to the entire Finecraft team - Specially Jose and Dasha."
4,Enjoyed working with this team. Very professional and worked hard to minimize disruption to our family during construction period. Quality of work was stellar and communication was excellent.
5,"This team of professionals has an amazing ability to see what it is you want to create.  I have worked with this team in the community many times and when it came to getting a bid on my personal project, I knew they would not disappoint us.  Finecraft came, was on time listened to our ideas and then really looked at what we had to work with and created a plan that would work in our family budget.  They also gave us plenty of referral projects to go look at and customers to talk to for references.  It's not like, here are 3 people, its years of happy customers.  Their attention to detail and craftsmanship on their projects was what sold us.  Quality and excellent follow up."
5,"Finecraft Contractors, Inc is an absolutely first-class organization. Their name suits the quality of their management, personnel, and workmanship very well. They are true professionals in every sense. During the course of our home elevator construction and installation project, my wife and I got to know the Finecraft management and craftsmen team very well. We have only the most complimentary things to say about their courtesy, creativity, flexibility, and project management and execution skills. We highly recommend Finecraft Contractors, Inc to anyone who is looking for a superior home remodeling contractor."
5,"Finecraft did a wonderful job on this project.  In particular, their craftsmanship, timeliness, and attention to detail were admirable.  We look forward to working with them on Phase II of the project."
5,"We have now worked with Finecraft on a number of remodeling projects in the DC area.  They are a highly professional and skilled Contractor that produces quality craftsmanship and on time project delivery.  As Architects, we have found Finecraft brings value added ideas to the project whether it be product recommendations or if an issue is discovered how to solve it. We would highly recommend Finecraft to our clients."
5,We hired Finecraft to build our screened-in porch on a recommendation from our architect and overall were very pleased with the project.  The quality of work was very good and their team was professional and courteous.  We would absolutely recommend them for similar projects.
5,"Finecraft Contractors is a top quality operation. I have done multiple renovation projects with George and his team, including bathrooms, kitchen, addition, terrace, and in-law apartment. Finecraft has a great sense of aesthetics, great attention to detail, and the construction site is left impeccably clean every night. That's why I am a return customer!"
5,"Finecraft contractors is a well rounded professional company in the DC area. 
Their crew is highly skilled and the staff has superb customer service. Every project we have seen has exceeded our expectations. It is hard to find a building company with such high attention to detail. Working with the Finecraft family makes your experience enjoyable and gratifying."
5,"I have worked on several projects with Finecraft. They are an excellent company to work with and have a pleasant and knowledgeable staff that will always make client communication, service and quality their to priority!"
5,Finecraft did an excellent job renovating our garage and converting it into a gym. They were prompt in their reply and finished the project in the time they quoted which is huge! The price was reasonable and the staff was very responsive throughout the whole process. I highly recommend them for any home renovating project and will be using them again in the future!
5,"I hired Finecraft to handle a gut renovation of an 1890s townhouse in downtown Washington, DC. The property was an absolute mess and had been abandoned for 20 years. Finecraft were able to retain the front facade while constructing a new modern home with what was left of the old bones of the home. It turned out beautifully and is true to the architect's design. It was delivered on time and mostly on budget. I would recommend them to any other property owner in similarly situated historical/renovation jobs."
5,"As an architect, I'm naturally very protective of my clients with regard to contractor selection.  With Finecraft, i know that my clients are in good hands with a professional, honest, and thorough contractor.  Their work speaks for itself in terms of quality craftsmanship, and they are a delight to working with.  Communication is one of the most important parts of client management, and Finecraft clearly excels in this department. I would strongly recommend Finecraft to all of my clients no matter what type of project we design."
5,"We could not have imagined a better renovation experience! Everyone at Finecraft was a pleasure to work with from the owner all the way to the project manager, employees, and subcontractors. All were extremely nice, friendly, attentive, and with tremendous attention to detail. You could always contact them with a question and they would get back to you very quickly to explain or help. 

They did a great job on the addition of a mudroom, expansion and creation of a new open floor plan kitchen/family room combo, moving of a bathroom, renovation of two other bathrooms, and replacing the entire outside, including roof, windows, siding, patio, walkway, and portico. 

They completely transformed our house into a brand new property and we could not thank them enough. They were exactly on budget and on time, with no delays even though we substantially expanded the scope of the project. They were able to change gears smoothly and efficiently as our ideas evolved through the course of the work. They worked around our busy lives with 3 small children and were able to create a fully functioning mini-kitchen to allow us to stay in the house during the work.  Highly recommend them for your renovation/addition needs."
5,Finecraft did an extension on my historic house and it really is beautiful! George kept me in the loop about how it was all going. The team were efficient and respectful of my property and the problem-solving on the best way to get it all done was excellent. I would highly recommend this company.
5,"As both architect and client, I was pleased with Finecraft Contractors. I found the crews to be hardworking and pleasant. With our project, George took a hands on approach from beginning to end, and collaborated well to help create what we envisioned for our home."
4,"Generally quite pleased with our experience with Finecraft.  We hired them to complete a three story, 900 sq ft addition (plus some renovations to the existing space) in our NW DC home originally built in 1932.  They worked well with our architect, and showed consideration and willingness to work with us throughout the process, and were responsive to the minor concerns of our neighbors.  We were able to stay in our home throughout the project, which was completed (though punchlist) in less than 6 months.

In particular we found the quality of their carpentry (everything from floors, decking, exterior, closet work, trim) and paint to be outstanding.  We were very impressed, and received lots of compliments from friends and family.

Two areas I'd suggest clients keep in mind; first, as with almost all contractors, their approach to project management isn't to the same standard as with full service design-build firms.  You'll want to be proactive on communication about timelines, and confirm everything in writing (either emails or text.)  They are great at honoring commitments, but sometimes memories aren't perfect, and it's helpful to have a record.

The second area, related to above, was with the electrical work.  We did change things up a bit, but even with that, I wasn't super happy with the electrician.  Some of the work could have been done to a higher quality, and we had to tussle a bit him to get what we wanted; in a couple of cases the project wasn't done exactly as we wanted.  That could have been prevented if we did a better job documenting and holding them to what we discussed.

That all said I'd definitely recommend them.  Friendly and flexible, quality workmanship, and great price."
5,"We hired Finecraft to repair our master bathroom after the discovery of a leak and mold.  The Finecraft team was very professional and a pleasure to work with.  They listened to our concerns as well as our ideas and came up with recommendations that fit with the design.  They have a great network of suppliers and we were able to find great deals on tiles, fixtures and granite."
5,"After a year of discussions with our architect and Finecraft over the renovation of our 1920s colonial, we decided to go from a one story addition to a three story addition. George patiently addressed numerable questions raised by my detail -oriented husband. We lived in the house during the eight months of renovation, which enabled us to closely examine the outstanding craftsmen at work. George regularly came up with creative solutions to maximize the functionality of the space within our budget. When my husband and I disagreed about anything, we could always rely on George's professional vision and diplomatic resolution.   My serotonin levels would rise each day when I saw George and Vivien arrive in the red pickup; they inspire confidence.The Finecraft team is committed to excellent craftsmanship in a timely manner. We enjoyed working with them immensely and would love to do another project with them soon."
5,"Finecraft Contractors is by far, the most professional, caring, competent company we have used to work on our home. They completely restyled our 1940's Cape Cod 1st floor, as well as completed other outside improvements with magnificent results. From start to finish we always knew what was going on with our project. All of the folks on the project were absolutely the best - and they all stayed on the job until it was finished. As with older homes there are usually surprises when making changes to the floor plan. Our team anticipated those possibilities and problem-solved with us to accommodate our wishes. We felt that Finecraft truly cared about us, our needs, and our home and we could not be more pleased. We truly feel part of the Finecraft family!"
5,"Tess Moran and Cabinet Discounters have worked with Finecraft Contractors on many projects.  Finecraft can always be counted on for beautiful craftsmanship, excellent project management and top notch customer service."
5,"Fisher Lumber has been working together with Finecraft Contractors for four decades, They perform first class, detailed workmanship. If quality is what you want in your home improvements...look no further"
5,"I am an architectural designer based in LA, and my parents live in Rockville, MD.  Though they were in need of some basic home maintenance repairs as well as a kitchen renovation, they were completely intimidated by the construction process and didn't know where to begin.  Finecraft was recommended to me by a reputable architecture firm in Maryland, and it was a very smooth process to get everything completed on time and on budget once they were provided with a scope of work and design, even from across the country.  My parents are now thoroughly enjoying their kitchen makeover and new, non leaking windows."
5,"We were the architects for a complete 2nd floor remodeling job in Rockville. The project included the complete reconfiguration of the master bathroom and bedroom as well as moving the laundry closet into a new laundry room. We recommended Finecraft to our clients when they asked us about a trusted contractor. Often times it is risky for an architect to recommend a certain contractor but with Finecraft we have no hesitation. I know they will be professional, honest and if selected do a good job that is in line with the design intent.
I highly recommend them for your home remodeling projects."
5,Professional company with a very personal touch.  High quality work- You truly get what you pay for!  I feel confident every time I refer them to friends or clients.  They earn & keep the love & trust from their clients because they are passionate about what they do.  Can't say enough wonderful things about this company & leadership!
5,"We hired Finecraft to perform a remodeling of our townhome third floor. It was a significant undertaking as every room was impacted by the remodeling, which involved the renovation of the master bathroom, second bathroom, creation of a laundry room, expansion of closet space in the 3 bedrooms, creation of 2 linen closets, and renovation of the half bathroom on the main floor. Finecraft was recommended by the architect who designed the plans of the remodeling, as he pointed out the quality of the work performed. We ended up hiring Finecraft because they were interested by the project and they wanted to work with us. In comparison with other general contractors we interviewed, their pricing was very competitive. Overall, the project lasted 2 months. Our family of 4 lived in the house while under renovation, the workers were very accommodating and respectful of the circumstances, and most importantly very clean in consideration of the work performed. What we are the most pleased with is the quality of the work and the details in the finishes. They fully enable the vision we had for this remodeling. Even though we wish that there was more clarity on the agreement, better communication with certain change orders, and more flexibility with the allowances, we are very pleased to have chosen Finecraft. The functionality of our new layout and the beautiful bathrooms are now permanent features of our new home, working with Finecraft worth every single penny. We also referred Finecraft to friends who have subsequently hired them for their project needs."
5,"Top notch service!

After meeting with over a dozen contractors, we found Finecraft to be the perfect fit for our renovation.  They performed the work within the timeline specified and ensured we didn't exceed our budget.  The crews showed up Mon-Fri at the same time and progress was made each and everyday.  Although we (the customer) made a number of mistakes, Finecraft was patient and understanding, ensuring we were satisfied every step of the way.

Overall, we would recommend anyone use Finecraft for their future renovation needs.  I never wouldn't of imagined I would ever be so happy with a contractor's performance, but here I am, writing this review.  If your a stickler for exceptionally high quality work without having to pay ridiculous prices, go with Finecraft, it will be worth the wait considering their high demand."
5,"We have been working with Finecraft Contractors for a while now and have had a great experience - we are stone fabricators and they send us their clients to choose their countertops. They are professional and helpful to ensure their clients needs are met - whenever we need specific information about about a job, they always make sure everything is correct and we are on the same page on every project. As a sales representative, I know how important it is to communicate with the client - especially if there is a contractor involved. 
We definitely recommend  Finecraft for your house renovation and look forward to working with them for future projects."
5,Finecraft is just terrific. Their staff is friendly; their work is meticulous and the did our project on-time and within budget.
5,I have had the pleasure to work with Finecraft on several projects. They are a family owned and operated business who takes pride in their work as well as delivering a remarkable experience to their clients.
5,"Finecraft is an unusual combination of exceptional talent, fine craftsmanship, delivering more than expected and with personal touches that would make any home remodeling or home construction project a dream for the owner.  On time, on the ball, on target and on top of the project from start to finish.  It's been a pleasure to attend the open houses to discover the range of services and beautiful outcomes."
5,"Mario worked on two separate projects at my home.  One was an outdoor window that needed to be rebuilt the other removing an old bar area and replacing it with a closet.  Mario was efficient, polite, fairly priced and provided outstanding workmanship.  I'm using him again this month for yet another project.  I highly recommend him!"
5,"I am an Interior Designer and I had the pleasure of working with Finecraft Contractors, Inc. because my client was doing a major renovation, and Finecraft was doing the remodel. 
My experience in working with them was professional, cordial and efficient.  It seemed that our mutual goal was to make sure that our client  got what they wanted to their utmost satisfaction!
I treat every client like I would want to be treated...................and that's what I saw in Finecraft Contractors, Inc. as well!  Keep up the professionalism and quality of your work!!!"
5,"I have found Finecraft to be a very professional company, who focuses on customer satisfaction and delivering a superb product above all. From first contact to finishing the project, Finecraft is friendly, professional, and genuinely cares. The project turned out beautiful and better than I expected!!"
5,"We hired Finecraft for three projects that included remodeling our kids bathroom from a single user to multi user setup, refinishing our basement, and creating a built-in bookcase/fireplace/TV wall for the master bedroom.  All 3 projects turned out great.  The team working on the projects where there every day, and they staffed resources accordingly - so some days it was 2 guys, and other days there was up to 5 guys depending on what needed to be accomplished.  All projects where completed within the time estimate, and on the agreed upon prices.  Their construction staff all wore corporate tee-shirts, and where professional and careful of cleanliness and the surrounding spaces.  While I think it is hard to determine a low cost provider for these types of services, value is more important.  And Finecraft delivered that, as well as adding a designer to take our project visions into reality.  We have more work to do, and will hire them again."
5,"We hired Finecraft to renovate our late-1890s row house in DC, including putting in a new kitchen.  We were very pleased with the work done by Finecraft.  George and his team were able to create a kitchen that has all of today’s modern amenities but still has the charm and finishes consistent with the age of the house.  The craftsmanship of the cabinetry and molding is beautiful.  They created plaster molding in the kitchen that matches the original molding perfectly.  Beyond the kitchen, the Finecraft team carefully restored the walls, molding and floors back to their original glory and updated our powder room and foyer tile.  The work was done timely and within budget.  And, the Finecraft team was responsive to our questions and requests.  We would recommend them without reservation for any type of renovation – from new build to restoring an older home."
5,George and his crew are complete professionals with and eye for details. The additions to our house by Finecraft are high quality and very well constructed. I highly recommend them for any project.
5,"We were set to hire another contractor when we met George Papaheriklis of Finecraft Contractors, Inc. Not having any experience remodeling or hiring contractors and after hearing some of our friends’ experiences we were very weary and nervous about the whole process. George’s openness, demeanor and patience answering all of our questions and concerns put us at ease in no time. Needless to say, after just a few minutes we knew we have found our contractor. The experience overall was great and the end result fantastic. It was not without its ups and downs, but during the process George and the Finecarft’s crew were very patient, diligent and most of all professional. They addressed all of our requests and made sure we were completely satisfied with the end work; not an easy feat when dealing with a self-professed perfectionist. An inch to the left or to the right was not an issue; they worked very hard to make us happy. George was very hands-on throughout our project and was available anytime there was a question or concern. He was very candid and willing to explain things to us both regarding the scope of work and the costs involved, especially on those pesky change orders (our own requests). Because of his background in architecture, George offered suggestions and made changes that made things just right, going so far as to doing things just because they will look better, no change orders. We were living in the house while the renovation/addition was going on. Finecraft not only provided us with a temporary kitchen, complete with a sink and running water, while they did the work, but they were very accommodating to our needs and timing, made sure everything was clean at the end of the day and took every possible precaution to avoid dust and debris coming into our living space. Many friends have commented on the craftsmanship and quality of the work. Most of all, Finecraft stands behind their work, they have been prompt and thorough in addressing all those little and no so little things that sometimes pop up on new construction; nothing has been too big or too small for them to come and fix. In the end, what matters most is that George and the Finecraft’s crew has our gratitude, respect and above all, trust."
4,"We contacted Finecraft for a smaller project in the summer of 2016 based on the Houzz reviews. They contacted us back very quickly, but because we had a tight deadline, Finecraft were not able to do the project themselves, but recommended one of their sub-contractors called American Trademark. AT renovated a small master bath for us on a very short deadline and completed the project in just over 2 weeks. The process went smoothly and we got the bathroom we wanted. They cleaned up at the end of each day and kept the mess to a minimum. The team was professional and met the deadline and stayed within budget. After completion, we noticed that some paint in the stairway to our second floor had been ripped off probably when they removed the paper that had protected the stairs. Not a big job to have fixed, but the reason what I did not give the full 5 stars."
5,"We hired Finecraft Contractors, Inc. for a third floor addition to our row house in Washington DC.  We would highly recommend Finecraft as a contractor.  We were very happy with their work.  In addition, they were responsive, answered our questions and concerns promptly, and went above and beyond to make sure the project was completed to our satisfaction (including the completion a number of added change orders along the way and completing punchlist items)."
5,"We contacted Finecraft because one of my coworkers had used them for 2-3 projects and recommended their work.  Niko and Chris came to the house and looked over the kitchen.  They immediately made some useful suggestions about the design for our new kitchen.  Niko put us in contact with a first rate designer.  We visited Appliance Distributors Unlimited (ADU) after seeing the listing on the Finecraft website.  We worked with the designer and a representative from ADU through several iterations of design, cabinet selection and appliance selection until we had a design and set of appliances that we liked and that fit within our budget.  The good folks at Finecraft got to work on Tuesday July 5th and finished on Friday July 15th.  They had told us it would take about two weeks, meaning 10 business days, and it took 9   Most of the work on the kitchen was done by one worker, Moses, and his assistant.  The work was extremely well done.  Moses is a true craftsman.  He is meticulous and he knows what he is doing.  There were several points along the way at which we had to make decisions about routing wires, the vent for the hood and other things.  We were given the opportunity to participate in the decision making where it was appropriate to do so.  All in all, we are very satisfied with the final product.  I would be very happy to have Finecraft do other projects, such as our master bathroom, especially if Moses or someone else with similar skill is involved."
5,"After interviewing several other local contractors, I hired Finecraft to relocate our master bathroom to the window line to permit natural light in the bathroom.  We also created a master dressing room (closet).  I was so impressed with their work that I expanded on the assignment to include several other projects.  I truly enjoyed working with George.  He is delightful to work with.  George comes up with excellent/creative ideas to solve issues, while being sensitive to cost restrictions.  George was personally very involved in our project from start to finish and he went over and beyond many times.  The construction workers who were in our home were very respectful of our home and cleaned up every day.  They were very accommodating and did an excellent job.  FineCraft cared very much about our project and ensured that we were satisfied.  I am very pleased with the project and FineCraft and highly recommend them."
5,"We recently completed a magnificent kitchen and renovation project with Finecraft and we could not be happier. George and his team brought their fine workmanship and attention to detail that made all the difference in producing a finished product that exceeded our expectations. George was very hands-on throughout our project and made himself available anytime there was a question or concern.  Because of his extensive background in architecture, George worked well with our architect and other vendors we used to complete our project. The entire Finecraft team was extremely professional, responsive and truly a pleasure to work with.  I would not hesitate to recommend Finecraft to any homeowner interested in doing a renovation or building a brand new home."
5,"Finecraft did a fantastic job on remodeling my bedroom and bathroom. The work crew was tremendous -- talented, courteous, professional, on time. The design staff was very helpful in helping me with decisions on color, selection of materials and decor. They were very accommodating and a pleasure to collaborate with."
5,"We have worked with Finecraft Contractors, Inc. in several projects now and it we must say their work is 5-star. In addition to their quality and superb customer service, they are a joy to work with. It's rare to see first hand a construction company that stands behind their word and delivers with such abundance. The Finecraft team truly cares for they clients and goes the extra mile to make sure they are happy and satisfied with the project. Looking forward to more projects with them."
5,"My wife and I downsized to a condo. The location of our new condo  was exactly what we wanted but the interior of the condo was not. We decided to gut our 2,000 sq.ft. condo and  construct a very  modernly designed one. After much searching,  we and our designer chose Finecraft as the builders. We presented  precise plans, which had a number of unusual features.  Finecraft did excellent work: details of the construction were carefully attended to; they arranged for material to be brought from Portugal, Japan and elsewhere; they were flexible in accommodating some changes we made as the construction went along. The configuration of our glasswork was unusual in shape and size, but  the work of Finecraft in managing to actually bring the glass into the condo and install it  was truly impressive. 

The cost of the project was what we had agreed to. The project took a little longer than expected. But this was because of the severe limitations our condo association placed on the times when work could be done  and the convoluted  rules and unpredictable inspection scheduling  imposed by the Fairfax County building inspection bureaucracy.

Finally,  the President of Finecraft, George Papaheraklis,  kept a keen eye on the project's progress, as frequently present  and responded quickly to any questions we had.   We highly recommend Finecraft."
5,"Finecraft did great work for us, and when we had issues arrive, they were quick to rectify them. We are very appreciative of there attentiveness."
5,We recently had two bathrooms updated by Finecraft in our 1930s Glover Park house and could not be happier with the process and results! From the beginning Niko and his team excelled at communication - whether it was Niko checking in to make sure the work had begun on time or Chris (our project manager) letting us know what work would be done. We were impressed with how hard their team worked to make sure the project was complete before our planned move-in date. Every time we went to the house to check on the progress the team was working incredibly hard and were happy to show us what had been completed that day. We are already planning to use Finecraft again for future projects!
5,"In February 2016, Finecraft renovated our family room.  The owner sketched a preliminary drawing based on our desire for light and warmth, and provided a ballpark cost estimate.  We discussed the options and details, and finalized the plan and cost estimate with the caveat that we could be flexible with the artistic plan and the cost if and as needed. The big decisions were made prior to beginning the work.  We were guided to a door company to select a door and a stone company to pick out surround and hearth stone. To make a more expansive family room with plenty of light, they knocked down a wall; installed a window that matched the other two windows already in the room; built bookcases with storage cabinets; a window seat with drawers, and a closet; installed a wood floor and ceiling lights; updated the fireplace from a brick to stone façade with an inset for a flat panel television; and replaced a sliding glass door with a double French door.  The crew arrived on time each day, completed the work assignments, and cleaned up at day’s end. The crew was friendly, professional, and not intrusive. In fact, they were so trustworthy that we provided access to a key for flexibility such that we were not dependent on their work schedule.  We were contacted at the end of each day with a summary of what was done, what would be done next, and what we, as the homeowners, needed to decide or go pick out in the week ahead, e.g., paint color, cabinet door knobs.  The crew even moved large furniture in and out of the work space so we did not have to do so. Overall, our experience with Finecraft was extremely positive. The work was done within schedule and budget. We have worked with Finecraft on previous renovations, large and small, and will do so again.
The crew at Finecraft are true professionals, well trained, and skilled such that they act independently and do not require direct supervision."
5,I had the opportunity to work with George and his crew on a number of different home renovations ranging from small remodels to full bottom to top demolition through renovation.  In all instances I found the crews to be pleasant and hardworking and fully in alignment with George's vision for the final product.  George takes a very hands on approach to all his projects from the beginning to the end and works very well with his clients to create exactly what they envision for their new home.
5,I have worked with Finecraft in three different projects and I find them very professional and detail oriented. I am a designer with many years of experience and worked with a lot of different contractors. Gisela Interiors
5,"I contacted Finecraft from California after seeing a picture of a bathroom that I loved on Houzz, they answered the phone when I called and emailed me all the information I needed within 24 hours.  They really were wonderful.  Much appreciated for helping out!!  5 Stars for awesome customer service!!"
5,"After interviewing and getting bids and references from 10 different recommended contractors, we hired Finecraft Contractors to excavate and gut renovate our basement and they did an exceptional job.  They worked with us to make my vision come alive, and their attention to detail and workmanship exceeded my very high expectations.  The Finecraft team was reliable, respectful, and responsive, and they finished ahead of schedule and on budget.  I would 100% recommend them."
5,"We had Finecraft remodel our kitchen and family room from July 13 - October 13, 2015. Every aspect of the renovation was a positive experience. They said it would take three months, and they were done basically three months to the date they started. The quality of work was superb and it was easy to get in touch with either the owner or foreman throughout the entire project. We will definitely use Finecraft again!"
5,"Finecraft Contractors are the best.  Their workmanship is top-notch and their workers are all experts in the respective fields.  They are a fantastic crew.  We are pleased with our additions and changes which will enable us to stay in our house as we become less mobile. We now have a beautiful custom-made roll-in shower and other bathroom changes that enable a person in a wheelchair to use the bathroom. This was a tricky undertaking because of the configuration we wanted. Most importantly, the owner, George Papaheriklis, listened to us and made sure that the construction was perfect,  He consulted with us all during the construction."
5,"Fine craft Contractors lives up to their name, Fine Craft!   Their leadership and crew were 100% and superseded all expectations.   I highly recommend hiring Fine Craft if you want true quality work, professionals who are passionate, honest and efficient.  A true headache free experience.   

Thank you Fine Craft for everything you have done for me and my family!  
Michael"
5,"I am an Architect and worked with Fine Craft for a complete home redesign/renovation project. I happy to say that the project was a success. Fine Craft Contractors are very professional, detail oriented and incredibly responsive. They exceeded my expectations and would recommend their services to my clients for their future construction projects. They follow the design through, completed the project on time and exactly as it was planned."
5,"I am an architect and worked with FineCraft on a kitchen/ family room renovation.  Their
work is excellent and high quality with attention to detail.  The project was finished within the timeline projected.  I enjoyed working with George Papaheraklis, as he is a master builder with many years of experience, has a good eye, and brings great ideas to the project.  My clients also enjoyed working with George and were very excited about the end product.  I highly recommend this company and look forward to working with them again!"
5,"We recently completed a large remodeling project in partnership with Finecraft Contractors, Inc.  The project encompassed a large, high end Kitchen and two baths, including the Master Bath.  George Papaheraklis and his fine crew are a pleasure to work with and have a keen attention to detail.  No request was too small and every team member was respectful and professional.  The end product turned out exactly as we had designed it, plus George made some wonderful suggestions along the way which were executed in the overall project.  I would not hesitate to recommend Finecraft to my design colleagues or homeowners looking for a quality project!  George is highly professional, easy to work with and his team is dedicated to their craft and always strive to achieve the highest level of client satisfaction."
5,"I have used Finecraft Contractors, Inc. on several occasions and I highly recommend using them on your next project.  Finecraft does very high end work with prices that are reasonable compared to the industry.  The management team, their organization of projects, keeping customers informed, happy and satisfied before during and after the project is complete is the best.  I will definitely continue to use them and will refer them to anyone in need of a good contractor."
5,Great Contractor to work with.  Very professional and worked well coordinating scheduling for a smooth installation.   High quality work and attention to detail.
5,"Finecraft recently renovated our kitchen.  Not only did they provide us with a temporary kitchen, complete with a sink and running water, while they did the work, but they were timely, professional and skilled in all they did.  Their attention to detail elevated the project.  Our kitchen has been transformed.  We are extremely impressed by their efforts."
5,"I hired Finecraft to build out a previously unfinished basement, reconstruct a front porch and a side porch and replace all of the shutters on our house's façade.  Finecraft did a tremendous job.  The workers were professional, worked quickly but with high quality and there was always great communication so I knew what activities were going to occur and when.  We actually had an unforeseen waterproofing issue with our foundation which Finecraft addressed quickly, provided an effective solution and executed the fix at a very reasonable cost.  It was a pleasure to work with Finecraft and I cannot recommend them more highly."
5,"Finecraft Contractors, Inc.

We completed a kitchen/family room renovation for our 40 year old home.  We met with  three contractors and received three quotes.  From design support to workmanship and quality, we were pleased with every aspect of our experience with Finecraft.   After  seeing a Finecraft renovation in the neighborhood, we were sold.  

The entire team was professional, clean and respectful of our home.  It is never easy to live through a kitchen renovation but George and Niko went out of their way to make the process easy for our family.  Without question we would recommend FineCraft to friends and family."
5,"Finecraft was recommended by our architect for a major renovation to our house (expanded and remodeled kitchen, family room and master bedroom ans master bathroom, as well as some other updates).

The workmanship and attention to detail was outstanding.  Finecraft was very responsive throughout the project, they provided good ideas and suggestions, they cleaned up very thoroughly throughout theproject.  The project manager was excellent and they clearly take great pride in their work.

We had done another major renovation several years earlier in a former house and we wish that Finecraft had done that one as well, because there was no comparison in the quality and management of our earlier project with the one that Finecraft managed.

I highly recommend Finecraft for any home renovation or construction project."
5,"We are first time home buyers and have never dealt with home renovations. Our house was in decent condition at purchase but needed a serious facelift throughout - we hired Finecraft to renovate the majority of the house, which meant new bathrooms, kitchen, new drywall pretty much everywhere, electrical, etc etc. They did an excellent job guiding us through the process (their site manager was particularly good, always calm, easy to talk to). They handled hiccups in the schedule and work plan very well, and had really good suggestions for improvements throughout the house (removing parts of walls, design ideas for custom cabinetry). Overall, excellent experience, and we are thrilled with the results. Highly recommend."
5,"Late 2014 through spring 2015, FineCraft undertook a major reconstruction of our backyard terrace, plus improvements to the inside of our house.  Outside work included: new retaining walls with extensive foundation improvements, extensive drainage improvements, blue stone paving, tree pits, trellis and wood slat fencing, new lighting, redirected and reinforced stairways, and removal of sunroom parapets.  Inside work included: two skylights, two new windows that required breaking through the existing structures, installing lighting fixtures and ceiling fan, and completion of requested small tasks.
 
Being a project limited to a small area, detail design and execution were critical.  We employed The Kurylas Studio as project architects.  Kurylas Studios recommended FineCraft as one of several contractors.  FineCraft’s expertise with architecture and attention to detail proved critical to the project success.  As a real team effort, FineCraft working with the architect and us, made several valuable design alterations.   They rebuilt one retaining wall rather than repair it and for a second retaining wall, they used traditional brick facing rather than ¼ inch brick facing.  Both company owners and the project foreman were professional, respectful, knowledgeable and easy to work with.  When we disagreed, their professionalism always led to quick resolutions, which all parties felt good about.  Impressive to us was how fair FineCraft priced change orders.  Not only are we satisfied, the whole team is proud how the project turned out."
5,"We hired Finecraft a few years back when we were planning a major renovation to our home. We had completed a similar renovation in the past on a previous home and the difference between our first experience and this one was like night and day. From the very beginning, George, his foreman and the crew were professional, responsive, worked quickly and efficiently and got the project done in the time estimated. We lived in our home during the renovation and the Finecraft crew showed up on time EVERY time, did the work each day and cleaned up!! after each days work. We had the same foreman for the complete project and he reflected George's and Finecraft's values of professionalism, attention to detail and pride in craftsmanship. During the process, George would review the upcoming work and make sure that all the details were taken care of. Their workmanship was superb, the fine details that speak to master carpentry and pride in workmanship are evident throughout the project. We have lived in our home for 10 years since that work was done and it still looks as good today as it did when it was newly finished. We recently needed some repair and remodeling done to another part of our home and we didn't even need to go out to bid - we just hired Finecraft again. You will not be sorry you chose them!"
5,"Finecraft Contractors, Inc. is an excellent company! The staff are very professional and efficient. I was so impressed by their work. The quality and design of their projects are some of the best I've seen in this industry. I would gladly work with them again!"
5,"This was my first experience working with George of Finecraft, He is a professional who listens, asks intelligent questions, and proposes great solutions based on his years of experience in the industry. The quality of Finecraft's work is high, and the staff is friendly and responsive. I strongly recommend George and the Finecraft team."
5,"Finecraft built an addition and new outbuilding, designed by my firm, for one of the more finely-detailed late-19th century homes in the town of Kensington's historic district. The owners chose Finecraft because they wanted to match the quality of detail and workmanship that had sold them on the house in the first place. The end result did not disappoint. Finecraft performed at a high level of professionalism and the quality of their workmanship was superb."
5,"Finecraft has been in the area for 30+ years now and has demonstrated time and time again that their company stands for quality. I can say this because I've seen their work firsthand and I've followed them for many years now. I simply love their work and their quality. They stand by what they build no matter what. It goes without saying they really care for the houses they build and for the homeowners they collaborate with. 

As a homeowner, it's important for me to know that I can rely on the contractor I hire. I can say without a doubt that I can rely on Finecraft to follow through and produce a quality product without concern or hassle. Once you find this type of relationship you never want to let it go. 

Having a good contractor is one thing. Having a great contractor that you can work well with, that has good communication skills, coordinates well and who you can build a fine working relationship with is quite another experience. 

It goes without saying I'd recommend them without a doubt.

5,"I am very impressed by the spectacular new home Finecraft has constructed on Durbin Road in Bethesda.  The exterior & interior exhibit an exquisite & spacious design, & it is a welcome addition to our evolving older neighborhood."
5,"Claude C. Lapp Architects has recently had the pleasure of collaborating with Finecraft Contractors, Inc. on a renovation and large addition. The experience has been outstanding. George & Niko possess wonderful communication skills that guide projects along without a hitch. Their knowledge and passion for the industry are ever-present through every phase of construction. 

Over the years, we have been lucky to have worked with many of the area’s finest builders and contractors. Finecraft ranks among the top from our perspective. We look forward to working with them in the future."
5,"As a 25 year old Company, a window supplier such as ourselves have worked with thousands of remodelors locally. Finecraft Contractors have stood the test of time having more than a 20 year relationship with our company. This clearly speaks to the way they handle themselves professionally & work closely with their clients. The level of quality that they deliver every time ensures their future. Great companies such as this stay strong and busy making their Clients dreams become reality. We look forward for another 20 years & more."
5,"The details and craftsmanship in the work by Finecraft Contractors is exquisite. Being an Architectural Photographer, I see a lot of houses on a daily basis. I'm very impressed with the close attention to detail and the quality of the work that Finecraft has put into this beautiful house. It's truly a work of art and I'm excited to photograph more of their work."
5,"This project involved the complete renovation of the second and third (attic) floors of the back wing of our historic home, to create a master bedroom suite (with full bath and 2 walk-in closets), laundry area and linen closet on the second floor, and two bedrooms and a full bath on the attic floor.  It involved creating 2 new dormers and a new gable on the attic floor and installation of new windows.  Considerable upgrading of joists and rafters to meet modern codes was required in this historic home.  Great care was taken to ensure that all changes were consistent with the historic nature of this home, including custom-milled moldings and use of antique recovered heart pine flooring, among others.
Finecraft did an outstanding job on this project, as they have in previous experience with them on other projects on this property.  They took exceptional care to get the details of the finishing right.  The same experienced workers were present for the entire project.  They listened careful to any questions or concerns we had, and consulted frequently with us as the job progressed.  They were highly professional at all times, and it was a pleasure to have them in our house (we remained resident in the rest of the house throughout the renovation).  Their proposed cost for the project was reasonable, and the job came in at the agreed price, and we agreed to some minor change orders as the work progressed.  The project took about 6 months for completion, which was somewhat longer than anticipated but not unreasonable given the structural work involved.
Overall, I have the highest recommendation for Finecraft for their professionalism and the quality of their work, from their initial comments on the design and detailing through demolition, construction and finishing, to the final clean-up.  It was a pleasure to work with them and I recommend them unconditionally."
5,"They are my favorite! They always seem to make things right. Even when things are tough they work through them and the outcome is always amazing. They have worked on several projects in my house and all of which are excellent products which reflect the level of detailed work that epitomizes Finecraft. From smaller projects to larger ones, from my experience, I can guarantee they'll leave you satisfied with the job you contract them for, hands down!"
5,"Finecraft says it all! What an amazing company. Their detail to workmanship, customer service and setting the standards for quality standards all across the board is what they are all about. George the owner of the company sets the standards for perfection in all the building and project management and Niko sets the standards for customer service and high end marketing using the latest technical tools to stay up with the newest building trends. Their team members hold to all these standards which make it one of the best remodeling companies in the area. I would highly recommend Finecraft to anyone looking for a company to take care of all their building needs and to any architect or design firm that would like to collaborate with their services. You can't go wrong in working with this company.

5,"Finecraft provided on site inspection of 11 wooden window frames, including a bay window in the front and on the side of our townhouse.  They identified the areas with water damage, developed a scope of work, and provided an estimate for replacing the damaged wood with a PVC product.  Their estimate was far and away better than those provided by the other two contractors.  They then proceeded to compete the scope of work over a four-day period.

We were impressed from the beginning with the professionlism, customer relations, and communication with Finecraft.   Niko, their office manager/supervisor was very communicative, as was Mario the primary carpenter/repairman.  Mario and his co-worker, Henry, did a great job on all of the windows, some of which required a complex scaffold set-up.  The results were excellent.  We can now be assured of the integrity of those 11 window frames.

I will use Fincraft again and recommend them to others.  They did excellent work for us."
5,"Finecraft has done numerous projects in my house, including the installation of hardwood floors, staircases, bathroom renovations and the installation of French doors. Their work was impeccable, their estimates to the point and their timing on target. One of the few companies that both the owners and the workers have integrity on their business transactions, put the customer above everything else and perform the work seamlessly, even when there are problems.
They recently completed a deck Gazebo that the the jewel of my deck and house. As in the other projects, their work was impeccable, on time and professional."
5,"Finecraft recently renovated our basement family room, bathroom, and bedroom.  They transformed a boring, dark, subterranean basement into a beautiful light-filled, walk-out family room.  In addition to renovating the bathroom and upgrading the bedroom, they also created a project room.  The results are stunning.  Their organization and attention to detail resulted in a large scale project that moved smoothly, despite involving the skill of several tradesmen, all of whom are on staff with Finecraft (no subcontracting challenges).  We could not be happier with the results!"
5,"I have had the pleasure of working with the professionals of Finecraft Contractors, Inc for several years now. I have seen many of their stellar products in working with them. I believe the staff of Finecraft work very hard to ensure that the high quality of service they deliver is really conveyed by their marketing so that their prospective client knows what they have to offer. It is the quality in their service and in their projects which is stressed from the project manager to their marketing director and it shows."
4,They are very good with their job but expensive. They have great staff too! Be sure to specify anything you want for them if not you wont get it e.g if you want a bathroom be specific with every single detail you want in the bathroom down to the smallest detail like soap holder if not you wont get it. If you have the money and you desire a good job done call Finecraft!
4,"Great work, with nice attention to detail.  The workers were tidy, thorough, and professional.  Lovely design, over and above architect's rendering."
4,"Since the early 1990's, I, an architect, have teamed up with and worked on many fine residential projects all around the Washington, DC, metropolitan area, including my own house.  George Papahericles, the owner, brings great passion, honesty and energy to each of his well crafted projects."
5,"I've been following Finecraft Contractors, Inc. online for several years now and the work that I have seen is just absolutely outstanding. I so wish I could have them come down to Florida to work on my future home. The quality of the work is just top-notch and if you are looking for the best product and service, I'd highly recommend Finecraft! I've had the honor of meeting several their employees and they're such a pleasure to be around and they are very hard-working, reliable people. Like I said, I would hire them in a heartbeat."
5,"Finecraft Contractors recently completed the construction of my design for a garage with guest suite above.  The project was small but George Papaheraklis and his team gave it their full respect and attention. They were knowledgeable, detail oriented, and a pleasure to work with; I look forward to our next project together.

5,Finecraft has done some of the best quality jobs I´ve seen.  The company is composed of truly valuable people who deliver a fantastic product and a good experience.
5,Finecraft Contractors successfully completed 2 remodeling projects for me this year.  Total window replacement and renovation of 2 bathrooms. They completed the work on time and I was very satisfied with the outcome.  I would recommend them highly to any potential customer.
5,"We have collaborated with Finecraft on several projects and have been impressed with their integrity, client commitment, as well as the overall quality of their work.  Each of these projects were medium sized renovations with very complex design details.  George and his team always try hard to please the client.  We look forward to working with them again on future projects!"
5,"Finecraft does excellent work!  Extreme attention to detail
George has a very good eye and is very accommodating.
His crew have been with him for a long time.  That
iIs very important to me as an Interior Designer.  A 
Company is only as good as the people who 
work for them.  I highly recommend Finecraft Contractors."
5,"My first experience with Finecraft Contractors was when my clients selected George Papaheraklis and his team to complete the construction of a large renovation we designed in Chevy Chase.  From the meetings prior to the start of construction it was evident that George and his team have a high attention to detail.   

Having Finecraft’s experience to work through changes and modifications in the field made the process a lot easier for the client and myself.  I was continuously amazed with the depth of skills within Finecraft and their ability to self-perform a lot of the work in this whole house transformation.  I look forward to working with them on future projects."
5,"Finecraft built an addition on our home in 2006 and we asked them to renovate our kitchen which was just completed and is beautiful.  They are exceptionally focused on detail ... we had a need to adjust the design of the project mid-stream and they undertook the change without   complaint and at no extra charge.  They are easy to work with, reliable and courteous.  You just have to get used to the hammers going at 7:30am because they work a long hard day."
5,"House build in early 1970s. Contempoary design. We acquired in 1977. Project was from 5/2011 to 11/2011. We had some specific ideas at outset, like remodel kitchen and baths, but more general undeveloped ideas for other improvements, like consolidating a small unused balcony room into a walk-in closet and enlarged bathroom. We moved out for 3 months. We never had any issues with Finecraft Contractors in clarity of work, the  timeliness of completing projects , or billings. We did not use an architect or interior designer. Instead we relied upon Finecraft to recommend enhancements we did not see or think about, which was a brilliant decision on our part. Finecraft (George in particular) had the ability to visualize a change which could be made to enhance a rooms appearance, and in many instances with little added costs. For example outside windows for an expanded master bathroom, or remaking a large outdated family room with a cathedral ceilng into a  dazzling room. We would recommend them without exception and use them again. It was indeed a pleasant experience. We continue to enjoy to this day their work"
5,"As a kitchen and Bath designer with 25 years of experience, I have worked with many different contractors.  Finecraft is one of the best that I have ever worked with.  They are true professionals and make all of my designs come to life for our clients.  I have hired them to do work on my own home and would not hesitate to recommend them for any project, large or small."
5,"As an Architect, I've had the pleasure of working with Finecraft Contractors and been able to count on George Papaheraklis' experience and knowledge on a couple of occasions.  Finecraft Contractors' work embodies the company's name in as much as the end result of their labors can truly be qualified as fine craft. George's and his crew's professionalism is apparent from the planning stages to the execution of the final punch list. I look forward to collaborating in the future with George and his firm and would recommend his services to our future clients at  plan Z  a r c h i t e c t s."
5,"Finecraft is an excellent home builder and home remodeling general contractor in the Washington, DC region. I have worked them them on at least 10 significant projects over as many years. What sets them apart are 4 strengths:
1. Their commitment to be faithful to the design created on paper and   not deviate from it without sufficient cause.
2. Their commitment to maintain a customers trust and confidence with them during the course of the work.
3. Their technical expertise makes for an enjoyable building process.
4. Above all else, their ability to finish a project strongly and completely. Customers naturally expect this but it is not all that common in the remodeling industry. It takes a highly committed professional general contractor that is adequately compensated to achieve this."
5,"Owner George Papaheraklis is close to finishing our second project.  One was demolishing a kitchen and family room, and making a single space with a ""bump out"" for a breakfast area.  Neighbors who know our community are amazed when they see it.  We have now gutted an old-style bathroom, vanity area and modest walkin closet and are making a larger integrated bathroom with a bigger walk in closet.

What distinguishes George is that he is an artist with a keen eye.  Not only will he tweak an architect's plans for aesthetic and functional reasons, but even as the project is in midstream, he is consstantly thinking, ""perhaps we should do it this way (a frame around tiling) or switch a regular door to a pocket door or change the orientation of the stall shower glass door. He obsesses about little details and, in the long run, that makes a big difference.

I found out about Finecraft in the house of a friend where George had gutted the back of the house and added on to it.  I had no doubt about the big picture and the attention to detail.  If any reader could see a typical Finecraft project up close, he would not have to rely on ramblings like this---he would see the work and know all he needs to know to hire the company."
5,"Finecraft Contractors completely revamped our family room.  Tore out old dated paneling, and 'popcorn' ceiling.  Now it is not all chopped up looking and it is calming to look into it.  Also they made custom bookcases on the sides of the fireplace that have ample storage below and great display space above.  I'm very pleased with the results and the respectful people who came into our home to do this work."
5,"Finecraft is an excellent construction company and a pleasure to work with.  George Papaherkalis has an excellent sense of design and constructions, his crews are skilled, and the final product is enjoyable space to live in.  I have hired them five times over 25 years and would use them again."
5,"Finecraft is an excellent company to work with.  Honest, reliable, creative, dependable and of course the attention to all the details are second to none, The crew are hard working and respectful. George is an inspiration and works so hard to come up with the best possible solutions for his clients.  The team thinks creatively and out of the box which is so unusual.  This is especially important in an historic renovation where sensitivity to the integrity of the house is key to bringing it back to life.
I would highly recommend 
George and his team."
5,Finecraft built us a brand new home from scratch and I could not have been happier with the work.  The attention to detail was outstanding and they were so nice and communicated so well with us throughout the process.  I would highly recommend them to anybody.
4,"When I work with George and his team of builders, I know that the final product is going to be beautiful.  He gets the details right, he understands our design goals, and he puts his heart and soul into the work.

5,"I have worked with Finecraft Contractors as a supply and design resource, on many projects over the years. George is very creative, exceptionally thoughtful, and he listens carefully and intently to the needs of his clients. He makes each project collaborative and enjoyable - always with the goal of getting the best result for his clients. He stays current on the latest in design and material possibilities, with a particular passion for quality construction. I would highly recommend George for any of your construction and design requirements"
5,"I am an architect that has worked with Finecraft on several residential projects and they do an excellent job.  Their craftsmanship and attention to detail is superb.  They are able to think in architectural terms and their sense of design and aesthetics is very reliable.  Their management of the construction process is well thought out, and benefits from years of experience.

On the contractual side, Finecraft is very good at negotiating the cost of a project, providing valuable input for economy and buildability without cutting corners.  

I find the whole Finecraft team a pleasure to work with.  I am happy to serve as a reference if necessary, and prospective clients may contact me at Studio One Architects (301.946.4601).  Robert Smith, Principal."
5,"I hired Finecraft to add a sunroom, new roof, portico and remodel 2 bathrooms. The work has been excellent with a foreman present at all times. The workmen are pleasant and helpful. They adhere to the highest standards in their work and I recommend them without reservation."
5,Finecraft built our house in 2012.  They did great work.  Really cared about our project and our family and it showed in the final project.
5,"I had the pleasure of hiring Finecraft for a project recently that called for the addition of an outdoor living area to my home. The level of detail and commitment to quality was unsurpassed. These are Craftsmen, not contractors.
It shows in every project they create.

5,"We had Barron do a complicated addition and remodel that added a bathroom and expanded the footprint of the house. No, they definitely were not the least expensive bid we got on the project. But they did really nice work, mostly on time and within budget (we expanded the scope of the project midway through, which added to the final cost and completion date). We were nervous going in, because friends of ours with similar or even smaller projects would complain about things taking much longer than promised and being ghosted for days by their project managers.

Fortunately, that wasn't the case with Barron. Leeran, the project manager, was very communicative and flexible, responding quickly to questions and issues while helping us stay within budget and make the most of what we could spend. Thanks to the company's willingness to work with us, we were able to stay in the house during the majority of the project — it wasn't easy for the construction crew to work around us (and our furniture), but it saved us a lot of money and allowed us to splurge in areas that were important to us.

We did run into a few problems along the way, but Leeran was very responsive and got things fixed or re-done quickly. As worried as we were about ballooning costs, unpleasant surprises and the project dragging on and on, I can't say enough how pleasantly surprised we were.

The addition is beautiful and the house is much more functional and enjoyable. (And our teenage daughter is thrilled to have her own bathroom.)"
1,"I'm very unhappy with my experience with Baron. We worked on a 1000 sq ft remodel that took over a year when it was originally quoted for 3-6 months. Months after, I'm still trying to clean up the mess they left me with and the damages they made to my house. It was a headache and complete stress working with them. They are the nightmare remodel that I hear others talk about. Our project managers did not remembered anything that was discussed and there was little to no follow through. They would say they were going to do something, or that this is how it would look, but then when it's done it's completely different and not what was discussed. Every meeting with the project managers ended up being pointless. I had to escalate many issues to the main office, and the owner, Mike, in order to get some type of acknowledgement, explanation or answer. HVAC was installed incorrectly, exterior hole in the wall was not repaired correctly, crew did not know how to install our cabinets, incorrect measurements which affected cabinet order and window order which was not returnable, patio furniture used as work benches, patio and yard used as a dumping ground, etc. We were the points that had to point out the issues and then argue with them to get it resolved when these are very simple things that should just be done correctly in the first place. Follow the manual, follow what city inspector expects, etc. I can't imagine the customers who don't know any better and assume things are okay when there could be bigger issues caused to their house in the long run."
5,"Finding a contractor that does quality work and is reliable is rare. My husband and I decided to remodel  90% of my childhood home and after meeting with six contractors, it was clear from the beginning that we wanted to work with Leeran. He was always prompt to our meetings/calls, explained things in an easily digestible manner, and was honest. 

This project was insanely important to my family as we had a lot of memories in the old home and the Baron crew created a new, modern home for us to make new memories in with our toddler. Leeran was one of the big reasons why our project got done on time (especially impressive during COVID) as he was extremely responsive. Anytime we had a question or needed his advice during the project, he was there to help answer questions, explain the timeline, help facilitate and project manage timelines with the crew/vendors, etc. 

We also worked with Noya, one of their interior designers, and she was so sweet and helpful in designing our home. She attended multiple meetings with us to understand our design aesthetic, shop with us for finishes (kitchen, tile, countertop), etc. 

I have been recommending Baron the entire time we’ve been working with them. Their work is top notch and having a PM dedicated to your project is a game changer. My husband and I are working parents with a toddler, so it was less stressful and not as overwhelming having Leeran help steer the project for us."
5,"I had a great experience working with Leeran and the Baron constructions. Our project was based in Sunnyvale while we were living in San Francisco with a less than two year old toddler, in the middle of the pandemic. We were redoing 2/3rd of our home which entailed large structural changes. We knew this wasn't going to be easy and we wanted to go with the best in the area. 

For day 1, Leeran and the firm were punctual, outright honest and very collaborative making them one of the most dependable contractors I've ever worked with. In the early days, I remember brainstorming layouts with Leeran late into the night over zoom. He was always very accommodating, open to creative ideas and sharing this experience to keep the project feasible. When it came to quotes, while Baron was a bit on the higher side, I knew I was going to get what I'm paying for. So we decided to go with them. 

The project had a very tight deadline as our lease in SF was ending in March and we were starting this project in early October. Leeran stayed on top of it throughout. Even when there were hiccups like when we found out our ducts needed to be replaced and one of our structural beam was infected with termites, Leeran added more workforce instead of pushing out the finish date. Leeran has a fabulous team of people he works with. From the architect to the designer, everyone was such a pleasure to work with. From finalizing permits to ordering finished materials, everything was so systematic and well planned that I'm afraid I'm spoiled for life. 

The final product of their work was above and beyond my expectations. When I shared the photos with my friends and family, I had to convince them that they are not photoshopped. (Checkout out the Kitchen & Bathrooms Design & Remodel project from Sunnyvale)

I highly recommend Leeran and Baron Constructions. If I had to do it all over again, I'd go with Barons again."
5,"We started working with Baron Construction this year on a multi-stage project and we are about to complete Phase I of it - a full Kitchen/Living room remodel to a modern farmhouse. Leeran is our Project Manager throughout the project.  Overall I am very happy with the work so far and how the new Kitchen / Living room area is shaping up.

Like any renovation project there are surprises and complexities you encounter along the way - and while not everything always goes according to original plan, I truly appreciate working on this with Leeran - we are able to work through it together, evaluate different ideas an options and were able come up with reasonable solutions to all problems along the way. I also appreciate the completeness of the work and ensuring we get a higher quality finished product which meets code - Leeran ensures the work is done right above everything else.

I look forward to continuing our work together in Phase II of the project."
5,"They rebuilt our shower to exacting specifications. We are in love with the resulting artwork, which is sturdy and beautiful. I highly recommend the services."
5,There is a lot of unethical behavior on the part of the staff. They do not respond to calls and don't care about the customers. I had a very bad experience!
5,"This company's service is overpriced, and their staff is unprofessional. It is a shady business and I regret choosing them. They have been refusing to give me a refund for two weeks. The service has been inconvenient for me."
1,"BUYER BEWARE - If you are thinking of hiring Baron Construction (Or, David) to do any major work - think twice! The company is a complete disaster and incompetence. They don't understand architectural or structural plans or even care about doing so. 
On their website Baron Construction claim that ""We are LA's premier Design-Build Contractor with over 55+ years of combined experience."", but their presence in the SF Bay Area is a mess.
Their approach is to sign you up for a high-premium contact, and then hire half-cost subcontractors and provide zero supervision to any work. Subcontractors do whatever they think, sometimes not even up to Code, with zero guidance or supervision from GC. Subcontractors make costly mistakes, for which Baron Construction will charge you. Subcontractors damage expensive finishing materials and nobody at Baron Construction takes responsibility! Don't bother. Take your money somewhere else where you will get quality, communication, and responsibility. We hired Baron Construction to build our dream home, and with the project still unfinished, it turned to be a nightmare all way along. Baron Construction had promised us completion in 9 months but turned it into over 2.5 years project. We had no choice but to fire Baron Construction and it took other General Contractor a long time to correct all mistakes Baron Construction and its subcontractors had made."
5,"Have you ever envisioned and dreamed of improving your home?! We have for a very long time! And with the help of a talented Baron team, and great delegation by Sean, the project manager, we’re now living in our dream home! Despite many setbacks this year, due to pandemic, Baron team made our vision a reality!"
5,"We hired the Baron team to turn our historic San Jose craftsman house into our dream home and could not be happier.  It was a major project, including converting an unfinished low-ceiling basement into permitted living space, an addition to the main floor, and rebuilding most of the structure while keeping some of the original redwood bones and craftsman charm that other builders didn’t want to touch.  Ron and Eli have been with us every step of the way, from architectural drawings and shepherding plans through the city, to major excavation and framing, now to the last finishing touches.  Whether Baron employees or hired subcontractors, everyone on the job has done top notch work and displayed pride in their craft.  Big shout outs to Salvador the framer for stopping at nothing short of perfection and to Courtney the interior designer for helping turn our ideas into a reality beyond our dreams.  We will be raising our family in a beautiful home and creating many memories for years to come.  Thank you Baron!"
5,"Our home was built in the 1950s and needed some major work.  What started as the wish to add central heat turned into a entire home remodel with the help of Baron.  We bid out several companies for plans, and Ron was personable, kind & asked great leading questions.  He returned with three options (Good / Better / Best) and provided the reasoning behind them all.  He was knowledgeable of the requirements of our city, plus had great suggestions on how to better our ideas.  

In the end, we ended up adding 400 square feet, plus brought the entire home down to the studs.  We updated everything - from the roof, to plumbing, to electrical, to the stucco around the house.  The end product is absolutely gorgeous, and we are thrilled with the work that was done.  

The project completed on time - and although over budget, it was due to unforeseen circumstances (lead / asbestos) and beautiful add ons like our newly vaulted great room ceiling and front of the house upgrade.  The on time portion was essential though - as with SIP starting due to COVID-19, we were able to return to our home from the small apartment we were staying in.  Ron kept the team on schedule and pushed hard to ensure we could come back ASAP.  

I highly recommend Baron - especially Ron as the PM on the job.  Between his ability to keep the project on schedule, and Courtney's amazing eye for interior design - we are proud to have our kitchen & master bath featured on Baron's website: Home Expansion & Renovation"
5,"Very professional, prompt, and they do great work! Highly recommended. Obi was always reachable by phone and responded promptly to all queries. Extremely pleased."
5,"We remodeled our 30-year old kitchen and appreciate the job that Baron did.  We especially appreciate the work of Obi, the Project Manager, who kept track of the various sub-contractors and their schedules.  As with any remodeling project there were hiccups along the way, and his sense of humor and commitment to quality helped us a lot.  We love the finished product."
5,"I used Baron for design & build for a master suite (bedroom & bath) addition on my house.    They did a great job.  The quality of work was high and they worked through a number of unexpected challenges that popped up along the way.  The project took a bit longer than originally expected, but very happy with the final results."
5,"Baron is great to work with. They are respectful and responsive and their work turned out great! They have experts in lighting, plumbing, etc."
5,"We worked with Baron Construction and specifically project manager Ron Hogen to remodel our 120 year old Victorian home. It was a long and complicated project, that was basically a gut job for a significant portion of the house - involved a completely new kitchen great room (relocated the kitchen to a new part of the house), laundry room, bedroom, 3 bathrooms, butler pantry, finished basement and more. Now as I sit in my beautiful new and sparkling kitchen great room, I can whole-heartedly recommend Ron and Baron Construction for your project. Looking back on our project - yes there were ups and downs, and some challenges, as you would expect with the extent of our project, especially given we lived in the house through most of it. However, Ron maintained open communication and transparency throughout. He was dedicated, responsive, and accommodating. Their price was extremely competitive, and in the end they finished very close to the original bid, (most of the change orders were initiated by us). We are happy with the quality of their work, and they didn't close the project until all the final minor adjustments were perfect. We will be calling them for any future projects."
5,"I was very pleased with baron construction, especially Etel’s project management. She was very professional and accommodated our quick turn with this remodel. She was attentive with my concerns and responded quickly with questions. If something didn’t work, Etel went beyond to do the research to figure out a solution. I would recommend Etel to anyone."
5,"My wife and I needed one of our bedrooms completely re-built (flooring, ceiling, walls, insulation, painting) AND we wanted to completely renovate the attached bathroom. For starters, I will admit I am extremely particular. I scheduled consultation appointments with 5 contractors, all of which had great reviews on Yelp and other sites. From prior personal experience and friends' experiences with contractors, their reputation on the street is not that great (poor communication, lack of timeliness, etc). After all the consultations, I decided to go with Baron Construction. For the record, they were not the cheapest, but their offer was fair and I felt good about our project manager, Leeran Shlomo. Our project is now complete and I have to say I feel very good about selecting Baron Construction and Leeran Shlomo. Leeran proved to be anything other than the contractor stereotypes I mentioned above. He was personable, friendly, a GREAT communicator, and he made himself available almost anytime (even before 8 am and up until 10 pm at night sometimes). His customer service was superb. I would highly recommend Baron Construction and this is almost directly attributable to our experience with Leeran Shlomo. The project manager can make your life really smooth or miserable. Leeran managed our project extremely well and kept us updated almost daily. If you can select Leeran, I would highly, highly recommend him! He's awesome!"
2,"Never gave them the contract. Just too expensive. Got 3 more quotes from licensed and bonded contractors and trust me they were 8 times more expensive. 
Maybe they are good at doing fabulous job but I’ll settle at 95% great job at 1/8th the price. 
2 stars for the “project manager” who was patient, spent time to understand needs."
5,"My husband and I decided to renovate our kitchen. After getting some estimates, we decided to choose Baron construction. This job included removing a wall, two fireplaces, all cabinets, countertops and appliances and then installing new fireplace, cabinets, quartz waterfall island, quartz countertops and backsplash. 

Every construction project has some hiccups here and there, ultimately it's the end products that count. We are very pleased with our new kitchen and fireplace. The quartz for the island was cut and installed wonderfully. Wow factors are definitely there.

An incremental payment schedule was provided. All changes during the project were itemized and approved by us prior to work. We paid as various stages of the work were completed.

Overall, We are happy with the way our kitchen turned out and we could not be more pleased with Baron Construction and all the products of their team's work."
5,"My project manager, Lital, was beyond fabulous.  She was both professional and personal.  Professional in every aspect from start to finish and yet personal in the way she listened to me and put my wants and needs at the forefront.  I would absolutely call her again if the need would ever arise.  Cant say enough good things about her and how she handled my project."
5,"We just completed a complicated kitchen remodel and full bath remodel with Baron Construction.  The project was completed on time, actually early, and for the most part within budget.  There are always a few surprises with a project dealing with an 80 year old house and constraints imposed by our first major remodel a number of years ago, not to mention current building codes.  Our project manager Eli and his assistant Obi where wonderful to work with and the Baron’s management model is unique and ensures positive communication and rapid problem solving throughout the project process.  Further, the actual work did not start until all critical decisions were made and key materials in place or their delivery date assured, e.g. new kitchen cabinets.  This was essential to project timing and minimizing our disruption. 

In addition, the on site construction crew was amazing.  They were there every day, as promised, and a pleasure to have in our house.  Fernando is a master craftsman and even the Palo Alto building inspector told us (in front of Fernando) that he was an amazing builder who did everything according to best practices and worked to perfection. He solves problems and is so conscientious. What a prize Baron has in Fernando....and those who work with him as well. 

Our new kitchen cabinets had to to fit exact specifications for a variety of reasons and this was very important to us.  Eli and Obi did meticulous measurements and the cabinet makers did an excellent job as did the installers, Marco and Carlos.  They worked hard to have the cabinets just perfectly placed. They were true perfectionists. 

Eli and Obi were more than fair in listening to our requests and satisfying our needs.  They worked around our schedule to insure work timing was handled correctly.  And, when the few problems did occur, the Baron’s team was on top of them and they were resolved to keep the project on track and meet our specific needs. 

The contract for the work was fair.  The only real issue for us was that the allowances were somewhat low.  We went over because we selected more expensive products. We would encourage more generous allowances with the contract budget adjusted accordingly. 

Overall we could not be more pleased with Baron Construction, their management team and all the products of their full team’s work.  We are thrilled with our finished product and would certainly use Baron again. A big Thank You!!!"
5,"Baron rebuilt our shower to exacting specifications after a previous tile replacement done with another contractor failed just like the original tile.  The resulting work is sturdy and beautiful, and we couldn't be happier with the results.

We had the pleasure of working with Eddie on project management and Lucas as our foreman.  Both Eddie and Lucas were very prompt, professional, and knowledgeable.  Any time we had a question, they were available to answer.  Although it didn't have any material effect on the job, we also really enjoyed just chatting with Eddie and Lucas when they were around.  Everyone we dealt with felt warm and genuine and it made the whole process a lot more pleasant.

Now, the work wasn't cheap and we did have some overruns on time estimates, but nothing outrageous.  When something would go longer than expected, Eddie always kept us in the loop as to why.

All things considered, we would absolutely use Baron again and would recommend them to anyone who's willing to pay for great craftsmanship."
5,"Craftsmanship at Baron Construction is world class!  We had the pleasure of working with project manager Ron who worked with us from project definition all the way till the everything was fully completed including the professional power wash to remove any type of debris on the drive way.  Ron was with us every step of the way throughout the project and was always super responsive via phone/email/txt.   In addition, Ron always came over to check-in with us to ensure we're happy with the progress and accommodated to our busy schedule by coming in later in the evenings after we're done with the kids' dinner.

We contacted Baron in Dec 2017 when we purchased our home and wanted them to update 3 of the bathrooms.  After a walk through of the existing bathrooms, measurements were taken and we received a formal detailed quote.  The 2nd best aspect (the best being their quality of work) of working with Baron is how they never nickle and dimed us - what we paid for the project was exactly what they quoted at the start + fair adjustments due to us adding wet-walls in 2 of the bathrooms (which we didn't want initially when we started the project).

The only criticism we had with Baron is the length of time it took the finish the bathrooms. We were originally told it'd take 3-4 months and it ended up taking 6 months.  Part of that is our fault because we had guests over and had to stop construction for a couple of weeks which caused downstream delays. The wait was well worth it because the masterful work of Sergio (who does tiles) was simply amazing.  Overall we were extremely happy with the way the bathrooms turned out so we just wanted to take a few mins to acknowledge their amazing work here on Houzz!"
4,We recently had our bathroom remodeled and hired baron construction. Everyone was professional and courteous. We were very happy with the results and would recommend to others.
5,"As a Realtor my responsibility is to my clients. When my sellers wanted to do improvements to their investment property in preparation for Sale we chose Barron Construction for the job they were AMAZING! they took all the headache out of the renovation they acquired the permits,offered insight to the design and materials and even when we hit budget snag they were able to accommodate Eli and his team were super professional and skilled. The property sold before ever hitting the market while under construction and was over our target price all cash 7 day close. Everybody was happy. Will definitely call on them when I have another project. And so should you."
5,"I interviewed Mike Baron, owner of Baron Construction & Remodeling Co, to remodel my ranch style home to an up to date open concept look. I knew within 10 minutes that this was going to be a good working relationship and I was going to hire his company for this project. The first thing that impressed me was I had a long list of things I wanted done and he glanced at it, put it aside and just listened to my ideas. We did a walk through the house and the first thing he noticed was the foundation in the TV room was sloping and needed to be replaced. This was not on my list but he recommended this be my first priority and I’m glad I agreed. The moldy musty smell that was plaguing me disappeared and the floor is now even. 

I was fortunate to have Mike work with me on the whole project. As a client I appreciated the consistency and confidence working with one person and helping with the design and selection of materials. This was very important to me and high on my list. I also appreciated working with the same onsite people when possible.

The scope of the project entailed new wood floors, crown molding and baseboards throughout the house. A beautiful custom fitted cabinet under a wall mounted TV with matching floating shelves in the front room. 

The entryway into the kitchen was enlarged to give it the open concept look I wanted. The kitchen was enhanced with a quartz countertop, sink, beautiful backsplash, shaker cabinets/drawers and hardware.

Replacing the old brick with natural stone and a streamline mantle changed the existing fireplace.

The master shower was gutted and replaced with a decorative mosaic tile strip, large complimentary tiles for the shower walls and bathroom floor, frameless glass shower doors and an infinity drain. The mosaic tile was also used as the backsplash behind the bathroom sinks and an area behind the toilet. 

The interior walls were freshly painted with an accent wall in the living room and TV room. The exterior of the house took on a whole new look with a change of color. 

I do want to qualify that it appears that the project took a long time but this was my decision not the contractor. We have two additional projects that will be completed this year and I will be finished with my long dream list!

So the questions are: Would I hire Baron Construction & Remodeling Co again; would I recommend this company to others; Am I happy with the results? Answer: Absolutely."
2,"I wish I could give only 1 star; the 2nd star is for what they have done right. I read through all the spectacular reviews below so I chose them, but ended up really painful experience which will be unforgettable once in my life time. This is a really long story I have with them. 

Mike appears to be a nice guy and promise whatever you ask; claim they could deliver your dream project. But when coming down to day-to-day project execution, it will be your big nightmare and you are doomed if you go with them.

I just finished a very large addition project with them and the following are the pitfalls:
1) the contract only lists the major items but not down to all the details. In the beginning they alluded that they always write contract this way and not worry about the details; but later on when specific details were requested they argued that those were not included in the contract and would be considered as change order items for extra cost.
2) no interior designer provided: in the contract they promised to offer an interior designer to complete my ideas and discuss all the details to select proper fixtures for my huge addition project. However the first 2 designers quit after first contact; the 3rd one agreed to take this job but couldn't receive my ideas accurately nor complete the design in the booked time frame. I ended up doing the rough design on my own with limited knowledge without any professional assistance. Had to decide and made all the purchases myself. This is in disagreement to the contract.
3) upon signing the contract they claimed they would have 4-6 people on the job site everyday; but that only happened in the first 2 weeks. After 2-3 months they began to not have full crew working full time on your project. On some days even no one showed up due to various excuses. Then the GC began to take vacations or go out of town for personal issues.
4) They claim to progress very fast so they want you to have all the fixtures ready or some jobs would be delayed in order to wait for the parts. So I had to get almost all parts early on in a short time but then realized they'd reach that task much later.
5) Very poor in communication. They send multiple people to interface with you and they are sometime inconsistent within themselves. Not all the parties are on the same page all the time. You need to deal with different people with different personalities and responsibility in one project. And the real working contractors are another different group of people.
6) They'd break the fixtures you buy. The stuff are all stored in the garage before getting used; after long time they may not be able to find specific parts you prepared and claim them missing, or parts may get scratched or broken due to careless handling so you end up buying same items twice.
7) The raining season came before the roof was installed, and they didn't do proper treatment to prevent water damage. Only simple tarp was laid on the frame which collapsed in the evening storm and my existing living room was flooded because the rain leaked through the roof/wall crack they made. When I expressed my concern to them regarding the water-damaged wood frame/wall/floor, they simply shrugged it off saying it'd dry out over time. If they are real professional they should know that the water-damaged wood will be distorted and becomes very hard even after drying out. And the wall will not be evenly flat and becomes wavy in some sections.
8) the floor in the extended living room area is not level with the existing flooring. The flooring was fully renewed in the integrated living room but you can feel the slope in the extended area. When the issue was brought to them Mike first said he'd send some other guy to investigate it; then that guy simply said he couldn't feel the difference and attributed it to the new wood accommodation. 
9) they may do well if your project is quite standardized in that everything just gets replaced without any particular design change. With not too many customization your project would be delayed. In the beginning they claimed to complete my project in 6 months; then it ended up to take 13 months.
10) their secretary's attitude is very poor. When they want to collect payment they want it right away and would harass you in email. But when you request them to fix something they'd have various personal excuses. 

Above are just the major pitfalls what I could remember after 13 months; there are so many miscellaneous minor complains which I cannot list them all. After all, if you choose them, you won't have peace in mind during your project and the journey will be winding, as they are not professional enough to handle projects in modern style."
5,"I worked with Baron Construction & Remodeling Co. on several occasions photographing projects they completed. Each time I was able to witness first-hand uncompromised quality of their work: the beautiful, functional designs, attention to the smallest details, happy home owners. I am confident to recommend their services to even more discerning clients."
5,"I would highly recommend Baron Construction & Remodeling.  We were working with another GC to add a bathroom and new kitchen.  The project was to have been completed in eight months.  Instead it took more than a year and a half and the project was still not completed. My husband and I were very stressed and frustrated as the GC and workers did not show up to work everyday.  
Baron Construction was doing a remodel for three of my neighbors.  They were all very happy with Baron Construction.  We decided to part ways with our GC. Mike decided to help us finish our project so we would pass our final inspection. Needless to say, we were  very happy and relieved to be working with Mike Baron.  He checked the job site often and saw that things ran very smoothly for us.  Everyone from the job crew to the office staff is very professional, friendly, and efficient.  Very happy with the quality of their work. Each project has been completed in a timely manner. We still have little projects that they are helping us correct from the last GC.  I would highly recommend them."
5,"My wife and I wanted our old home to wear a new look. So, we consulted the Mike of Baron Construction- with his crew- to make our dream come true. The task was deftly executed, and each day ends with a general cleaning even till the last day of the work. Our experience with them was quite awesome – every time they resume work, the atmosphere seems like a family reunion, Mike and his crew diffuse warmth and friendliness each day. Now, our home is a place of regular visit for our friends. All thanks to Mike and his crew for their best shot that changed our old house forever into the best we can ever think of."
5,"I can't say enough how helpful Eli Levy and Mike Baron were in our construction project. We started with a master bath and kids bath remodel, but the project soon expanded to the entire upstairs. Eli and crew were easy to work with, extremely detail oriented, and had great suggestions throughout the process. Even as we expanded the scope of our project, Eli kept the project moving and we were quickly finished with an entire floor remodel. We couldn't be more happy with the results and even look forward to our next project."
5,"We really enjoyed our remodeling process with Baron. We interviewed a couple of contractors and are glad that we made the right choice. Eli has been really pleasant to work with from the very beginning through the end. He is responsive, professional and paid attention to details. Luis and Emilio, who worked onsite were fairly hard-working and friendly. Though it took a bit longer and extra rework to install the tiles perfectly, it was an overall smooth and efficient process. We love our freshly updated home when we wake up every morning."
5,"I never thought that remodeling could be as hassle-free as Mike and his team made it to be. Last year, my husband and I had a grand plan to remodel our kitchen. We had been getting into cooking and loved entertaining that we felt it was time to make the plunge! I learned about Baron Construction from a friend who spoke very highly of them. All I can say is that our decision to get our kitchen remodeled and to work with Mike has been ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS for our family ever. The whole process went by smoothly. We set up an estimate and then they promptly started with the work. They made the house very livable and they were there to answer any questions. Now the finished product was wonderful! I don't know how we could have waited this long for the kitchen remodel. We got our dream kitchen and even if our home was built in 1988, it made our house look brand new. The cost was reasonable and very worth it due to high quality. Very satisfied and I cannot wait to get other parts of the home done by Mike and team too."
5,"Of all my years managing my home, i have never encountered a contractor as reliable, creative and efficient as Baron Construction. These folks are the best and i would only trust remodeling my home with them! They worked on my kitchen, guest bedroom and living room and kept the place clean throughout the process. It was very liveable to come home. They respected the place and did a fantastic final job at a great price! I never knew my kitchen could look like one out of the magazines but they gave very useful design advice. I would get them again for all future jobs! Communication was polite and very consistent as well. Six stars!!!"
5,"I am not a fan of remodeling projects. I am always worried that the time and effort is too tedious for our household, given that I work full time and manage a small business. Mike and the team at Baron changed all of this. Remodeling was hassle-free because they kept the entire house clean throughout the process. They listened to us about what design we wanted and delivered on it. Everytime we had a question, the team was always one call away. I never thought our bathroom and masters bedroom can look as beautiful as it is now. Next: my kitchen! I will only trust them. Great value for money. Prices are on point and you can see the high quality."
5,"I used Baron for an extensive kitchen remodeling job, as well as new flooring and ceilings.  The management of the job was excellent, with lots of design advice and guidance, flexibility in accomodating my personal choices, and high level of expertise in all phases and areas of the job, which included complete demolition of the existing kitchen, installing all rough plumbing and electrical, new flooring (tile and wood), new cabinetry, and painting throughout.  Eli, especially, was terrific at managing the whole thing. The crew was always respectful and courteous."
5,"When you work with Mike, Eli, Oded and Cheryl, you get great customer service and amazing work. I've tried other contractors in the past, but the quality of their work is literally the BEST in the market. Highly recommend!"
5,"My bathroom called for a much-needed makeover... I had been thinking about it for years. I heard from a friend that renovating bathroom would increase value of the house, so I said game let's do it. I asked around for the best contractors in the South Bay and instantly got drawn to the team of Mike and Eli of Baron Construction in Saratoga. From my first inquiry, they were patient with taking me through the entire process.  They came promptly for a free estimate. They listened to my design and gave valuable inputs. They were experts in constructing and were very efficient way - being sensitive to my budget and true to my vision. The construction came and went and it was a breeze! I did not stress about anything because they guided me throughout the process - plumbing, design, materials, labor! I couldn't be happier with the end result. My bathroom is exactly how I imagined it and more. I will definitely call them again for my future projects. THEY ARE THE BEST!"
5,"Best re-modelers in the Bay Area! They are extremely trustworthy, no hidden costs and are patient in answering any questions. I showed them a picture of my dream kitchen and everything exceeded my expectations - the finish seems very good, the lighting is perfect and the paint is amazing! They know their design stuff. These guys are the real deal."
5,Baron Construction has made my dream home a reality! I never thought my patio and living room had the potential to be a designer home but they did it. At a very reasonable price too. Very satisfied with the work!!!
5,"Baron woah , just  woahhh ! amazing work done by guyz . love you guyz, i'd prefer to hire you again, one of my favourites in Saratoga , 
me & my wife wants new kitchen,  you guyz did the job very well, great work indeed"

5,"Eli Levy of Baron Construction and his crew, Luis and Fernando, did an outstanding kitchen remodel – on time and within budget! Eli was very patient with our first major renovation and helped us pick out flooring, cabinets and handles, backsplash, countertops, sink, disposal, and lighting. Moreover, he also brought the walls, insulation, electrical, the junction box and smoke/CO detectors up to code in the original time estimated. Luis and Fernando were polite and worked long hours to finish their projects, letting us know when they were starting or finishing for the day. They cleaned up at the end of every day and Eli gave the kitchen a professional cleaning at the end. They even did little extras like putting in a dimmer switch and installing an under-the-counter toaster oven. Our most positive renovation ever and I hardly recommend Eli, Luis, Fernando and Baron Construction.
Mike and Carol C. Menlo Park"
5,"Baron Construction & Remodeling is the BEST contractor that I have EVER worked with. The quality of workmanship is beyond excellent. They were constantly in touch with us making sure we were satisfied with the work in process. If we had a question they would immediately respond. Fantastic Customer Care!! So if you want to have a ""Wow"" experience with a contractor just give them a call."
5,"My husband and I have been wanting to redo our kitchen and we finally had the opportunity to do so earlier this year. Since we have never done any renovation project before, we decided to research online and found a website that allowed us to reach out to several companies. We collected 5 companies, one of which is Baron Construction. They were the first one to contact us via email. We narrowed our choices down to three companies and set up appointments to meet with them. We met Eli and we immediately connected. We had a vision of how we wanted our kitchen to be and this is something ""out of the box"". Eli understood our vision despite it being different from most of his clients' and he assured us every step of the way that he will carry out this vision. This was very important to us. Bottom line is, after 8 weeks of patience, our kitchen turned out to be what we had envisioned it to be. Eli and Baron Construction delivered what they promised to deliver and we are very happy with the result. We have since hosted parties at our home and have received very positive feedback on the kitchen. We will not hesitate to recommend Eli and Baron Construction to my friends and family. Keep up the good work."
5,"As remodeling jobs go, ours was rather small (under $50K) but you would never know that from the attention we received from Mike and Eli at Baron Construction. We had a minor problem with one of their sub-contractors, but it was resolved immediately and the bottom line is that the job was done in a timely manner and we are extremely pleased with the results. Mike's design suggestions were spot-on and without them, the results would not have been as good as they were."
5,"While we did not hire Baron Construction for our current project given a pre-existing relationship with another contractor, we were very impressed by the professionalism and responsiveness of this company. We contacted several firms and Baron stood out. Jesse came to our home for an initial consultation and immediately followed up with another visit to go through the proposal in detail - and we found both the proposed scope and budget to be very fair. We will definitely consider Baron in the future."
5,"My parents shopped around for a while before Baron Co and Remodeling. They made it worth the search. Very respectful of our ideas, and the kitchen was finished with great attention to detail. Would recommend them to anyone. May use them again for a bathroom
In the future."
5,"My partner and I contracted Baron Construction after we bought our home.  I was referred to him by a friend, since she had previously hired him to do a bathroom upgrade. Our wash room and kitchen needed an upgrade for what seemed to be the longest. The previous owners had done little to no work on the house. He did an amazing job. Both, my partner and I were left satisfied from the work done on both rooms. Great attitude, and great service."
5,"Very satisfied with this company and their services. From the first consultation all the way down to the last day of business, there was a sense of urgency and attention to my needs as the customer. My kitchen had lots of work to be done so I was honestly surprised all deadlines were met. All my requests were met, even the paint in the downstairs bathroom came out exactly as I had envisioned. I would recommend this companies services to anyone who wants a Grade A job done to turn their house into a home. :)"
5,"i Shopped around for a couple of companies, asked around to friends and I still was not sure. I was able to read about the company and had heard from a friend who had recently used their services to do the entrance of their home. After the initial contact I knew this was the right choice. The representative sent to my house was on time, friendly and seemed to be interested in the overall look I was going for. Even though I wanted a much more intricate look they were able to bring my idea to a reality and within the budget in a timely matter. And most of all it was done according to HOA regulations. I would seriously like to recommend them to my friends who need any jobs around the house."
5,"highly recommend this company, I am so pleased with the work that Mike has done. My kitchen looks brand new! Was very respectful of my ideas as well. Might have them do some more work for my home in the future."
5,"I could not be more pleased with the professionalism they have shown me. The 2 bathrooms at my house needed some remodeling. The sight of the floor, the sink, and the tub looked so outdated. They did an amazing job in transforming it. I couldn't be more happy to use my bathroom. My son was surprised when he saw his bathroom. They remodeled his tub as well as the flooring. He is excited to finally take a bubble bath in it. Their pricing is very fair, the material they have is excellent, and I loved how they take the time to listen to what you want (especially if you are detail orientated like me). This company has been so helpful that I will definitely refer them to friends and family."
5,The estimate I was given was fair. I received three other estimates and I feel I was given a fair quote for the work I wanted.
5,"I contracted with Baron Construction a about 3 months ago, I wanted to wait on writing review to make sure that the work was completed and in properly working condition. 

From the very first initial call, all the way through the completion of my kitchen and bathroom remodel my experience was amazing! My husband and I had just purchased our first home (which needed major upgrades) and we were a bit scared for lack of better words that someone would see that we are a young couple and would take advantage of us... a friend referred us to Baron Construction and  Mike was great! He sat with us and listened to what we wanted and all of the ideas we had and made those ides come to life. He even added an island! which I though wouldn't be possible.  He worked with us every step of the way.  Our kitchen and bathrooms are beautiful!!! 

We did end up going above our initial budget since his work is a bit pricey, but in the end it was well worth it! it's true what they say... you get what you paid for. And we LOVE the end result. The quality of his work speaks for itself. Our house finally became a home and we couldn't be more pleased. Thanks guys! 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
5,"My home needed a real make over. Specially my patio and fireplace. I'm very picky on who I will have working in my home. We had different vendors come out and give us estimates. Baron Construction and Remodeling CO gave us that feeling that everything was going to be taken care of the way we wanted our home to look like. From providing an estimate, clear explanation on how things were going to be done from beginning to end and last but not least great customer service. We were given the option to choose a date on when was more convenient to us, for them to come work in our home, of course within a range of dates they had available. From the moment they arrived at our home until the moment we came back. Everything was very well organized and on point. Phenomenal structure and workflow. With that being said I couldn't have chosen a better company to come and remodel our home. Extremely satisfied with the remodeling. Phenomenal work Baron Construction and Remodeling Co. Most definitely will recommend and will keep you for future remodeling in our home"
5,"My patio looks amazing! I mean, really! And we wouldn’t have been able to procure the perfect backyard without Baron. They were smart, helpful attentive and totally affordable. As soon as they were done I knew I had to write a review – a really, really good review. 

From start to finish Eli and crew were totally on our side. From planning to production, they considered what we wanted, and figured out a way to incorporate almost every single detail. The finished result looked exactly like the picture I had in my head – my dream backyard was finally a reality. 

I have to mention the price! Most companies I spoke to before hand wanted an arm and leg just to talk, but our guys at Baron quoted us appropriately AND our bill stayed the same from first quote to finished product – I couldn’t believe it! These guys are not only skilled but trustworthy too. 

In the end, we really loved working with them and would recommend to anyone looking for an equally positive experience with their remodel."
5,"Right away, I knew that this review would be a positive one - I have nothing but great things to say about the entire Baron construction crew. From day one, I felt fully informed with what needed to be done to retrofit our roof, and the lead on the project kept us in the loop through every minuscule detail, throughout the entire process. Not only am I completely satisfied with our newly secured roof, I HAVE to say that I felt completely secure having the team in and around my house unsupervised. PLUS they cleaned up after themselves every single day. How many construction companies can you say that about? On top of that, I got a fair price for the work they did, which stayed relatively the same throughout the entire process. No up sells or added costs for work they didn’t explain to me in detail. Overall we are more than happy with our choice – would definitely recommend Baron to anyone with retrofitting needs."
5,"We hired them to make some major repairs to the exterior of an older home we just bought. The repairs were related to dry rot and water damage to eaves and siding identified in the termite report.

They listened to what we wanted done and our priorities. They kept us informed as they progressed through the work and consulted us in a timely manner when needed. They worked consistently but did not rush. We were particularly concerned when we learned parts of our metal roof would have to be removed to do a proper repair. We had no need to be concerned however because they did a great job of replacing all the roofing tiles so you could not even tell they had been removed. We recently purchased this house and it is over 40 years old. We had no idea if they would find other damage when the siding was removed. They didn't and we really appreciated that they did not take advantage of us in that way.

The workers were professional, friendly and very skilled. Everything they did looks great and we were surprised at what a great job they did matching the old paint.  The siding repairs are not obvious and look fine with the rest of the siding that was untouched. They cleaned up thoroughly when they were done too."
5,"After our second child was born, I realized we needed to add another room to our home. The problem was that I wasn’t quite sure how we could do it because our was already cramped with small rooms. After a few recommendations, I called Baron Construction & Remodeling and told them the issue that I was having and they sent over a representative. We went through my home and he quickly noticed that the attic could be turned into another room with a small staircase added. It made perfect sense and the added stairs would not take up much room. 
So, after getting the estimate we set the appointment date and the work started on our new room. From the start I noticed the professionalism and work ethic from Baron Construction & Remodeling who seemed eager to take on the challenge of building our new room in the attic. During that time, they worked with us when we had to be gone so that everything would flow smoothly. To my surprise, the job was completed a bit ahead of time and I was lead through the entire room to make sure it was to my specifications. 
All in all, I was very pleased with Baron Construction & Remodeling as they did a great job of creating a new room out of our unused attic space. Now we have the extra room in our home needed all for a price that fit our budget. I cannot recommend the professionals at Baron Construction & Remodeling enough for their work."
5,"We reached out to several different vendors, but decided to go with Baron even though they weren't the cheapest.  We were naturally skeptical in having a relationship with any contractor, but our conversations with Mike and Eli regarding the finer points of the work estimate and the timeliness schedule of the work gave us the confidence we were looking for, so we pulled the trigger and went with Baron.  We made sure to be as flexible as we could be regarding timing, and I stayed in the house for the duration of the work.
The day before the work started, Eli called me to make sure I knew what to expect, as this was my first remodel of this scope.  Eli came out to the site, and we talked through where the majority of the work was going to take place, and what I could expect during and after the construction on each day.  I work from home, and was able to spend quite a bit of time being annoying and poking around the worksite, asking questions of the various crews that wereperforming work (foundation, framing, plumming, etc).  I'd talk with Eli every couple of days, and they were very flexible with my indecision, and periodic changes.  My wife went back and forth on what she wanted to do about a dozen times, and Eli had the patience of a saint, and made sure we got what we wanted.
Overall, the various crews were neat, punctual, and friendly, and the management was available and attentive, ! I was able to speak to someone when I needed to, and they were understanding in how stressful this process can be for a homeowner.  These guys were great! I highly recommend them!"
5,"My husband and I were referred to Baron by two different sources - the top pick from an online search by Home Advisor, and by my friend's parents. I was able to see my friend's parents recent kitchen remodel that was completed by Baron's project manager, Eli Levy, and his crew from Baron Construction. We own a 68 year old home and planned to remove a load bearing wall which separated our kitchen and living room in order to have an ""open concept"" living space. We also had our one and only main bathroom of the house completely remodeled by Baron as well. 

We met with Eli shortly after we signed all of the paperwork to begin the job in order to select the products that we wanted in our kitchen and bathroom at the warehouse and showroom. Eli's expertise and eye for design really helped in the process of shopping for our dream kitchen. The estimated timeline when we signed on to complete the job from start to finish was about 8 weeks.We worked with Baron and the structural engineer, and they were able to completely hide the massive load-bearing beam into the ceiling so the look of the kitchen and living space is seamless and beautiful. 

Of course, with all construction projects, it is crucial to constantly check on the contractors' work and job progress. My husband and I went to check on the house on a daily basis and always communicated with Eli on any issues that we had. We hired a moving company and completely moved out of our 3-bedroom home so that construction could be completed by Baron. Every room in the house was touched, so it was crucial for us as homeowners with a young infant child to be away from the construction zone.  Eli was always very professional and accommodating to work with, as were all of the contractors that came to complete the job. The contractors from Baron were extremely hard-working and friendly, and everything was communicated in the proper chain of command. 

Overall, the project timeline took about 4 months to complete. I am happy to say that we are now living in a beautiful ""almost brand new"" 68 year old home, and are very pleased with the layout and design of our new kitchen and bathroom. The experience of remodeling a home is definitely stressful and sometimes was not fun, but the end result is night and day! Baron does good quality work, but it is always important to check on the progress of your project as the homeowner and as the customer."
5,"They are very professional & knowledgeable.. Their is some of the best work we have experienced in a long time. Issues are dealt with promptly, and customer satisfaction is clearly a priority. Highly recommended!"
5,"Baron Construction is a excellent company. We would definitely hire them again.
We had learned that there was a serious problem under the house while having electrical work done. The concrete foundations at the bottom of the pier pilings were disintegrating. 
We left voice messages with several different contractors and foundation companies that we researched online, but many did not call back. Even more did not keep appointments.
Eli Levy of Baron Construction was the exception. He made a timely appointment and arrived when scheduled. Although we had been doing research online regarding foundations, this was a fairly grey area to us. When Eli came and looked in detail under the house, he informed us the problem was bigger that we had at first thought. We only had piers on half on the house!
While talking over the work that must be done, and the age and condition of the house, we brought up the condition of the roof. Eli looked at the roof and saw the sagging areas that we pointed out. We talked about El Nino and stared talking about roof repairs. It turned out that the roof was in worse shape that it looked on the surface; in fact there was no plywood base and only 2 layers of failing shingles (one wood, the original ""roof deck"").
We negotiated an excellent price by being flexible with start and finish dates. We even ended up having Eli use one of his (excellent) crews to do major internal painting in the house!
All inspections were passed on the 1st visit with flying colors. If you need work on your house, big or small, new or old, we heartily recommend speaking to Eli Levy before signing contracts with anyone else."
5,"We first find Baron construction and remodeling on Angie's list they have highly recommended reviews. we had Mike come to our house to give us an estimate, after we reviewed 3 others, 20 minutes in to the meeting we knew that Baron Construction is the company to do our project.
Mike gave us amazing ideas as how we can enlarge our kitchen. he is the only contractor that listen to my needs for more storage space, and also the only one that came up with the solution for that at the first meeting. he also able to fit an island they gave me my dream kitchen. there price was higher then the others but its worth it.  when you meet them at the first time you will notice the difference and the professionalism. along the process i met all there crew members and it was amazing to see how they all taking pride of what they do.
The company spirit transfer to every one of the workers. they also helped us to find the wright budget for our project and make sure we are not over spending. there guys always came on time. we will use them in the near future for our bathroom remodeling project, we are recommending them to everyone and to all our friends."
5,"The Baron Construction and Remodeling demoed the entire kitchen, and remodeled all the counters and installed new cabinets. They also installed all the appliances. Ensured that the new kitchen meets all the new building codes. Baron Construction and Remodeling did a very professional job and taking our requests and suggestions into consideration. All the workers are polite and professional. The project leader, Eli Levy is very attentive and visited the job site frequently. The owner, Mike Baron also paid several visits personally. They also built a custom bench for our kitchen nook which turned out very nice.

For the downstairs bathroom, they also demoed the entire bathroom and built the shower from scratch. They did a great job on the tile for the shower. It is the most beautiful shower in the house now. 

I would recommend Baron Construction and Remodeling to my friends and other people."
5,Mike and Eli did an amazing job on our kitchen remodel and bathrooms. Very professional and took care of any issues that came up immediately.  They really support the client. The job was beautiful. No delays except in our part with our gorgeous back splash. I would highly recommend. My friends who have seen the kitchen comment on the fact that it's beautiful and looks like it should be in a designer magazine. You do get what you pay for and I would do it again!!!!
5,"I would highly recommend Baron Construction for your next project, and here's why.  We had a bedroom remodel and Josue and the Baron Construction team were very professional from Day 1.  When they came in to scope out the work, we were provided with an estimate at the same time - with an initial write up of the contract.  We also received documentation on their licenses, bond, and insurance - all on the first meeting.  Baron Construction was able to start our project a few days after we had signed the contract.  

Once the project started, the team was very conscious to cover the floors and other areas to make sure it wouldn't be impacted from the work.  They had estimated 2 weeks to complete the work and came within that timeframe.  Our bedroom remodel included replacement of ceiling (due to leak from bathroom above), check for additional leaks, texturize ceiling and paint, installation of recessed lighting, painting of walls and closet interior, replacement of carpet with new flooring, and new baseboards.

We were impressed with their commitment to the quality of their work and made sure we were happy along the way.  If you have home improvement projects in mind, I would recommend Baron Construction.  I know we'll definitely keep them in mind for our next project."
5,"First they came and give us an estimate that we really liked, we signed the contract to do the kitchen floors.
Before they started  the job I ask them to give me a price for the complete kitchen remodeling.
again we liked the price and we signed the contract (BTW they helped us with financing the job).
during the process we found out the electrical wiring needs to be replaced mike gave us very good price on that so we let them do it.
they also gave us 3D design rendering that was great, we actually could see how the kitchen will look like.. 
Roy Mike and the team where very helpful they answered all of our concerns and even when we change things around they where very understanding and helped us to make our dream come true.
we where very impressed when all city inspection pass at the first time.
we love how our kitchen came out, it looks amazing like it came out of a catalog, its like living in a mention. 
we will use Baron construction again to do our roof in the in the near future.
they did exactly what they promise and above.
we are extremely happy that we choose Baron construction and remodeling  to do our kitchen."
5,My kitchen remodel is so beautiful!  The project manager communicated effectively so were kept informed of timelines and next steps. Our designer listed to what we wanted and helped us create our dream kitchen! All of the contractors were very professional and treated my home respectively.
5,"I had an absolute blast doing my kitchen remodel with Beatris Gross. she was absolutely fantastic. Confident, professional, knowledgeable, and with a real eye for design choices, the kitchen looks even better than I would have hoped. she had a real knack for not only answering all of my questions, but taking what my wife and I wanted to do with our kitchen and making it part of the whole project. Absolutely I will be working with her again for any remodeling projects."
5,"Treeium and specifically Beatris Gross and her entire team are worth every penny. No matter the size of the project you can tell they all care about the details and doing things right the first time. I never had to wonder if this work was up to code. They are experts and artists in what they do and every single crew was respectful, skilled, and honest. We have found our contractor for every other project. We needed someone to guide us through the kitchen renovation process and we found that in Beatris. We love our new kitchen and can’t wait for future work!"
5,"Our home renovation couldn’t have been completed without the great work from Treeium. We added 400+ sq ft to our home, turning it from a 3 bed/2bath to 4 bed/2 bath, large open concept with new kitchen & dining room. Like any home reno, there were some unexpected items, but Sam & the team worked with us to prioritize what we wanted and needed. We love how everything turned out!! I highly recommend this team!"
1,"Treeium recently completed the remodel of a portion of my home and a detached garage to create two apartments (ADUs). Unfortunately, my experience was very negative and fraught with tension, disagreement, and arguments. Most importantly, the project was scheduled to be completed in 3.5 months but took over 7 months to complete, without a reasonable cause for the delay. Additionally, they repeatedly touted their years of experience and expertise, which caused me great concern when I discovered that their contract’s payment schedule forced me to pay large sums of money for work that had not been completed. On a positive note, their sales pitch and marketing are exceptional."
5,"We used Treeium for a complete new kitchen and bathroom. From the  start to the finish, we were guided along each step of the way by Beatris, the wonderful project manager, who worked on it! She was there to assist us with every single decision that we had to make! She gave us details about each product and offered excellent suggestions, and then allowed us to make the final decision. She is very knowledgeable about everything that her job entails and extremely precise with even the small details, thus assuring that the end results will be exceptional!! We loved her for that! Over the duration of the project, she also showed kindness and consideration in that she willingly made adjustments to do things at a later time of the day to suit our schedule,  and even assisted us in getting a driving cart in the stores when necessary, due to health issues! Overall, we think that Beatris went ‘above and beyond’ the requirements of her job, and we are absolutely pleased with the job done! We would definitely recommend Treeium and Beatris to everyone!!! We are so delighted to have a beautiful new kitchen and bathroom!"
5,"Treeium is awesome! Seriously, the most incredible discovery I've made. We had a complex project (2 walls, a bi-fold door, and glass) and Treeium handled it flawlessly. Several other larger companies that I contacted stated that they would be unable to come in for another week, implying that someone would be sleeping in the living room, and that their charges were significantly higher without tax. Treeium was cost effective, well-organized, and extremely efficient. Sebastian phoned back to confirm and even offered to come earlier in the day on Saturday, recognizing that work into the afternoon/evening would cause complications in our building. Sebastian and his team performed miracles in a matter of hours, and the wall beyond our expectations. We were blown away by their professionalism and friendliness, especially on such a frantic move-in day.

After the wall was done, we intended to add plexiglass to the top but were unable to do so due to a lack of materials. Sebastian contacted the next day to set a time for early Monday morning to come finish the repair and allow me to continue working later in the day. He did a wonderful job, and it gives even more privacy while maintaining the room's natural light.

Sebastian and the entire team at Treeium did an excellent job! Thank you guys!"
5,"We've had an amazing experience with Treeium. In and out in a flash with a flawless product. We've utilized them on numerous occasions for large-scale projects and they've always started and finished on schedule. After the workers departed one of the projects, I identified a minor issue that needed to be addressed. I contacted Sebastian and he answered instantly and arrived the next day to resolve the issue without charging me further fees. Impeccable service and overall great quality products."
4,Eran was friendly and professional from the beginning.  I loved the 3D design at the beginning.  It allowed us to be more specific in the material selections.  It was really a great experience working with Eran and Treeium.  And the bathroom looked even more beautiful than we imagined. I highly recommend them both for any future remodels.
5,"Treeium did everything that they promised to do and did it in less time than originally estimated.  Our Project Manager AmirTeymouri was nothing short of amazing.  He stopped by the project every day just to check in and make sure we didn't have any questions.  Not only that but he always answered my calls or texts within a few minutes...even on Saturday or after hours.  

I have heard (and had) horror stories about contractors but not the case with Treeium. I can assure you that Amir will be our only call when we are ready for the next project."
5,"There was a leak from the shower pipes that went unnoticed for months. When discovered, the damage was too extensive so we decided to bite the bullet and remodel. Treeium outperformed my expectations with the bathroom remodeling project. I had the pleasure to work with Beatris Gross, who exemplifies the meaning of customer service and delivers on her commitments. She was attentive to all of my inquiries, responding immediately. I was 400 miles away during the remodel and she kept me apprised at every single step through phone calls, texts and pictures. I appreciated her remodeling expertise and eye for detail. The workers on the remodel are masters of their crafts, not jacks of all trades. This gives me the assurance the work was done correctly. No more leaks! The project was finished within the time frame stated and I am very pleased with the result. I highly recommend Beatris.  And I would definitely work with her again."
5,"they were wonder to work with. I would recommend them without hesitation. They were professional, pleasant, and responsive. ok ok"
5,"Farid and his team from Treeium did an excellent job remodeling our bathroom. The end result was better than we imagined. Farid was responsive, completed the job on time and there weren’t any surprises in cost. We will use Farid Ghaheri and his team when we are ready to remodel our kitchen."
1,"SPENT $$$ - GOT NOWHERE!!!!  I had an awful experience with this company.  They were paid for their professional expertise to assess whether a simple balcony could be built.  Upon their assurance that it could be, I engaged upon the next phase of the project.  After several months and additional payment, they informed me that it could not be done.  Rather than taking responsibility for their error and refunding the second payment, they decided to double down and charge me more!!  UNETHICAL, UNREASONABLE, UNRELIABLE."
5,"We had a storage room off the garage converted to a studio apartment. The project managers Dorel Zander and Lior Lazrovich, their  architect, designers, and work crews were friendly and excellent at what they do.  Even with the issues that the City raised about the property and physical challenges,  they were willing to work with us, within our budget, to get the job completed within the time frame we were working with.  Dorel and Lior stayed in constant contact with us throughout the project, particularly with the stages of the remodel and the city inspections. They were always very responsive to any questions or concerns we had and addressed them fully.   The bathroom and kitchenette look terrific.  Very pleased with the overall experience."
5,The company with Avram and Eran Dukeman were very helpful in guiding us through the entire project remodeling our entire kitchen and 2 bathrooms. They were always clear about choices to be made and when changes were necessary. They also tended to spot problems before we noticed them. Good guidance all through the entire project.
2,"I would steer clear of this company.  They started my kitchen remodel August 3 and it is October 29 and it is not yet complete.  There have been 28 working days that there were no workers at the house.  The foreman never comes around nor does the project manager.    Several times the inspector came to the house and no one from Treeium was there to meet them.  I asked for my concerns to be escalated and was told management were all busy.  The communication from the project manager to the workers is horrible.  The cabinet guys had no idea we were to have toe-kick drawers or certain pull-outs.  I asked one of the workers, who is giving you direction and they indicated the direction was coming from me. I call the phone number and there is an option to select 3 to discuss concerns with a project, but when you select 3 you receive an error message and it disconnects you. The only saving grace is that the kitchen looks really nice and I am pleased with it but the process to get there was horrible!"
5,"Treeium remodeled two of our bathrooms and we couldn't be more pleased with the result. Everything was completed professionally, on time and within our budget. Dorel Zender is excellent as a project manager. He is client focused, very professional and has an excellent demeanor for working with people anxious about having work done on their home. 

We are currently using Treeium to convert a window in one of our bedrooms into a sliding glass door along with adding a deck to allow us better access to our yard. Everything has been going well.

I definitely recommend Treeium and you would be fortunate to have Dorel as your project manager."
5,"Our home was in desperate need of a remodel, it needed everything, new roof, flooring, re wire,  re plumb, four bathrooms, game room and a kitchen. Basically our home was a gut job.  I had been dreaming of a remodel for years. Needless to say we were nervous about hiring a company that could handle such a big project. After talking to numerous contractors I was becoming discouraged, no real quotes and no time lines.  Then I discovered Treeium and knew I had found a company that I could trust with a 1/2 million Dollar renovation.
Shahar Algazy has been nothing short of amazing, treating our home like his own and diligently keeping everything on time and on budget, if not Below.  Everyday since we began Shahar has had a 10 man crew on the job, practically unheard  of with most companies. When it came time to upgrade the electric panel we were faced with the possible need to destroy a large portion of  our yard and cut down a  beautiful and stately tree that is a major feature in our yard. Shahar could have left it at that but he went the extra  mile to find a better solution. Shahar saved us 30K and our beloved ficus tree.
We continue to be impressed with Treeium's customer service and communication. The Treeium portal is very easy to navigate and keeps everything clear and organized. We love the gallery that lets our friends and family keep track of the  progress. Great work Treeium and Shahar Algazy for talking such good care of our home."
5,"My wife and I were looking to completely open up our kitchen and bring into a modern aesthetic. As you can see in the pictures, we had a very cramped galley style kitchen with 80s style red oak and old appliances.  

Our project managers, Lior Lazarovich and Dorel Zander, were very easy to work with and understood what we were looking for and made sure to incorporate our needs throughout the design. They were able to remove two major walls to open up the kitchen, and their designer Natali did an amazing job of reconfiguring the cabinets to give us an ample amount of storage.

Overall, I'd highly recommend working with Treeium, and specifically with Lior and Dorel.  They were very professional, always attentive to our numerous texts and concerns even on the weekends (we were those annoying clients lol). They handled everything with an easy going nature that was straightforward and honest. We look forward to working with them again on any projects we have in the future! Thanks guys"
5,"Having never done such a major project, I was more than a little apprehensive about the timeline, but my project manager Beatris Gross made sure everything kept moving.  It took just one month from start to finish.  Everyone who worked on my kitchen was knowledgeable and professional.  Beatris spent hours helping me choose just the right materials to complete my vision for a new kitchen.  I would definitely recommend this company."
5,"Three months ago we finished our project with Treeium, successfully.
Farid & Gabriel played a fundamental role during the entire process, which included dealing with architects, engineers, city codes and builders. They both were very accommodating, patient and extremely professional.  
Our project was a major home remodel (90%). It took less than five months from the moment the plans were approved to completion.
We hired Treeium to ensure our home was built structurally safe & sound, and that’s what they delivered. Have already recommended them to several people."
5,"We recently remodeled our master bathroom.  We gutted the entire space and put in both a half bath and a full master.  We could not have been more pleased with Treeium, the contractor we worked with on this project.  We recommend them highly, and plan to have them return to do our kitchen!  Contract Treeium for all your remodeling needs.  855.833.8733 and ask for Dorel or Lior."
5,"My wife and I are retired and decided to invest in our home of 35 years in Irvine by upgrading all three bathrooms. We had remodeled them only once before and did not have much money at the time and we were determined to get it right this time.

We decided against hiring an interior designer so we interviewed contractors that were larger firms with good resources like a Project Manager that would come onsite weekly and see the project thru from beginning to end. We knew we would pay a little more for that level of service. We decided on Treeium after meeting a few times with our Project Manager Amir Teymouri.

Amir made us really comfortable with the depth of his remodel knowledge, gave us very credible  design idea’s  and excelled at both his verbal and written communications. That combined with Treeium’s size ($100M in annual sales), discounts with major suppliers of bath fixtures  and tile Were ket you decision along with the excellent ratings on Yelp, Houzz etc. So, we signed a contract for all 3 bathrooms with Amir.

Amir did exactly as he said he would by monitoring his crews work, visiting our home several times a week to check on progress, ask us about how we liked the work and communicating to us clearly as to schedule and what materials or decisions were needed (and when) from us.

Amir has terrific contacts with key suppliers like bathroom fixtures, tile stores, shower enclosures etc…. and those relationships really helped when issues would present themselves. For example, our supplier for the master bath sold us the wrong rough-in valve (which was already installed and tiled over) for the filler tube for our soaker tub. Amir handled all the conversations with the supplier and presented us with 3 different alternative replacements for the tube filler that would fit the already installed rough-in valve.
 Treeium is a very good company but as always its the people that make the difference. In my opinion Amir is a very good Project Manager and has a very good team supporting him. I would highly recommend Treeium and especially Amir Teymouri for your home remodel needs.

Bottom line, could not be happier with the final competition of all 3 bathrooms!  I was so satisfied mid-way with through the project I signed another contract to have Treeium paint the exterior of my house and they did a terrific job on that as well."
5,"Treeium is not necessarily the most cost efficient company I’d you shop around, but you certainly get what you pay for with contractors. As a company, it was very professional, the portal is great, you have licensed contractors that are insured at all times. Our process was timely, transparent and on budget which is all we can ask for. 
My review is actually in support of our project manager/contractor Amir. He went above and beyond for our project before, during and after construction. He was available for questions at all hours, gave honest feedback and worked with us to find great solutions. Our kitchen resurfacing was painless and Amir made sure it was finished to perfection down to the last detail. 

We have recommended Amir (and therefore Treeium) to several colleagues and friends and would certainly recommend him and the Treeium team to anyone looking for painless remodeling."
5,"Lior Lazarovich is an outstanding project manager. He has really looked out for me throughout the re-modal process. His daily communication was indispensable. I looked forward to the texts, they kept me apprised every step of the way. Lior Lazarovich, built trust with his strong communication and  his attention to detail. He made me feel relaxed through the process and I am very happy and excited by the results. My kitchen is everything I could have asked for.

If I ever do another re-modal I would just call Lior."
5,"We recently had a four season sunroom addition built at our house. Our project was managed by Medhi Heshmati and Amir Teymouri, and we couldn't have asked for more professional and communicative project managers. From the start, they were with us, helping us plan out our sunroom to our budget, and explaining all the steps and processes involved. They let us know the approximate timeline for start of construction, and what would be involved, and provided suggestions on best practices that would result in a highest end quality for our budget. The build team was professional and always courteous, and were very receptive and responsive to any questions and issues we had. From start to finish, the project was streamlined, and on target, and we are very satisfied with the end result. I will definitely be calling up Mehdi and Amir for future remodels, and would not hesitate to recommend them to friends and family."
5,"Thanks to Lior Lazarovich, Dorel Zander and the Treeium team for the transformation of my parents home! The timeline and communication throughout the remodel process was great! Especially with my busy schedule. All the work was very efficient and thorough. Very satisfied! Would recommend to anyone looking to remodel."
5,"Last November, I started calling around to get some quotes for remodeling my master bathroom.  I'd set a budget and wanted to plan ahead to keep the project on track.  I'd calculated that the best time for the work to begin would be February/March 2020.   Some of the contractors I called turned me down because the work wouldn't be starting immediately.  But when I called Treeium, the response couldn't have been more different.   

Right from our first meeting, project managers Shahar ""Shawn"" Algazy and Guy Borenstein listened to my wish-list, got a sense of my aesthetic, and started making suggestions to realize my vision.  Their advice about materials and 3D rendering of the design were especially reassuring for someone undertaking a remodel on this scale for the first time.

The whole process has unfolded so smoothly.   I've been kept in the loop every step of the way.   Shahar in particular has stopped by regularly to make sure everything has been going to plan.  The crew has been consistently on time, amazingly friendly and polite and very considerate in cleaning up at the end of each day.    The team effort and spirit at Treeium is truly outstanding -- everyone I've talked with has contributed to realizing this vision.  Shahar and Guy are truly amazing!  I'm extremely grateful and very happy to be part of the Treeium family.   Thoroughly recommended!"
5,"Medhi was great to work with. He answered all my questions and provided a detailed scope of work on the bid. Adjusted it multiple times to meet my needs before even signing a contract. His foreman and crew were efficient and courteous. They completed the job on ahead of schedule and passed all inspections with ease. the remodel of our bathroom was amazing, I would recommend them to anybody."
5,"A few months after our massive job was completed (new electrical, new walls, new floors, new doors, new HVAC, etc) we noticed that a couple of our barn doors were starting to stick a bit. When we reached out to Gina at Treeium, she had a crew out to us the next business day to take care of it, free of charge.

The crew was in and out and took care of the two doors without any fuss. We really appreciated that Treeium came out so quickly (and for free) in order to make sure we were fully satisfied with their work."
5,"Treeium is great to work with. Professional, knowledgeable and an overall great experience. Guy, Shahar, Eli and Maya are my team.  They have earned my trust as we are halfway through my complete remodel and addition.  I can sleep better knowing my home is in their hands."
5,"I worked with Eli at Treeium over 3 1/2 months - remodeling two bathrooms. From our first conversation to the last, Eli was a pleasure to work with and Treeium did not disappoint! Our remodeling was (IMHO) pretty extensive -- new sinks, new vanities, new toilets, new lighting, new stall shower, new floors, new tile, and so on. The only thing we didn't replace was the bathtub - because Eli recognized that it could be refinished and look like new (which it did!!). We also did some structural work (reconfiguring a closet and also changing a doorway). I had a million decisions to make in the process of selecting materials, tile, flooring, countertops, etc. -- and so I was in steady contact with Eli to make sure what I was picking out would meet code requirements and would work within the constraints of our bathrooms (e.g., making sure the stall shower wasn't too large for the space). He was always fast in responding, patient in answering my questions, and helpful in providing the necessary information. Treeium's team was also great -- from the folks who handled the loan, to the foreman of the job, to the workers who did the actual work. Everyone was friendly, competent, FAST, and professional. On many days, I was out of town and I had no hesitation leaving them a key in a lock box and letting them work without my actually being there. If they ran into a problem or a question, they contact me -- so I never had to worry that they would make a decision in my absence that I wouldn't agree with. Eli said the first bathroom would take 3 weeks and the second (master) bathroom would take 4 weeks. And he was true to his word! Even allowing for ""wasted"" days due to holidays or waiting for city inspections, the projects were complete in 7 weeks. I would definitely work with Treeium again and with Eli, in particular!"
5,"We just had two bathrooms remodeled by Treeium.  Lior, the project manager, made sure that all was on schedule -- the crews, the suppliers and us.  We are very happy with the new bathrooms in our home.

 

The contract said the job would be done in 7-8 weeks; it was done in 5 weeks.  Lior is a “taskmaster” in the best sense of the word.  He is also a cheerleader.  He kept us all “in line” by reminding us of our responsibilities. He was at the site every day.  His crew was friendly, conscientious, and efficient.

 

We live approximately seven hours drive from the construction site and had several trips planned during the reconstruction.  Prior to starting the project, we were supplied detailed schematics as well as a designer’s full color rendering of what the bathrooms would look like on completion.  As a result, we were able to follow the work via skype or photos which Lior supplied daily.  We made minor changes along the way.  Lior was always positive and gave great advice in relation to costs etc..  We were told exactly how much the project (or changes we made) would cost there were no surprises when the work was completed.   

 

We are more than happy with the work done by Treeium.  We plan to keep on using Treeium for the rest of our renovations because of the fine work done by the crews and the direction of Lior, the project manager."
5,"This was my first remodel.  I was very fortunate to find Amir of Treeium to do my master bathroom renovation.

From the very first meeting with Amir I knew this was the right fit.  He was told me about the company, showed me various jobs he was in charge of as the project manager.  He walked me through the process and made me feel confident that Treeium and Amir were right for the job.

The remodel went like clockwork and was completed ON TIME!! Amir was at the job site almost daily and was always available by text or phone, including weekends and holidays! When in doubt I relied upon his expertise and he never steered my wrong. Amir kept me informed throughout the process. He always told me at the close of work what the next day would be. I appreciated his attention to detail and his honesty.  I always felt I was in good hands.

Not only is Amir wonderful but so are his team.  They were very polite, cordial and without too much interference with my day.  They cleaned up daily and the dust was minimal due to the plastic tarp taped to adjoining rooms. I have a small dog and they were always careful to keep the front door closed so she would not escape.  

After hearing all the horror stories from others about a remodel I feel very lucky to have found Amir. He made the remodel flow easily and flawlessly. If I need any renovations in the future I will call Amir."
5,We hired Treeium to do our second story bedroom and bathroom addition. It was a big job for us and took almost 6 months. Beatris Gross was our project manager and we were so grateful for her! She ensured the work be done right and to our liking on everything. She always responded to our phone calls and texts immediately. We have small children and she was very careful to ensure the home was safe the whole time. Beatris has great taste and helped us pick beautiful finishes for our room. I highly recommend asking for her when you do your job. She was a joy to work with!
5,"Guy has been very good, very thrall with great project management and communication. He is always checking on the project and the progress, my wife Merrillyn and I have been very pleased with Guy Breuer. He is an excellent project manager. Thank you for the great experience."
5,"The company was very professional
And I trusted them above the other five that came out to give me an estimate and they were competitive"
5,"We are just finishing up a bathroom remodel with Treeium.  Etel Littman was our project manager and from the very first meeting Etel was just fantastic.  She listened to our fuzzy ideas and asked great clarifying questions to focus on what we really wanted.  This is our first remodel experience and she made it wonderful and easy.  She really walked us through the process the whole way and helped us protect ourselves from less honest contractors.  Our final inspection is tomorrow and the bathroom is just perfect.  The work quality was fabulous and the team of workers were always polite, conscientious, and hard working.  It was such a great process that I recommended Etel and Treeium to my mother who also wants to remodel her bathroom. I trust Etel to do a great job and to live up to my mother’s demands.  If you are looking to remodel your home, Treeium is just a great company."
5,"Guy Breuer is an awesome project manager for Treeium!  He is very knowledgeable, friendly, and attends to my questions in a timely manner.  He checks in frequently with me, both by phone and email, to keep me apprised of my bathroom remodel's progress.  Treeium has been a great choice for me and I highly recommend Treeium to anyone needing remodeling done!"
5,"The whole Treeium team was terrific.  Guy Breuer was the project manager.  Big kudos....on time, within scope and on budget.  Can't ask for more, except for the finished product which has had nothing but rave reviews from everyone who's seen the kitchen."
5,"Forbes magazine was right, that is all I got to say ! If you are looking to make your home more efficient , to lower your costs overall from your home, this is where you will make the final decision. Treeium was referred to me by neighbor, in Sherman Oaks, we really help each other out, to make sure our community and our homes look and live on it's best. My home was over 70 Years old, and only thing I did was change attic insulation once, no difference, Treeium came , showed me suggestions, and I ended up going with an self efficient smart home,  my living Costs from my home have dropped a drastic 35 percent in costs, I didnt think this was possible, but they made it possible, on top of that,  they went ahead and planted a tree for remodeling my home to an efficient environment friendly home,they really do care about the environment just like it mentioned in the article, I must say they deserve 10 stars not 5, thank you once again for educating me and helping my family live a better and more earth friendly life."
5,"We worked with Shahar Algazy and Maya Orlova on our kitchen, bath and wet bar remodel.  Treeium is proactive, on time, within budget and provides high quality work. Having a large team and industry network enabled them to keep the project moving forward."
5,"Treeium is an excellent company that I have been working with, but the individual that should be recognized by everyone is Etel Littman because of her fantastic customer service that continues to drive Treeium to success. I am thankful for Etel’s high quality customer service she never lets me down or anyone that I know. An example of her excellent service was her knowledge in design and ability to work efficiently with me in providing best pricing and quality material to all customers on time."
5,"We are working with Etel from Treeium. She has been a great project manager for us thus far. She has been very approachable, available, and has helped guide us in our ongoing kitchen remodel."
5,"My husband and I got bids from 7 contractors and decided to move forward with our kitchen remodel with Treeium. A few of the quotes came in at similar prices so what won us over was our project manager, Etel Littman. From the first meeting until now, communication has been clear and straightforward. She was one of the only people to educate us on how to do our homework on a contractor - together we went onto the CSLB website to compare all the companies and overall we liked what Treeium has to offer. Through the process of picking our materials, Etel has also been very flexible and accommodating, meeting us at tile stores, trying to find us the best pricing, and even dropping off samples to our home on a Sunday. Demo starts soon and I'm looking forward to the kitchen of our dreams! I feel our kitchen will be in good hands with this company and project manager."
5,"I used Guy Borenstein from Treeium for a huge project last year, I had my entire kitchen and living room remodeled and upgraded. I was extremely happy with the quality of their work and the caliber of all the workmen that Guy Borenstein has on his team.  Their work exceeded all my expectations! 
I am in the process of remodeling my back yard and bbq area and Guy Borenstein is back to the drawing board!  There is no other contractor I will work with.
Can't wait to see the end result!"
5,"The 60-year old sink in our rental property required serious work. Because they seemed to be the most sincere about fixing our problem, we hired Treeium, Inc. in Valley Village to do the work. Guy Borenstein was the Project Manager and Elizabeth Camarena was the site supervisor. Like most projects, we anticipated a certain level of anxiety until the job was complete but Guy and Elizabeth made this project virtually stress-free for us. The finished work is beautiful and, when we do further upgrades, we will consider Treeium as our first choice."
5,Treeium is an excellent company and Guy Borenstein is an amazing contractor. The company truly cares about their clients and tries their best to be respectful and accommodating during what can be a very difficult time. I have done many projects with Treeium and Guy Borenstein and I look forward to building the ADU that is our next project. I know it will be done with excellent quality given the multiple projects I have already done with Guy and Treeium!
5,"Being our first remodel, my husband and I were a bit anxious about the whole process. From the beginning, the project manager with Treeium, Etel Littman, was great! She was very informative and thoroughly explained what to expect.  Also, she provided great ideas, from the materials, colors and design. Etel was super attentive to details and she has been a pleasure to work with. We look forward to our new home!"
5,"I’ve worked with Treeium on three different projects including two bath remodels and the best thing about them is their desire to accommodate the needs and requests of the customer. They also have great post project support.  In the last project, the project managers Farid Ghaheri and Amir Teimouri were accommodating, flexible and patient. In addition, Jose Castillo who did all the work was very patient and professional. Jose does high quality work and has great attention to detail.  Treeium is a good choice because of their customer service and post project support."
5,Treeium was professional and really cared about our satisfaction through the entire process. From my initial contact they were very responsive. I started contacting different places to learn about bathroom and kitchen remodeling and decided to give Treeium a call. I was super pleased with my initial phone consultation and decided to schedule to have a field estimator out to see the projects and provide a bid. The estimator was very friendly and had a ton of knowledge in the processes and different bathroom and kitchen upgrades available. After meeting with a couple of establishments it was clear to us that Treeium was the company for our projects. The crew and project manager were absolute professionals. We are 100% satisfied and recommend Treeium to our family and friends. Thank you!
5,"I have a small project with Treeium. My project manager is Shahar Algazy. They really give me a good help to finish my project. I owned an apartment since August 2018. I hired a contractor right after I own the place, but they took my deposit and did not do anything for 6 months, which made me into a really bad situation. Then I found Treeium on Yelp. Lucky, they went in the next day after I contact them and give me a big help. My HOA is so hard to communicate. It took us a month to start the project. Shahar even went to my HOA meeting to explain how our project going to do (I have never heard that any contractor will come to the meet, especially for a small project.) Finally, we got the approval letter and start the project. Since then everything goes very smooth. Shahar come almost everyday to see how the work is going. I must mention Roy and his buddy. They do everything perfectly, even surprise the inspector. They use all good and expensive things to make sure everything they did is in a perfect shape. Then the patching guys and painting guys came in after. To be honors the patching guys and painting guys are just alright (nothing bad, I think I just spoiled). However, they still help me a lot on those small projects which belong to myself and not on the contract for free. After a month working. My apartment finally turns into what I was looking for. Shahar is a nice project manager. As a contractor he gave me a lot of suggestions from the customer side, which I believe he can make bigger money without those suggestion. To be the truth, Shahar becomes my friend instead of just a project manager. If you are looking for a contractor. Talk to Treeium and ask Shahar as your project manager. You won’t find any project manager who will pick up your phone almost 24/7 and tell you what the best option is and what the cheapest option is to achieve your goal. Also, if possible, ask Shahar to bring Roy and his buddy in, which will make sure your electric has no problem and shock the inspector because of the nice job. 
As a review, I should let them know that their painters need to improve they job. Nice people as well but can be better. Especially after I have Shahar and Roy, I feel they should be better to be called Treeium.
Thank you Treeium to help me finish my project and give me a lot of help on the small things that I planned to do myself in order to save money."
5,"Treeium is an outstanding company and I loved working with my project manager, Guy.  I live in NY and was doing a bathroom remodel in my San Diego condo long distance.  Guy's communication was excellent and he handled everything for me.  The workmanship was terrific - the bathroom is stunning.  And my sister who lives there said his crew was very polite, very neat, and very punctual.   I highly recommend Treeium, and would use them again in a heartbeat!"
5,"Treeium is an excellent, extremely professional company. They worked fast and efficiently, and created a beautiful new bathroom for us. The quality of the work is outstanding and the entire team of specialists  work together to do an outstanding job. We have now hired them to remodel our kitchen, a second bathroom, as well as other rooms in our home. We would like to thank our contractor Lior Lazarovich and his entire team for a job super well done! Thank you!"
5,"Awesome guy  and  Professional Individual. 
I wasn't aware about Knowledge and skills. Very confident in many areas and topics.  Easy and direct conversation within professional manner."
5,"Treeium has just completed our down-to-the-studs remodel of a 1977 guest bathroom.  Our initial contact was with Tomer Turjeman.  He was pleasant and informative on the telephone, arrived promptly and answered all our questions.  We then left town for two months.  When we recontacted Tomer, he arrived a couple days later and spent several hours helping us clarify how we wanted the remodeled bathroom to look.  He offered suggestions, gently guided us away from a few bad decisions, and offered resources.

Work began within the week.  We opted to select materials ourselves and were very pleased with the suppliers Tomer recommended.  He told us that if we had the materials on hand as needed (we managed to do so), it would take no more than 6 weeks, and that he would try for 4 weeks.  It actually took 18 days from start to finish. 

Each evening, Tomer texted us the plan for the next day.  Three Treeium crews did the work.  All of them arrived when stated, were careful of our possessions, were tidy as the day progressed, and cleaned up at the end of each day, which was generally mid-afternoon.  All 8 guys were pleasant, skillful, and efficient.

This was a relatively small project, but Tomer made us feel that we were his best & most important customer.  We are very pleased with the quality of the work and with our relationship with Tomer.

We found this a very positive experience and have couple more projects in mind with them."
5,"I recently had some major work done with Treeium and it came out great. We had very expensive sliding doors added to the back of our house after another contractor did a poor job. Then the recent rains caused some balcony damage. Gina and Greg were on the case a had a team resolve the problem for us. My home is in excess of $5,000,000 and I felt comfortable using Treeium."
5,"I'd like to thank the good people at Treeium, especially Gina and Greg and all the people at the Quality Assistance Department that help me out with my leaky roof. I had treeium come out two years ago to replace my whole roof, 2 years later we had a leak, even though we're out of warranty for the labor they came out and patch the roof for no charge. Gina was kind and courteous to help me with my problem, and stayed in contact with me till the issue was resolved. And Greg did everything he could to make things right. And stayed on top of things till the leak was fixed. I would recommend Treeium to anyone who needs any general construction done."
5,Amir Teymouri of Treeium is very professional and hard working.  He is doing a great job.  The work looks great.  Very efficient.
5,"I have had experience with one other ""5"" star company and all I can say is not all 5 star companies are the same on Home Advisor. Treeium is a true 5 star company-a class act, a family-like company. First it started with Liran who wrote in detail exactly what we would expect in remodeling our 1970's kitchen. As with some companies, we were not pressured. Next came Natalie, a first class interior designer who did a computer model of our new kitchen in detail. She brought samples of cabinet finishes, back splashes and paint to go with the countertops we had discussed with Liran. During demolition the crew discovered the outside kitchen wall was soaking wet. The wall board and insulation was removed and Liran was called. When our new shower was turned on, the water was running down the wall from a broken drain pipe that had been caused by another ""5"" star company when they replaced the upstairs shower and plumbing a few weeks before. I can't imagine what the damage would have been if we had waited the 3 years to remodel the kitchen as originally planned. Liran came right over to assess the situation and got the repairs done ASAP. The rest of the remodeling came together with no problems and the end result was exactly what we wanted. Unlike the other company who left as soon as the inspector signed the report, Treeium paid attention to the finishing details. All I had to do was text Liran with what I wanted done and it was taken care of; to fixing spots on the ceiling to moving a drawer in one of the cabinets, even the tiniest finishing details were taken care of. I would not hesitate to recommend Treeium and make our kitchen available for viewing by potential customers."
5,"I would like to express our gratitude of selecting Treeium as our contractor for our major remodel to our home in Laguna Beach, Ca.But, more than this, we were fortunate to have Farid Ghaheri as our general contractor. Farid's professionism, attention to details, knowledge of construction/local laws/vendors, communicating and just plain getting the job done, was superb.  Amir was excellent as well. Always available to us. 
Our Remodel was done in 3 months ! Right on Time.
We have recommend Treeium and Farid to any of the other villa owners who are planning on doing any type of remodel. And have communicated to our General Manager, to add Treeium to our community preferred contractor list. Thank You again
Steve & Diane"
5,"We've been working with Ilya Nodel and he is a gem!  We are doing an addition to our home and he is professional and friendly.  He has been patient and also reassuring during the planning stages.  He is always available to answer any questions we might have.  Everything he has told us has been accurate, we couldn't ask for better communication."
5,I hired Treeium to come out and do a bath remodel.  I ended up having them do all the flooring as well.  Guy Breuer was the Project Manager.  I liked that he always responded to my texts and questions promptly.  He met with my schedule.  Was friendly and cooperative with my needs.
5,"We are so pleased with our addition progress of a first floor master. Treeium and Guy have be outstanding. Guy has been an amazing communicator, patient, knowledgeable and caters to our needs. He has been there from the planning, to blueprints, to permits and now almost done with the build."
5,"We could not be happier with our bathroom remodel. Working with Maor (Mike) Tal, the Project Manager, was great. He was always responsive and answered every question we had. The Treeium construction crew was professional, considerate of our time and my family, and did high quality work. We have already talked to Mike about future projects and highly recommend him and his crew."
5,"I started out just getting quotes for refinishing kitchen cabinets, then it became a complete kitchen remodel . After interviewing 3 other companies I went with Treeium.  I connected with project managers Mike Tal, right from the start.  When you have strangers coming in and out of your home for 6 weeks you better like them and I did.  Every worker who came in was great.

  Thank you Mike :)"
4,"“Treeium” a good company

We recently had a bathroom remodel done in our 100 year home in Pasadena.  We went through a selection process of four potential contractors and although Treeium was not the lowest price, we liked their presentation best. We were very pleased with our decision.  Erez, the project manager, was excellent: responsive, easy to work with, and he listened to what we wanted. Treeium’s work teams, tiling (Juan) and plumbing (Marcello) in particular,  were exceptional. Also, all the work crews were very neat and cleaned the area throughly each day. The end result was a bathroom remodel better than we had hoped for and at the price we agreed to."
5,"Wow!!!!

If I am only allowed one word to describe our remodeling experience with Treeium, it would be “Wow”!! 

Disclaimer:  We are not the easiest clients to please; and we do our due diligence extensively.  My wife had prepared a page or 2 full of questions and interviewed 5-6 highly ranked/highly recommended contractors; and ranked them based on points on a spreadsheet.  Objectively, at the end of this process, Treeium came out on top.  Subjectively, we also chose Treeium, as two of the people we know had remodeled recently with Treeium and both recommended this firm.

Our project would be a pretty big project:  We want to update our kitchen and remove two load bearing walls to make our living room/dining room/kitchen into one big open space.  This meant opening   up the roof and put in two supporting beams.  Build an island in the kitchen area.  Switch the stove from one side of the kitchen to the other. Get new appliances and cabinets.  Seal off one of two fireplaces.  Build tiled deco wall where the chimney were.  Completely re-do a downstairs bathroom that has been very dilapidated.  Change a study room into a bedroom.  Wall off part of the family and make it into a storage room.   Move the entry door a few feet away to create a bigger laundry room.  Change an existing storage room into a study room.  Change the flooring on our master bedroom from carpet to tile.  Change the hard wood floor to tile for nearly the entire house.  Re pipe the old galvanized pipes to copper for water.  Re pipe the old gas pipes.  Termite treating the house.  Painting the exterior of the house and most of the interior.  Termite tenting of the whole house.  Building new wrought iron side gates and fences.  In short, 95% of our house is being remodeled.  

That being said, my review will rate Treeium based on Timing (delay), Cost, Quality, and Customer Service.

Timing:
Right from the get go, the project manager, Lior, came to our house and listened to what we wanted to do.  He suggested that we meet with his designer to go over what we want; and the designer came out with a design that really did accentuated everything we had wanted.  The permitting process followed the architectural and engineering studies, and everything went through without a hitch.  Within a few weeks after signing the contract, we were ready for the demolition process.  

At the beginning of this process, I had asked our project manager just how long this project would take.  He told me that this project should be done in 2 months.  I did not believe him when I first heard it; because I know delays are usually to be expected in any remodeling project.  Our previous remodeling done 10 years earlier with much smaller scope was completed in 4 months.  So I was skeptical when I heard that this would be done in 2 months.  The project ended up taking 2.5 months.  The extra 2 weeks were actually not Treeium’s fault; instead it was due the conditions of the house once they opened the walls, and some of the upgrades we wanted after the project had started.  So, I was quite amazed when the project ended up pretty much completed on time.  

So, wow!!

Cost:
Treeium is not the low cost leader out of the many contractors we had interviewed.  Treeium is not the most expensive either.  Its quote falls on par with most of the quotes within a few percentage points.  At the end, we did not pick Treeium because of its price quote; but purely based on how well it scored on our own ratings mentioned above, and how highly recommended they were by their former clients.

Quality of the workmanship:
Wow!!  I don’t exactly know much about construction, so obviously I can’t tell whether whatever Treeium did behind the walls (plumbing, wiring, framing) were great in quality.  I can, however, tell that the finished product, with the entertainment cabinets, the kitchen cabinets, the island, the flooring, painting, and many more, are very much high quality, with definite attention to details. The hardwares used are also top notch.  

In my previous remodeling projects, we had custom ordered cabinets from Home Depot.  These cabinets from Treeium are exponentially better, with soft closing on all of the doors.   

The scope had included installation of recessed ceiling lights for several areas.  Treeium did above and beyond that, and replaced some of my older recessed lights to LED recessed lights.  

In previous projects, the contractors were capable in doing exactly what they needed to do.  Treeium not only did what was in the scope; on many occasions, Treeium went above and beyond what were in the scope.  And, again, everything Treeium did was done well.

Customer Service:

So far, as you may tell, I am truly impressed with Treeium.  But, what really earned my “wow” review, is Treeium’s approach to customer service.  Right after the contracts are signed, Lior, the project manager starts to provide almost daily updates of where Treeium is in the process and what we need to do to get prepared (such as packing and moving out).  Once the project got started with the demolition, the project manager would keep us apprised of everything that’s going on in the house that day, and provide us with a “progress report” and what to expect next.  So, we were kept in the loop every step of the way.  

In addition, obviously with a project this size, some hiccups are to be expected, such as damages caused by the demolition/remodeling.  Those are unavoidable.  Another reason Treeium and Lior earned the “wow” from me is how quickly they respond to our concerns and how well they addressed those concerns.  At the end of the project, we had prepared a punch list of all the items that needed to be fixed due to damages from this remodeling.  Within a matter of days, they were able to fix everything on the punch list, often times to better conditions than they were before this remodeling project.  No delays, no excuses, just get them done.

Wow!!

We have moved back home for 5 days now; and every moment I am here, I look around and remember the way it was before this project, I can’t help but be amazed how quickly this whole project come together; and how satisfied I am with the final result.  

So, wow!!!  Kudos to Treeium and Kudos to Lior, our project manager; and thank you for a surprisingly pleasant experience."
5,"I had been wanting to fix my wooden floor which had been rotting away for the last 7 years due to moisture.  So I was googling home improvement companies, and had 2 companies to come n look at the rotting floor to see what they would say, how they would go about figuring out the cause of the moisture, etc. None of the sales people impressed me enough so I didn't bother to get an estimate for cost. Instead I googled for more companies n saw Treeium. Their website n reviews sounded good enough so I had Treeium send me a salesman. It turned out they actually dispatch project managers with experience: Amir and Farid.
They explained to me a thorough work process/procedure they would implement if I were to hire them  which seemed reasonable n professional. Also, it sounded very convenient for me because they had all different kinds of workers/professionals who could diagnose n fix my floor. 
A long story short, I ended up hiring them n had them not only fix my floors but some electrical lines that had been giving us headaches as well. It took over 3 weeks yet I'm glad I had Amir n Farid take care of my house project. They were prompt n quick to understand the work situation n most of all, they knew how to be sensitive to even the smallest concerns I had. No other companies I had worked with previously on other projects was able to meet such standard. (I'm not an easy person to work with/for) 
Also, I really appreciated how they came to inspect the work morning n evening daily. And I was actually impressed that they brought a portable toilet stand for the workers to use. 
Overall, I am fully satisfied with Treeium n the 2 project managers: Amir and Farid. I highly recommend this company."
5,Treeium did top quality work on our master bathroom remodel.  Even the smallest detail that we weren't satisfied with got resolved.  Amir and Farid listened to what we had in mind and offered design suggestions/options that made our bathroom turn out beautiful.  Tile shower and floor turned out great.  We love the new vanity they suggested.  A very high quality job.
5,Jesse Marquez was very helpful in my initial phone call for estimate appt. he seemed very knowledgeable kind and eager to help.
5,"Took longer than expected (4 months), partly due to several inspections that changed the rules several times. In the end Erez, our Project Manager, completed the job as promised. Thank you Treeium."
5,"Our experience with Avi Shushan has been excellent, He kept us informed in every step of the process,
Avi is very responsive and knowledgeable 
He is the most extreme personable and he made us feel very easy with everything.
We will defiantly recommend him to everyone we know."
5,"There are no words to describe the devotion and attention that we have received from Farid Ghaheri, the project manager, and his crew in the remodeling of our house.  Farid is always available and unceasingly polite, attentive and willing to offer suggestions (that are always well thought out).  His crew does superior work and we especially appreciated the work of Robert, one of the foremen, and Carlos, one of the workers.  The work was done promptly and on budget.  There were no surprises and everything was up front.  If you need any work done, hire this company and ask for Farid !"
5,"Farid Ghaheri is our project manager and I couldn't be more satisfied. He is a no pressure very easy personality. He and his crew are very respectful of my home, my dog and my family. They are there when he says they will be and finish projects on time!!! He is patient with me when I make changes. He is totaly unflappable. I have been very happy with the workmanship of the individual componants that make up my new master bath."
5,"I've hired Treeium in the past and this is my 2nd 5-star review for them, I granted the 5 stars chiefly because of our Project Manager Avihen Levanon who efficiently coordinated the difficult task of a complete remodel of my 120-year-old kitchen. The entire kitchen except for the framework was demolished from the ceiling to the floor, including an outside structure attached to the house which had covered up 2 of the original kitchen windows. The kitchen required a lot of electrical upgrading and I appreciate that Treeium adheres to the strict building codes and my kitchen is in full compliance with the city I live in. Another plus for Treeium are the different choices and fine quality of the cabinets, countertops, and flooring I was given to choose from. My kitchen was built to my wishes, I love it and what a delight having the windows restored. Also, it was completed in the time frame stated."
5,"Update - We could not be happier with our new kitchen and the experience working with Treeium.  Everyone at Treeium was extremely professional every step of the way.  Those working on site and those in the office.  Great craftsmanship, excellent communication, punctuality, attention to detail & commitment to our satisfaction.  (We were picky and asked them to tend to small details we felt weren't exactly right and they came right away and said they were committed to making us happy.)  We have worked with other companies during remodels and the experience has NOT always been positive like this.  We highly recommend!  Thank you, Treeium!


We are in the middle of a kitchen & bathroom remodel with Treeium right now and so far we couldn’t be happier.  

Our Project Manager, Guy Borenstein, made us feel like we are all part of the same passionate team on this remodel from the time we first met up until now.  GHe is responsive, makes himself available when we have questions or concerns.  He’s been willing to take the time to walk us through all the steps of our project, (even if he’s already explained it previously) and he checks in to make sure we’re happy each step of the way.  

The first plans we had for our kitchen turned out to be out of our budget, not just with Treeium but with every company we got a bid from.  Guy was able to work with us to suggest ways to cut down the budget and we arrived at a new plan that we are still extremely happy with and with a price we can afford.  

We were told by friends, family, and even by Guy that going into a remodel can feel like your entire home has been turned into a dirty construction site, but we have been very surprised and impressed to find that Treeium is very clean and professional throughout the entire process so far.  They have used floor protection and sectioned off areas of our home from floor to ceiling while they are working, which has kept nearly all of the dust out of the other rooms, then what has surprised us the most, is that when they leave in the afternoon, they remove all plastic and floor protection so we feel completely at home (and clean) until the next morning when they lay down all the floor protection, and section off areas with plastic again - We feel it really shows that they’re going the extra mile so we don’t feel like we’re living in a construction zone.  

All the actual work completed so far has been extremely high quality, on time, and on budget. Everyone working in our home are polite and professional.  Everyone has been willing to explain to us exactly what they are doing, why, how long it will take, etc.  

When the crew demo’d our old kitchen we found some issues in the walls that needed addressing.  (not treeium’s fault).  Treeium was able to rework the schedule to accommodate the new steps required to address those issues.  

So far we’ve only had a single pice of wood that was cracked in the process of the remodel.  They immediately offered to replace it.  


So far 5 star rating for sure!"
1,"This remodel was the WORST experience ever.  We have a very large bathroom and we were quoted $50K and told that it would take 8 weeks but it took over 8 mths.  At the beginning of this project we felt so much pressure to buy a long list of things they needed so that the project wasn’t delayed.  How were we suppose to do that when all we had was a layout and no measurements? Some of the delay with this project was due to the city inspector but ultimately their contractors were fixing errors or redoing things that weren’t done right.  The first thing we were told is that a portion of a load bearing wall would need to be moved.  They sent me the change order and said that it would cost $7,000.  The first thing I asked is what is the $7,000 for?  I was told not to worry that I’d receive a detailed receipt.  What they sent me was vague and didn’t detail anything.  I never should’ve signed that change order without the detailed breakdown in my hands first.  So they used Simpson Strong-Tie hardware which is great but we told them that my husband and I work for Simpson and that we could provide the hardware that was needed.  They claim they were never told this.  I complained and was told that Treeium didn’t buy any product from Simpson.  This might be true if they already had the parts they needed but that doesn’t mean that those costs didn’t trickle down to us.  Another thing that was added to the change order was replacement of the subfloor in the shower.  We had already done the demo for the shower and it was clear when they saw the project that the subfloor would need to be replaced so to add this to the change order is ridiculous.  They replaced clear block tile with a window in the shower but the window was too big thus half of it was in the shower and half out.  They replaced the window but unfortunately the finish didn’t match the other large window that they installed over the tub so they had to replace it yet again.  We noticed the supply line for the toilet was about 10” away from the toilet so it was an eye sore.  I asked them about it and they said, “That is what the inspector advised us to do and we can’t change it.”   I called the inspector the next day and he said, “I don’t have a change order but I have no problem if you want it moved.”   One concern before even starting the project was whether the exterior stucco/paint would match where they put in the windows.  They told us that they paint the whole wall so there’s no worry about a paint match.  Well because that wasn’t written in the contract they claim that they never told us that.  The tub grout started to fail within the first week and we ended up with 6 extra boxes of floor tile.  They did credit our bill for the extra floor tile.  When I tried to use the tub the first time there was a problem with the water pressure.  They ultimately fixed that but when I tried to use the shower the first time there was no cold water so it was scalding hot.  Apparently there was a part in the valve that was broken or that they broke.  A replacement part was bought and they still couldn’t get it to work.  The 2nd Project Mgr (I was told the first one no longer worked there) called me and told me it wasn’t working and asked if he could go buy another shower valve similar to the one we bought.  I said, “That is fine but we won’t accept a cheap replacement”.  He assured me it would be good quality.  I got home to find that they had to remove two of the tiles from the shower (which I knew nothing about) but the part they bought was a cheap $100 replacement and what we bought was almost $300 so we were not happy.  They installed the plumbing for the vanity before the vanity even arrived which meant that the installation was difficult.  According to the contractors doing the work they told us, “You guys bought the wrong size vanity”.”  No one ever told us what size vanity to buy.  The problem was that they put the plumbing in before they even knew what we purchased.  They cut sloppy holes in the shelves of the vanity to accommodate the plumbing and have since fixed this by making new shelves but I’ve lost most of my space on the bottom shelf.  The silicone they put around the toilet came off after about 7-10 days and they grouted around the tub when that should’ve really been silicone.  They ultimately did install silicone around the tub but they also put it in the shower.  We never asked for silicone in the shower and it looks sloppy.  They also countersunk the tub and that wasn’t how it was designed to be installed.  We had an existing pocket door that just needed a new latch on it which they installed but now it’s off track and scratching the paint on both sides.  The only thing they are good at is reminding customers that a payment is due. I would not recommend Treeium to my worst enemy!"
5,"We found Treeium through Houzz. Salesman and Project Manager Avi Shushan was at our house a couple of days later, where he helped us put our remodel ideas together. This was our first remodel, and we were not sure what to expect. We had heard that contractors worked sporadically - but the Treeium experience was continuous. Avi always gave us a heads up on the schedule.  We had pleasant, skilled crews working on our home every day for a month. Avi also has a helpful designer's eye if you are doing your own design work and need a nudge. The stamped concrete guys are artists, as are the tile and paint guys. The results are gorgeous."
5,Guy gave us a bid we could live with.  The contract was clear and through the whole project was exactly as the contract stated.  Payments were easy to make online.  Guy was easy to work with and listened.  The work was done on time.  Antonio cleaned up every night.  Could not be happier with my new kitchen.  Best construction experience ever.
5,"Thank you Lior Lazarovich for a very professional job well done. 
  Lior was always available to us too answer all our requests and questions . Great job Lior, we wish you the best."
5,"Treeium and my project manager, Guy Breuer, really delivered on my bathroom remodel.  They were the 3rd quote I received and I found the fairest of all.  The project came in within scope, on time (actually a little ahead of schedule) and on budget.  Don't forget to include them in your project plan!!"
5,"We met with Erez to discuss our bathroom remodel project. He was very personable, knowledgeable and professional. After interviewing other companies we decided to go with Treeium and were very glad we did.
Erez and his crew did a great job. The bathroom looks awesome. The work was completed on time and the workmanship was top notch.
Would definitely recommend to our family and friends."
5,"Farid is spectacular.
He exceeded my expectations!
He is professional, artistic, punctual, dependable, timely and realistic.
He treats small projects with same respect and professionalism as a big project.
I know because we started off a tiny project but expanded it and are still so very thrilled.
I highly recommend him!! We are already planning phase 2!!!"
5,"We're in the process of doing a room addition to our new house, and recently signed with Treeium. Farid Ghaheri is managing the project and we can't praise him highly enough. From the very first meeting, he's been professional, articulate, and punctual -- most of the time he's early (very important to us, with our tight schedules!). Farid walked us through the entire process and timeline, and was always honest and realistic with his recommendations and estimates. Treeium in general has been wonderful to work with for several reasons: 1) their user-friendly and transparent online portal; 2) set cost; 3) versatility with adding to the scope of work; 4) their economy of scale, with several crews and professionals available to do whatever needs to be done, when it needs to be done. We discussed budget with Farid very early on, and by the time we got to the contract and detailed scope of work, the price he gave us was right in the initial range he quoted us. One of the best things about how Farid works is that he always has examples of recent or ongoing projects to illustrate his ideas; he's a wizard with his iPhone and laptop. Farid is extremely responsive to texts, emails, and calls, and always impresses us with how frequently he's available to swing by our home to discuss an idea or to check on someone's work. You're in good hands with Treeium, and especially with Farid."
5,Thank you for the initial information on how you work.  The video is also helpful. I look forward to getting a proposal.
5,"So far the kitchen is looking good.Daniel is very positive, friendly, and personable. We would recommend Treeium to others, they have a great quality assurance representative Darrell."
5,"Spoke with Nina who was very helpful and professional in answering a few of my questions and making me feel that working with Treeium could be a good fit for us. 
I look forward to our initial appointment next week to find out more. Thank you Nina"
5,Lisa was very pleasant to speak to. She was my first exposure to Treeium and gave me enough confidence in the company that I setup the initial appointment.
4,"Treeium and Itay, the Project Manager, were very good.  They came on time, fallowed all of my directions, came back promptly if I thought something else needed to be done, and completed the project within a decent period of time.  I would recommend them for bathroom remodels.  The cost was reasonable for the job done."
5,"We needed to remodel our 2 bedroom condo in Culver City and needed it done quickly because we were paying for two mortgages at the same time. Erez Shifferman came and after chatting for a few minutes with my wife and me he immediately understood our ideas and concerns and provided many helpful suggestions on how to save time and money with our project. Not only is he knowledgeable about all aspects of remodeling, but is also honest and upfront with all the costs. Some contractors might give you a low estimate at the beginning and surprise you with extra charges down the road, but this is never the case with Erez and Treeium because they are such a reputable and old company and they have an ironclad reputation to defend!"
5,"Amazing company to work with.
The crew is honest, reliable and professional.

The are prompt and always available if you need them.

I highly recommend Treeium."
5,"the workmanship is excellent.  all of the men were on the job on time, finished job in a timely manner--as promised.  house looks great.  so good i have just hired treeium to do another job for me, bigger than first.  i trust them to care for my home as i do.  farid, the project manager has integrity.  he looks out for me and my home as if it were his own.  he arrives for appointments when he says he will.  i couldn't be happier with the whole experience. i will use them again and again.  thank you, treeium team."
5,"I ordered a 308sqft aluminum patio cover to reduce the sun exposure on my back bedroom. Not only does the cover look great, but how things progressed was impressive. 
1. I was given an up front price that was in line with competitors. I chose them due to other good reviews they have had.
2. The project was timed and well managed by Erez, who coordinated the permit, the materials purchase and the installation. 
3. The installation passed inspection the first time and was well done. Built per plan. 

Overall this was was a very pleasant and efficient engagement of an impeccable business. I highly recommend Treeium."
5,"We just started working with Treeium in the preliminary phase and so far so good! They are extremely professional and timely. My husband and I just started the process, and, in the meantime, we won a $200 Amazon gift card by completing a survey for them! We were so excited! Adriana Villasenor and Don Mkhitarian hand delivered the gift card to our home and were super sweet and helpful. It’s safe to say we are looking forward to working with them and our project manager Don Mkhitarian!"
5,"Sam Deen and his crew did an excellent job in remodeling our master bathroom.  Everyone was very courteous, on time, cleaned the site daily and respected our work days and hours.  They made my dream bathroom come true."
5,"We recently had a bathroom remodel done by Treeium and were very happy with their work and especially with our project manager, Farid.  Their workers showed up on time, worked diligently on the project, and cleaned up each day when they were done.  Farid was on site every day to make certain the work was progressing, and he was also a huge help with the design details and in making sure everything was done to our liking.  The job was completed professionally and on time and looks great!  We would definitely give 5 stars to Farid and Treeium."
5,"Always a scary proposition trusting in a construction/remodeling company, but we really lucked out with Treeium. Initially contacted by Guy Breuer, who was to be the project manager on our master bath remodel. He gave us a quote that was far less than 2 other contractors and promised the work would be completed in 4 weeks. He lied. It was done in just under 3 weeks!! 
Guy was very helpful in recommending tile and bathroom fixture companies in the area and we found exactly what we were looking for (thanks Russ at Modello Tile). What I really think made all the difference was the crew that we had for our project. Shout out to Miguel, Liverado and the rest of Juan's crew, true craftsmen. Clean, efficient and showed up every day until completion.
Truly an amazing and easy experience. I strongly suggest at least making Treeium one of your quotes."
5,"Ashley was very professional, reviewing my remodeling needs and scheduling a project estimator to meet with me.  Selection will be based on proposal."
5,"The Irvine team, headed by Farid are so professional. I appreciate all the workers from the demo team to the tile men to the plumbers. They are polite, personable, receptive to questions and input, clean up when they are done and very good at what they do. You will not regret hiring this team. Kara"
5,Tomer is remarkably reliable and responsive.  He conducted himself and subcontractors in an effiicent and professional manner.   We will be using Treeium and Tomer again soon.
5,"After interviewing several contractors, for a kitchen remodel, we awarded the contract to Treeium, and I am glad we did.

From the onset, they were professional, clean, neat, reliable, and the end result is an amazing kitchen that we love.

Our Project manager was Assaf Labi.  He and his team of experts came in measured drew and gave us a quote.  From start to finish Assaf coordinated everything.  We talked to him on a daily basis.  He texted to make sure all was clean when the crew left for the evening.

I was amazed that even during the demolition phase, there was no dust in adjoining rooms.  They had the place sealed tight.

The quality of our cabinets is outstanding and the workmanship for installation if perfect. Their designer came up with different ideas.  We kept making changes until we were happy.  She knew her stuff.

I highly recommend Treeium for any remodel you want to do.  They are a reliable company.  With all the nightmares you hear about contractors, we did not experience any problems."
5,"I first met Guy Borenstein and then he became like a brother figure.  He came, inspected, gave an estimate, brought the crew, and did the job on time and as per their estimate.  I definitely recommend him and Treeium for any renovation or upgrade you need around your house."
5,"When I decided to remodel/enlarge my bathroom and build new closets, I wasn't sure I'd find someone who can build exactly what I wanted, especially since we had to deal with HOA rules and CCRs 
Erez Schifferman ruled over the job and dealt with all the hiccups that always happen when remodeling and construction is done, in a very professional and friendly way. I'm not sure I would've survived this without him being on top of all of it. Oh and I'm quite surprised that he survived my complaining during the last 3 months"
5,"I’m so over joyed with the experience we have had with Erez Schifferman!  He hasn’t represented this company with outstanding professionalism, patience, and motivation.  We had a terrible experience with a different company so we were very nervous about dealing with contractors once again but Erez has made sure that all our questions have been answered and had reassured through the project!  We’re almost done with our project and are overly pleased!"
5,We had our front and backyard re landscaped with drought tolerant plants and materials. Erez Shifferman was responsive to every request we had to make our yard perfect. When there were questions /problems ( as there are with all construction projects ) Erez was available immediately  and addressed every one in a timely and in a more than satisfactory manner. I would recommend Erez Shifferman and Treeium for any and all of your home remodel needs.
5,"We hired Treeium to remodel our master bathroom. Guy Borenstein was very easy to work with and followed through with us every step of the way. The crews were professional, did good work were friendly and always cleaned up after each job. Our remodel was done in a timely manner and we are very pleased."
5,"So far Treeium and our head contractor, Guy Borenstein, have done an amazing job on our open concept kitchen remodel. And we are not easy customers! We had load bearing walls removed, beams placed within the ceiling, concrete footings poured under the house, our hardwood floors seamlessly matched to run from the living room into the kitchen, drywall on the walls and ceiling is perfectly flat, and all has gone smoothly. Meanwhile we are still living in the house so they sealed off the rest of the house with zipper entry doorways, and the dreaded dust that we were so afraid of has been kept to a minimum. They are even sticking to their budget and timeline. I’ve been warned these days that is not to be expected! We should know because we have experienced the worst with other contractors.  So I feel the need to shout off the mountain tops how awesome these guys are. We can’t wait to see the finished product!"
5,"We just had our house remodel completed by Treeium and we couldn’t be happier.  We started with the kitchen demolition which honestly made my wife cry.  But the kitchen that was built in its place is like a dream come true.  Our Project Manager, Lior Lazarovich took our old tired kitchen and gave us a new house.  I can’t believe this is the same house we lived in for 7 years.  I’m truly blown away by the quality of their work.  5 Stars all the way.  Thanks again Lior Lazarovich and Treeium."
5,"One of the greatest experiences I has while remodeling my home. Great company, great customer service and workmanship. I was very impressed by the professionalism of my project manager, he managed my project which was a gate replacement and a kitchen remodel in a very timely matter. I'm very happy with my decision and would highly recommend this company to my friends."
5,"There were some problems and delays.  However, they promised to complete all punch list items by December 11, 2017.  It is extremely satisfying to receive clear commitments from Treeium!"
4,"I don't think any contractor is perfect and deserves 5 stars since there is always room for improvement.  But, we are very happy with Treeium's work and the results of our project.

We completed our house remodel with Treeium in April 2017.  It was an extensive project requiring us to move out of the house for 8 months.  We added a bathroom, shifted the location of our kitchen, completely rebuilt an old addition with new vaulted ceilings, upgraded all the electrical, new HVAC, and tankless water heater.

We found Treeium on Home Advisor and selected them for these reasons:
1.  They are a local company, which made communication/meetings very easy.
2.  We liked the idea that they did not sub out their workers.  The same foreman, Mika, and his crew of 5-6 guys were here throughout the entire project, with additional specialty contractors such as electrical, tile layer, HVAC installer.
3.  The salesperson, Guy Borenstein, was very good-natured and we thought he would be an easy person to work with.  Turned out to be true.
4.  They could also take care of the engineering plans and we would not have to hire a separate engineer/architect.
5.  They state that the customer will not incur additional costs above the initial bid for contractor mistakes or misjudgments.  This was absolutely true.

While I don’t think that any construction projects are perfect and without stress, we were generally pleased with Treeium for their work ethic and attention to customer expectation.  They were very efficient during the work schedule and we were consistently updated with the progress.  Any mistakes/errors (which are inevitable) were quickly taken care of.  We are truly enjoying our newly remodeled home and have referred Treeium to several of our friends interested in remodeling their homes.

Our biggest complaints would be the following: (1) they were sometimes insensitive to our schedules (asking us to immediately run out and purchase items needed for the house); (2) the communication between various workers/crew was sometimes lacking; (3) more time and attention could have been paid to drywall finishing; and, (4) the crew could have done a better job maintaining our existing landscape (we are still digging concrete pieces and construction debris out of our lawns).  Fairly small issues considering the scope of our project.

Overall, I would recommend Treeium for your house project.  Compared to the nightmare stories I have heard about other contractors, Treeium is a reliable company and genuinely tries their best for the customer."
5,"FANTASTIC AND FOLLOW UP!  I highly recommend Treeium.
We used Treeium to renovate our kitchen.  I got bids from 6 different companies and Treeium was neither the least nor the most expensive.  But, Ron was able to show photos of previous work and also seemed the most sincere.  We needed to have the kitchen finished in 5 weeks as we wanted it done before we moved into the house.  Ron and his team finished the job on time and within the budget.  
They've come over several times to make the smallest of adjustments for me.  As a matter of fact, 4 months after the job, the kitchen faucet was loose and Ron sent someone to fix it and at no charge.
We plan on renovating our baths soon and Ron and Treeium will be the first team we call."
5,"We had an entire house remodeled and worked with PG Mr Ron Amondy and Mr Allan Nagar. They and their crews were professional, punctual and responsible the whole time. The quote was also closed to the actual cost at the end. We were happy  and satisfied with their service and will highly recommend them to anyone who need a remodel service."
5,"Assaf was my project manager. He did an outstanding job. My kitchen and bathroom were totally gutted and remodeled. He is experienced, knowledgeable, supportive, and well organized. He kept constant communication with me throughout the construction process which I appreciated. Assaf provided me with guidance when it was time to choose appliances, sinks, flooring, countertops, etc. 

I have a high end kitchen now that functions to meet my needs. My bathroom looks elegant. What a difference!
Yvonne"
5,"We had a master bathroom redone. Eli was tremendous as both a person and as a project manager. The work was all excellent and the process smooth. All details were thoroughly discussed and changes requested along the way were accommodated graciously.
All of the workers were pleasant and courteous. Definitely a recommendation from us!"
5,"Yay! I’m finally done with my project and I want to extend my sincere gratitude to Erez Shifferman & Treeium. Erez, you brought trust back to my realm of working with contractors, thank you so much for everything you’ve done for me! I interviewed Erez as a part of cautiously trying to commit to executing a general remodel that I was thinking of for a long time, and I immediately connected with him. I knew right then and there that I would work well with him because you definitely want to feel comfortable and communicate well with the person who is going to be in charge of your once in a life time remodeling project. In my opinion, this is true to any scale project, not necessarily an involved and longer one. 
Erez was able to show me his company profile, all of their contractors licenses and paperwork. This put my mind at ease and I decided to go with Treeium. Now, when the project is completed , I’m happy to say that the quality of the workmanship and attention to detail blow me away. I am very pleased with all of the work done. Erez was always available by text or phone call, and he spent a lot of time helping me make decisions and going over options. I never felt rushed or that my needs were not met.
The entire process went smoothly despite the fact that my daughter and I lived in the home the entire time. I even have two inside dogs and they always made sure to keep their water bowl full and put them outside and clean up when needed. Every room was transformed beautifully. It looks like a new home! Actually, the project took longer than expected because I ended up adding more and more to the original scope of work after I saw how smooth, worry free and well handled the process has been. I figured I might as well get it all done and finish my dream list. Communication was key for me throughout the process, and Erez masters that very well, regardless to what time the clock reads. Bottom line, I was very well served with nothing but professionalism, great quality of workmanship, communication  and honesty. Thank you again Erez & Treeium for a very well done job! I highly recommend Treeium and Erez for your home and all of your contracting needs. You won’t be disappointed!"
5,Treeium demolished our combination bathtub/shower in order to install a walk-in shower with a sliding door to accommodate my 84-year-old father who moved in with us. The shower is aesthetically very attractive and works well to meet my Dad's needs. The workmen were courteous and the project manager Erez was on top of the project and communicated well with us every step of the way.
5,"Treeium remodeled our kitchen and it came out beautifully. We found Treeium through Home Advisor. I wanted to remodel the old kitchen we had because I continuously kept getting splinters. So we remodeled with Treeium and our kitchen is simply amazing. Very impressed with the precision of the cabs & countertops. They made sure everything is sealed. If Treeium would make a mistake, they graciously corrected the concern. Very professional, hard working company. Communication could have been better between labor workers. Overall the experience was great. Benjamin was the best project manager. He kept in touch with us, and addressed all of our concerns. Very punctual and communication with him was great. I definitely will consider working with Benjamin & Treeium again!"
5,"One word:   Excellent.  The renovation was completed with ease AND ahead of schedule.  The cost was relative to the renovation.  The project manager, Liran Avital, was extremely valuable.  He was at my disposal at any hour including, but not limited to 11:30 p.m., when I could respond to various forms of communication.  Mr. Avital took very good care of my investment.  His foreman, Caesar, and his crew were extremely tidy, diligent, meticulous and patient in every aspect of the renovation.  If Caesar had a question about the design, he asked and fully understood sometimes vague instructions.  The designer, Natalie, did a fabulous job on suggesting the appropriate backsplash, cabinetry and appropriate handles.  The kitchen cabinets are self-closing with a spice rack and lazy Susan contained therein.  Treeium was an excellent choice."
5,"Treeium provided us with excellent, tasteful kitchen and bathroom remodelIng within our budget.  Our condo is now stylish and ready for rental!  Prior to contacting Treeium, we had gone through the estimation process with two big box companies, which we decided not to use because of their ""out-of-a can"" offerings and dishonest estimation practices.  From telephone reception to oversight to the finishing touches, Treeium was professional, expeditious and friendly in their dealings.  Project Manager Guy Breuer warmly walked us through the entire process, explaining what sorts of things might be discovered that would affect the scope of work, and therefore cost.  He and his team of excellent contractors not only carried out the work, but also made important aesthetic suggestions based on their experience.  We are very happy we went with them and would not hesitate to contact Treeium again for any remodeling work!"
5,My experience with Treeium was great. My project manager was Lior Lazarovich and he was great . I will most likely choose Treeium for future renovations. I have no complaints for Lior. He did an amazing job assisting my needs and addressed all my concerns.
4,My name is Ben. I had my sons fiancé's kitchen remodeled and I have to say everything went ok. I had to leave town for a weekend and project manager Lior was amazing at managing their renovation. I had left specific instructions to install a delicate vintage style stove to their kitchen as a wedding gift. Everything went great! And they're very happy and satisfied with the remodel.
5,"Treeium and Erez Shifferman our project manager were amazing! We’ve suffered through way too many hot summers in our own home until we just couldn’t take it anymore. We met with several companies in the process of trying to wrap our heads around costs and different solutions for our needs. Erez stood out from the crowd right from the get-go with professionalism, communication, honesty and overall good vibe. We were very impressed with his expertise, knowledge and how he carried himself overall. Erez kept in touch with us after our initial meeting and made us feel very comfortable towards the next meeting we lined up with him to go over specifics of the project and get everything going. Erez delivered everything he promised and I simply can’t believe how smooth our project was handled considering all the elements of the project, which included removal of a giant 50ft tall tree, re-insulating our attic including 2 attic exhaust fans, re-painting our entire house, installing brand new AC units in all the bedrooms and the cherry on the icing - 3,500sf of beautiful energy efficient drought tolerant landscaping that completely transformed our front and back yards from desert like no man’s land to beautifully designed yards we’re now proud of! We want to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to Erez, we’re truly blown away by the service and attention we received from him, we simply can’t imagine the process being any smoother or worries free than what it was. Now that the project is completed, we’re happy to contribute our review to the list of reviews Erez is so proud of, we now know he works very hard towards making his customers happy and satisfied so the least we can do is share our story with others - if you’re reading this review and thinking to work with Treeium, do yourself a favor and ask to meet with Erez, he’s a needle in a haystack!"
5,"We remodeled a second bathroom.  Complete gut job, changing bathtub to shower removing a soffit.  The project manager was Lior, who was excellent at communicating with us as the project progressed.  We are very happy with the result!"
5,"Erez Shifferman was our project coordinator. We moved out of state while the work was being done. Erez was great and very easy to work with remotely - he kept in touch regularly, also often sending photos of progress. He handled purchasing of items, so that we didn't have to worry about that. He gave us confidence that Treeium was doing good work while we were many miles away, and made it a stress-free experience for us.

After the work was done, we made a quick trip back to see it in-person. We were very satisfied with the overall quality of work by Treeium."
5,"When great work is combined with exceptional service the results is always fun.

The project is almost completed. A few minor changes need to be done; However Treeium did an excellent job. Took their time to bring the most out of the work and made adjustments as 

Based on the overall craftsmanship and the quality of each character, Gustavo (cab installer) Roy (electrician), Jaime (the painter) and Phillip (the tile man) need a raise. 

It is a pleasant home owner experience. Strongly recommend Treeium to do your remodel. They stand as a professional contractor because it is critical for increasing the value of your home. The RIGHT way

Have a great day.

5,"The last thing that you want to be told when you move into your new home is that you have mold and that they will need to test, isolate, rip out, and reconstruct the affected area. When that reality set in within a week or so after we had moved in, we were heartbroken. While it hurt, we knew that we needed to take care of the issue immediately. When we hired Treeium to perform the work, we were very impressed by Farid’s knowledge and experience. His explanation of the situation and what steps were needed to remediate were thorough and complete. Farid maintained proper communication throughout the entire project and the Treeium staff who performed the work were incredibly professional and skilled. We thank Treeium for making our home safe and healthy."
5,"I had Treeium remove my old HVAC and replace it with a new one. My project manager was Tomer Turjeman. He was truly fantastic to work with. He was very helpful in helping decide on the best approach for the install and was very diligent in following up with the details. On top of that, he was a great conversationalist and was very respectful and friendly with my mother (who is staying with me for a bit). She was at the house during the project and really enjoyed talking with Tomer. She commented many times on how great Tomer and the rest of the Treeium team were. Tomer is the primary reason for my 5-star rating.

The work was completed with high quality and the new HVAC works very well. This is the first summer at the house where we were able to keep it consistently cool. We're very pleased with it. My only point of critical feedback is that Treeium is on the higher end pricing-wise and I would have liked to see a more transparent breakdown of the job costs.  I did not decrease my rating for this, however, because it was ultimately my decision to move forward and the job came in exactly at the agreed upon cost.

Excellent work, Tomer and team! We're very pleased."
5,"I had the pleasure of dealing with Guy Borenstein in working on a
proposal that fit my budget and he did everything he possibly could to meet that criteria and I was satisfied with the final proposal. He is so honest and real and I truly appreciated that. Unfortunately for Treeium, I decided to sell my condo ""as is."" I love trees and I love the fact the Treeium plants a tree at the completion of each renovation. Wish I could have been part of that. I highly recommend Guy Borenstein in particular at Treeium and their spectacular work (as you'll see on their website). I could not have had a more pleasant experience."
5,"After several difficult attempts with other contractors for our kitchen remodel, we finally landed on Treeium, and the fantastic Project Manager Oshrat. She was very attentive, honest, and responsive. She addressed every question or concern I had along the way and completed to job in a timely manner. The project was only a partial kitchen remodel (new quartz counters, marble backsplash, new sink and faucet), but we were always treated us like a big-ticket customer. We went into the project with a firm budget and only had one surprise with some electrical work that needed to be done. Oshrat was always mindful of our budget and even with the extra expense we still ended up under budget. Allen and Marvin did a lot of the work for our project and did a great job. I tend to be a perfectionist and notice all the little things. Every time I pointed something out they were always quick to fix it. Even a few weeks after the project was completed, I found a few small things that were not to my liking. I texted Oshrat, and she was ontop of it and said they would fix anything that was not to my liking. I would recommend Treeium in a heartbeat!!"
5,"I have partnered with Treeium to acquire more clients with larger design projects. 
The team is very innovative, creative and thorough and I look forward to working with  them for their professionalism and follow up."
5,"Erez is the best! If you’re thinking to hire Treeium for your home remodeling project and you were lucky enough to meet with Erez, let me save you some reading time - all the other reviews Erez has online are 100% accurate and truly describe this fine young man. Now, when the project is completed, I am very pleased to add my own review! We hired Treeium and Erez to replace our roof after meeting with a few companies, but not feeling as comfortable with them both on the personal and professional side. Since we had a bad experience with a different contractor in the past, we were very picky and selective this time around.. Erez took his time with ease when he met with us (twice!) and explained everything thoroughly. After we awarded Erez the project, first thing he said to me was “now it’s time for me to start proving myself to you”, and this is exactly what Erez has done throughout the project. We passed all inspections on the first shot and now we can comfortably leave for our vacation as we were able to meet a very tight schedule for completing our project. Thank you Erez so much for delivering everything you promised and as well for a well done job!"
5,"I would highly recommend working with Guy Breuer from Treeium, Inc for any of your future home improvement projects. My wife and I had the pleasure of his help and services this past year on the construction of our addition. Guy was very helpful, easy to communicate with, and transparent with the project. He and his crew were very efficient and thorough when it came to executing each part of the job. They were all very respectful and friendly as well. I am happy to say that Guy and Treeium help to build a safe home for my family.

James, Alameda CA"
5,Talked to 2 contractors  and felt like they weren't listening to me.. I knew my budget and I knew what I wanted..  Was ready to just save my hard earned money and give up my dream addition util I met the 3rd  contractor Guy Breuer with Treeium.. He's not a sales rep he's a Project Manager and he gave me common sense options not UP SELLING options i didn't need..  I had a real good feeling about Guy and what he said Treeium would deliver . So I signed on the dotted line and now i have  my dream room addition.. He met all times lines and his work crew's were top notch.. Thanks Guy..
5,"My wife and I selected Treeium to paint the interior of our home and it was a great experience.  Guy Portal explained all of our options and was patient and understanding as we selected our color choices.  His staff performed flawlessly, completing the job on time and leaving our home clean and looking beautiful.  We wouldn't hesitate to consider Treeium again for future projects.

5,"Treeium was amazing! I was referred to them by a close friend that did a bunch of work on her place after a major water leak. She loved them and said they are very fast, have fair prices and are easy to communicate with.

I had a water leak in my tentants unit. I explained to them that my tenants wanted to get back in their home ASAP. They were constantly doing whatever they could to make things go faster. They said my project would be completed in about 8 days or so. They finished it in about 5 instead. Everything looks great! They went the extra mile and helped us find the best matching materials, they were easy to communicate with and answered every text and call within minutes. That is definitely not the case with most contractors. They under-promised and overdelivered on everything! Erez, The Project Manager, was amazing! He is very personable, went out of his way to help in any way he could. After this project, I honestly feel like I have a new personal friend. I would not hesitate to hire them again!"
5,"Liran Avital and the Treeium crew completed a full kitchen and bathroom remodel for us, and we are thrilled with the results! We have had some nightmarish experiences in the past so we were reluctant to take this project. After contacting Treeium  and meeting with Liran in person, he gave us all the confidence we needed, we interviewed 2 other companies before and after we met Liran and let me tell you this, no one were even close to the professionalism and the well established reputation Treeium have and the way Liran went through every aspect of the project with us. so we decided to move forward with Treeium and so glad we did! From the start, Liran patiently worked with us to draw up the plans, scope of work, budget and timeline. His expertise and suggestions made all the difference in ensuring we made the most out of the space we have. Liran was on site overseeing his crew for flawless execution. He lent his expertise in helping me select final touches like drawer pulls, kitchen faucets and lighting and bathroom layout and design. The crew was very  polite, nice and clean throughout the whole time of the remodeling. Every day I received emails or phone calls updating me what was happening, who was coming and going, when payments were due etc. I felt completely looped in and reassured at the overall coordination of all the people involved, everything Liran had promised he delivered! This is a top notch company and Liran was a fantastic project manager and was very easy to work with . The project was completed on time. Liran is honest, detail oriented and very professional. Thank you Liran and the Treeium crew for my new kitchen and bathroom. It was a pleasure to work with you. We highly recommend Liran Avital  and Treeium crew for smooth, peaceful remodeling process and quality work for everyone who is thinking to remodel his house!"
5,I hired Treeium for my remodeling project and couldn’t be happier with my decision. I had a wonderful experience with the company and my project manager Guy Borestein. He was always available for me throughout the entire process. He gave us an excellent customer service. Out project turned out great. Once again thank you Treeium for a job well done.
1,"We worked with Guy who is very personable, but the job that needed to be done took well over the time we were told  I understand that there are complications when doing a complex design, but the communication was horrible and took well over 6 months!   

We were very clear in our expectations and when it came to the build we didn't actually hire Treeium.  Their bid was more than $100K over what we were bid by other companies.  They tried to work with us and give us discounts, but in the end we went with another contractor.  

This is where things were very frustrating.  We were told the plans would be complete and ready to build.  There were issues with the plans that the contractor had to modify (simple measurements and walls where there couldn't be).  These small issues my contractor was able to work with the inspectors but the biggest issue was the retaining walls below our build.  They didn't put them where needed, nor tall enough and when we called them back to fix the problem, we were billed almost $1000 to fix!  We are still fighting them to not pay for this bill.  Instead of responding to us and fixing the problem they say we should expect changes!    I can see if we changed the plans  - but this was a blatant mistake by the engineer and we should NOT be billed because they did the plans wrong in the first place - DISAPPOINTING to say the least!  :("
5,"Up to this point am very happy with the work performed,Erez was there answering my questions and concerns,thank you"
5,"I’ve known Erez Shifferman for years now but I’ve never had the need to work with him professionally for any of the construction services he offers. When I learned Erez offers energy efficient upgrades as an energy upgrade California contractor and after discussing some ideas, I felt very comfortable with letting Erez perform the upgrades to my home. Needless to say, Erez made the experience flawless and super smooth even when I was out of state for the majority part of the work. Erez is one of those people you immediately feel like you can trust, as he’s a straight shooter, professional, personable and honest. My energy efficient upgrades are making a huge difference to my home and I’m very content with the work performed. Thank you Erez for making this happen for me and I’m happy we could do business together!"
5,"I acquired several bids to remodel my home and was very pleased to have contracted with Treeium, Inc.  My projects varied in expertise from building a second story wrap around deck, replacement of custom skylights, redoing the concrete driveway and other varied projects to bring my older home up to date.  Dotan, the Project Manager, was professional, knowledgeable, organized, and made time to make sure I was updated on all facets of the project, including communicating with me outside of business hours.  Furthermore, the Treemium team was pleasant, courteous and respectful of my property.  I would recommend them to anyone who is considering remodeling their home and would hire Treeium, Inc. again."
5,"Excellent job was done by Treeium & their crew. After looking around for over 3 months for a good contractor, I was finally referred to Treeium. Their project manager was friendly, knowledgeable, professional and most of all honest!! Absolutely no pressure tactics which made me feel comfortable with him. We decided to go with them to remodel our kitchen & do some landscaping in the backyard. They installed artificial turf and water-conversant plants and now my backyard looks beautiful. My kitchen was really old, needed everything updated. They gave me new cabinets, countertops, tile, and lighting. It literally looks like a new house and my friends are always astonished when they come over. 

I want to personally thank Treeium for the help and making this whole process easy. You took care of absolutely everything and your entire crew was very nice and polite the whole time. Don't know what I would've done without you. I'll definitely recommend treeium to everyone!"
5,"I found Treeium and hired them for a full high-end remodel of an existing 2,600 SF home in Playa del Rey, which was an investment/flip. They were well-priced, fair, very experienced and their workmanship was exceptional. They have multiple offices and a large staff, which was comforting to know going into the job. Guy Barnea and Ron Admony both acted as the PM's and they were fantastic. They were easily accessible throughout the entire process and the only change orders we had on the job were for scope that I decided to add at my own discretion. Would definitely use again."
5,"I did a complete remodel of a mobile home in Camarillo Springs (where you own the land), with Treeium. They did an amazing job and the service and quality were all amazing. They took everything down to the studs and built a home that you would NEVER know now is a mobile home. Ari and Guy were amazing and took care of everything from beginning to end! 
I highly recommend them!
Doris S."
5,"I was refereed to Treeium by a friend of mine because he had heard the horror stories I've had with other contractors in the past. He told me they were professional, reliable, and high quality..and wow he was right! Best remodeling experience I've ever had. We did a complete new roof for our home and it came out beautiful. All the workers were very friendly, and I was constantly kept updated as the project was progressing. I strongly recommend Treeium and will for sure be using them again."
4,"After waiting approximately 12 to 13 years to make a decision to semi-remodel our 1947 kitchen, we found ourselves hunting for the right company to perform high quality work for us in a timely fashion. We interviewed approximately 6 to 7 companies and we decided to award the contract Treeuim to do the work.  Our project manager is Guy Bornstein and I can't say enough about his enthusiasm and professionalism! He represents his company well, and while we are in week two of our remodel so far most everything is going well and I can't wait to update our friends & family when everything is finished!"
5,"Guy Borenstein is the guy you want leading your project!!!!! I can't say enough about him and his crew. An absolute professional. Everything was done within the time frame he gave us and was done with the highest standards. My new kitchen looks amazing. His crew was very nice, polite, and worked so hard to get the job done. Guy was always in contact with updates on the remodel and there at anytime to answer any questions I had. His ideas really made a difference in the way the kitchen came together. His knowledge and vision made working with him so easy. The kitchen is now the place where we spend all our time. Couldn't be happier. We plan on doing more work to the house later and I wouldn't call anyone else."
5,"Treeium Inc was hired to replace my problematic flat roof and the job was very well done. We passed both inspections first strike and overall we're very satisfied. So much can be said about a roof job other than it looks good, but definitely plenty can be said about the project manager behind the scene who made it all happen, Erez Shifferman. I've been around for a while to know that Erez is a rarity in the construction industry. His integrity, communication skills and attention to details are something to take pride in, and his company should know about it. Erez brings to the table everything he promises and it is obvious he cares about what he does, how he does it and who he does it for. I'm not sure how many project managers Treeium employes, but if half of them are carved from the same material Erez is carved it is crystal clear to me how Treeium was able to be featured in magazines such Inc 500 and Forbes. It's all about the individuals behind the scene…. All the power to you guys!"
5,"I was looking to have my windows and slider door replaced. I interviewed a few different companies and then met with Treeium's representatives, Rose Chang and Neev Kugel. They were very professional from start to finish. My biggest challenge was finances and Rose and Neev were able to assist me by setting me up with the HERO program. They were extremely honest and explained everything to me before we proceeded forward with our agreement. Throughout the whole process they kept me updated regarding everything that was happening and about to happen. They were onsite to supervise and keep the project on schedule. I was so pleased with the service that I decided to have them do my exterior paint of the house. It was overall a wonderful experience and I would strongly recommend Rose and Neev and the Treeium team for anyone considering with a quality company. Thank you Rose and Neev!!!"
5,"We hired Treeium for partial renovation of our house which included remodeling of the bathrooms, replacement carpet with hardwood floor and porcelain tiles, painting walls, ceiling, windows (inside and outside), doors and some cabinets, and replacement and installation of new fans, lights, switches, circuits, plumbing, and air-conditioner duct covers. One of the challenges was that we did not move our furniture and boxed staff out of the house, and the team kept moving all those around and disassembled and reassembled furniture as it was necessary. We even managed to stay at home for the first two-three weeks of the renovation. In agreement with Treeium, we chose the option to select and buy vanities, air-jet bath tub, faucets, and such materials as floor wood and tiles by ourselves. Shower glass-doors, LED lights, and miscellaneous parts and materials were provided by Treeium. 
Project manager, Lior Lazarovich, leaded the team very professionally, friendly, and flexible. He tried to satisfy all our requests. He was in touch with us on a daily basis, or more often when it was necessary.  In his messages, he updated us every evening. Seeing the high quality of the team work, we asked to add to the project some extra work that we initially did not considered.  Lior explained all our possibilities and helped make the proper choices.  We have never experienced any push from him.  Despite of the additional work, the project was completed in time. The team worked on Saturdays and sometimes on Sundays. We also thank Carlos Escrobar for high quality and optimal solutions.  Thank you, guys, very much!
Half-year later we are still very satisfied with the work done by Treeium.  All neighbors, friends, and other visitors to our house, who had seen the house before the renovation, are usually impressed and comments positively. Some told us that we are lucky to find such a company. All renovated entities still look nice and work properly. The only necessary replacement was a malfunctioned LED light, which Treeium quickly replaced without any charges after my single call to Lior.  We want to thank Lior again for his fine work and customer oriented attitude, and Treeium management for organizing such a good company."
5,"We hired Treeium for whole house renovation. We just bought this old condo, and nothing had been updated at least 15 years. Our project manager was MIKE, he is very responsible, whatever or whenever we needed to talk to him, he responded quickly. Even a little problem, he took care of it immediately. And his team, they're all awesome! They work hard, and make sure everything works and looks great. I honestly some of other contractors might do their work cheaper, but comes to the quality of work, can't beat Treeium. Now our condo came back to life and looks like a new one. Thanks to MIKE and his team!"
5,"Treeium provided & installed beautiful energy efficient windows and a sliding door in our home and we couldn't be happier over all.  Erez Shifferman who worked with us as the manager for the project is an honest, professional and extremely easy to work & communicate with. The service he gave us was superb and we can't imagine being treated any better. I already have a few family members lined up to check out my beautiful new windows and sliding door, so we hope to refer more business to Erez and Treeium in the near future!"
5,"I hired Treeium, Inc to take care of my leaky deck and planters after having water damage due to bad original design and construction of the deck/planters. The project manager who met with me (and later on was responsible for my project) was Erez Shifferman. As opposed to another company that offered a partial fix to remedy the problem, Erez suggested a different approach of redoing the deck entirely to make sure we're not just masking the problem but actually taking care of it from the root. Although the price point was higher than the other company (for the obvious reason that the solution/scope of work suggested by Erez was much more involved), I felt that this would optimally be the better approach for my piece of mind. Overall and throughout the project, Erez kept me involved on a daily basis with pictures and updates and made me feel at ease that I was being taken care of. Erez made sure to keep superb fluent communication with me and I can honestly say that my experience with Treeium as a company and Erez as the project manager who ran my project was flawless, smooth and stress free. It was very noticeable that Erez genuinely went the extra mile for me and you can tell he's just that type of a professional person who would do the same for all of his clients. I was really impressed as well with their headquarters office and operation when I came in to sign the paperwork, you can definitely tell that they're a top notch company that takes great pride in their customer service and quality of work. No more working with shady companies that operate from PO boxes...
I am 100% satisfied with the service and quality of workmanship I was provided with, and would definitely recommend Erez & Treeium to whoever I know who might be in need of any construction service. Thanks guys!"
5,"I hired Treeium Inc. for my much needed energy efficient upgrades around the house which included a complete replacement of my roof and windows. The project manager who worked with me was Erez Shifferman, a true professional, easy going, friendly and caring person whom I knew was going to take care of me and my project from the first time we sat by the table. Sure enough, I was right. My project was ran seamlessly, smoothly and with no glitches whatsoever which is a rarity in the construction world. I can already tell how much of an impact my new roof and windows are having on the temperature and comfort inside my home. Thank you Erez for delivering everything you promised, I will be more than happy to refer you to anyone I know who might be able to benefit from your outstanding service."
5,"Treeium to the rescue!!  I had the BEST Project Manager Lior Lazarovich.  He was patient, kind and very quick to respond to my calls.  Lior and his crew came in to start My Complete Kitchen Remodel on January 9th.  Along with the Kitchen remodel on January 11th Treeium replaced Two Sliding Glass Doors and Three Windows!!!  All these guys were no nonsense take care of business workers.  Everything was done fast, clean & efficient! I was simply amazed at how everything was planned out like clock work (Boom, Boom, Boom).  The organization that Lior maintained with his crew and keeping my sanity in check throughout all this activity was BRILLIANT!!  My finished project was realized on February 8th. My dream has come true!!!  I would definitely call Treeium again for another project without hesitation!!"
5,"We were looking to have a Solar system installed on our home as our electric bills started to escalate drastically over the years. We interviewed a few companies to have this project done including Treeium. Treeium sent out their Solar Specialist, Mr. Neev Kugel, to assess our needs and discuss the effects and benefits of going Solar. Upon meeting Neev, we felt very comfortable with him and immediately noticed that he was far more knowledgeable regarding Solar than any other representative we had met before. He explained everything to us, he let us know ahead of time that we will need to upgrade our main electrical panel as a part of the Solar installation (something that no other representative had mentioned before) and he told us exactly what we should expect throughout each stage of this project. 
Later on, we were even more satisfied and confident in our decision of choosing Treeium and Neev as they found out that we had an open permit with our county for a patio project we took on in the past. The permit was never finalized and had we not met Neev on time, we would have paid a heavy fee to the county for not dealing with this properly. 
Neev assisted us with taking care of this, he took care of the Solar and electrical panel installation, and made sure to visit the project often to make sure everything was done according to his standards. 
It was a really great experience working with Neev and the Treeium team on this project. We were definitely impressed by the professionalism and the integrity that both Treeium and Neev held.
We recommend Treeium to anyone considering a home remodeling project and we strongly recommend that you ask specifically for Neev should the company allow. You won’t regret it. Thank you Neev and Treeium for all that you have done for us."
5,My overall experience with Treeium and Guy Breuer was fantastic. They made me feel at ease with peace of mind though out the duration of the kitchen remodel by letting me know what they were doing or going to do at the end of everyday they were here. I felt very comfortable and trust Guy Breuer and his team with my home when I leave the house to go shopping for Christmas gifts. The kitchen remodel was completed a little over 3 weeks just in time for my birthday on Christmas. I would recommend Treeium and Guy Breuer and his team if you’re considering getting a kitchen remodel.
5,"It was time for us to go through a roof replacement, and being something we never plan to do again, we were very picky in selecting the contractor who will do the job for us. When we met and talked to Erez Shifferman with Treeium, he immediately ""stood out from the crowd"" with his friendly personality, high energy, good vibe and real world professionalism. Erez is a true asset to his company, you could really tell he cares for his customers, loves what he does and takes pride in who he does it for. Erez explained to us in detail the process of replacing our roof, he stood up to his word and provided everything he promised. We certainly had an excellent experience with Treeium as a company and Erez as an individual, and we will definitely recommend him to anyone we know who might need any construction services. A+++ all the way!"
5,My second project with Treeium was exterior painting for my house. It turned out excellent the colors were great. The work on the trim was very precise. Don the project manager was thoroughly professional & always on time. We are very happy with the work.
5,"Treeium did work on my home for my windows, air conditioning and some roof work. The project manager they assigned to me was Avihen Levanon and he was great. Everything was explained thoroughly and my family and I are very satisfied with the finished work. We didn't really have any issues come up which was surprising due to horror stories we've heard with some other remodeling companies. I definitely recommend Treeium to anyone looking to do work on their home"
5,"I was in the market for a complete bathroom remodel and a small bathroom upgrade. I checked out a few companies and after careful consideration decided on Treeium. After meeting with Raz, I was so impressed with his knowledge and professionalism that had no problem in making my decision to have them do the work. The workers have been efficient and have been meeting their deadlines. We're actually ahead of schedule, which makes me very happy. I would definitely recommend their services for any home renovations."
5,"My husband and I wanted to add living space to our living room. I found Treeium on line and read their reviews.  I was impressed with the information. Treeium has it's in-house engineering and architectural department which helped us to obtain the blue print and the permit for the construction.  Our project manager, Don, has communicated through-out the planning process and has done a great job keeping us updated on the progress. I'm very excited to get our project started. 
     Our project is now completed and I can't tell you how wonderful it has turned out to be.  I wanted the wall moved out to give 230 sq. ft. of extra living space.  Everything I envisioned  from the day we started the planning process and by the end of the complete the results were higher than my expectations.  My neighbors have watch the progress and are awaiting to come over to experience the completed addition that has completely change my living room, with a bay window looking out into the patio/back yard.  
       Don, project manger, communicated throughout the entire project on the daily duties, worked closely with his foremen to insure great workmanship, quality assurance and he takes a lot of pictures. I recommend Treeium as a qualified contractor/re-modeler.  Make sure to ask for Don, the big Russian Armenian gentleman.  We love our remodel."
5,"Beyond satisfied with the work Treeium did with our new windows instalation for my home.
They got the work done fast , very friendly and welcoming team.
Erez has an amazing energy, and great personality. He explained to detail the process for us to qualify to get our windows changed. Any question we had , he was able to answer and get us out of dought. I recomend treeium they did an amzing job and are looking out to help home owners improve their homes"
5,"I was looking to upgrade my master bathroom as it was pretty old. I met with a few companies and decided to hire Treeium mainly because of their reputation and the professionalism of the project manager they sent over, Neev Kugel. He was very knowledgeable and managed to discuss everything in detail: scope of work, timelines, pricing, etc. I have never gone through a process like this before and Neev was able to simply break it down in a way that didn’t leave any room for questions. I was extremely impressed by his attention to details and little did I know how this would play a major factor throughout the remodel itself. He was on top of the project at all times and made sure I was always aware of what was going on in my house. When we met, Neev prepared me that this project would take anywhere between three weeks to a month. Imagine my surprise when the whole remodel was done and over with in two and a half weeks! I was so pleasantly surprised that I decided to hire Neev and the Treeium team to also take care of my Kitchen. I met with the Treeium designer and similarly to the bathroom job, the Kitchen was completed in a timely fashion and the end result came out beautiful!
To whomever is reading this review, don’t waste your time by looking anywhere else. I strongly recommend Treeium and specifically Neev Kugel to take care of any of your remodeling needs. They did an amazing job for me and I know that I will hire them again in the future! Thank you Treeium and a special thanks to you Neev for making this process so easy for me and for delivering on everything you had promised!"
5,"We had a great experience with Treeium. We had a larger island built in the kitchen of our new home. They did a great job matching the material to the existing finish and they deliver it within the promised time frame. Erez Shifferman was our project manager. He is very personable guy and understood our needs from day one. Erez work hard to ensure that everything was not less than perfect and always kept us informed about how everything was progressing. The project involved the demolition of our old island, fabrication of a costume island, electrical work, and installation. 
I highly recommend this company and we will definitely be using them for other projects we have in mind."
5,"We had a leak in our 2nd bathroom. I saw that Treeium had great reviews. We reached out to them and we were contacted by one of their Project Managers, Lior Lazarovich. We decided to replace our bathtub with a shower and replaced the toilet, vanity and flooring. We agreed on contract terms and Lior called their tile & flooring partner to make an appointment so that we had access to Treeium pricing. Our entire remodel was seamless from beginning to end. But what made our experience exceptional was having Lior as our Project Manager. He communicated next steps to us on a daily basis. We always knew where we were in the process. Lior also had a Supervisor, Gady onsite to oversee the crew. Gady was also communicating next steps. And if you have never installed a shower, there are many steps. We passed inspection with no issues because Doing things right is a priority for Lior. Lior has great passion for his work and this shines through in everything he does. We are looking forward to remodeling our master bath in the future. Our first call will be to Lior. We highly recommend him & his team! Laurie & Mike from Irvine."
5,I had a smell in my basement and my friends advised me that it may be mold. I went on home advisor and Treeium was the first company that showed up. The representative was Don Mkhitarian. He was very knowledgeable about the field and helped us with a mold test. The test results came back positive. I appreciated the fact that Don communicated with us through out the process and he explained the different types of mold that we had and the health hazard that each were responsible for.  We are very happy to take action with Treeium and looking forward for Don To help us with the remediation process. I recommend Treeium to all home owners.
5,"Was referred to Guy Borenstein by a friend who had a similar project done and was happy with the work. He has been responsive, work began on time and the workers have been clean and prompt. Completely renovating a bathroom from the studs out, so far all has gone as promised and on schedule."
5,"I was looking to increase the energy efficiency of my house as it was poorly insulated. I called a few companies and decided to hire Treeium to conduct an energy audit for me to better understand what I can do to improve my home. Upon receiving the energy audit results, I met with Treeium’s project managers Neev Kugel and Avihen Levanon to go over the scope of work involved with the energy audit results. I was so impressed with their knowledge, demeanor, and the fact that I didn’t feel pressured to do anything, that I decided to go ahead and hire them to do the work for me which included: wall and attic insulation, exterior paint, main electrical panel upgrade and replacing my windows. Neev and Avihen made sure to always keep me posted regarding the project’s progress, they were very quick to handle any issues which came up, and overall were extremely professional and efficient in making sure everything ran like clockwork. I was so impressed with their work that I decided to also hire them to take care of my front yard and install drought tolerant landscape for me, and I must say that it came out BEAUTIFUL!
Thank you Neev and Avihen for your continued care and service throughout this project. It was a pleasure working with you and I would strongly recommend Neev, Avihen and Treeium to whomever is considering going through their next remodel!"
5,Erez Shifferman and the Treeium team have been a pleasure to work with.  Their professionalism and attention to detail make any project easy. We are looking forward to working with Erez again in the near future.
5,"Not realizing that windows would drastically help in our duplex's curb appeal, Erez Shifferman, our project manager suggested we consider the offer after explaining all the benefits of having new energy efficient windows installed. After much deliberation and Erez explaining to us the payment plan, we decided to give it a go. Erez was very attentive every step of the way, from explaining the paperwork to setting up an installation appointment that worked with our schedule. The windows installers were very handy and worked with all the clutter we had at the moment. The installation was swift and they accommodated last minute changes we made with the window plans. We instantly saw the difference and are happy with the work that they did. Would recommend to others, especially Erez our project manager, who after our installation came to make sure the job was well done and finish off any paperwork and any lingering questions we may have had. Thanks Erez!"
5,"Kelley here.
Guy Borenstein Was my contractor . He was recommended by a family member.  I got three estimates in this price range . Guy had the best price , but more he had knowledge and suggestions and facts that the others had not offered ! I felt that it would be a more professional job. The master bath is gorgeous and well constructed . We gutted it and the team with Maya , Lyle , Moses and Micha and the painter are all experts . They took me shopping and it was a group effort . They were patient with my artistic side .Thanks ."
5,"As a homeowner I usually don’t speak to people who knock on my door and offer services, but on that one day a young man, Erez Shifferman, knocked on my door with a smile and said they were working in my neighborhood (which they were). He introduced me to their company and what they were doing. Overall, Erez just made it easy for me to talk to him. I was badly in need of a new roof and decided to give it a try. After reviewing his company’s good history I decided to go with Treeium. 

I felt my service was excellent, the customer service and attention I received from Erez were really second to none. Throughout the project I felt as if I was Erez's only customer and his only running project, but I know I was not! I’m very happy with the service I was given and the new roof I have. I already referred Treeium and Erez to a few acquaintances and I will recommend them to anyone who needs work at their home. The project was efficiently completed on time and the results are excellent. Thank you Erez and Treeium!"
5,"It's a rare thing to find a company that offers top quality workmanship, excellent speed at getting the work done – and competitive pricing. Treeium has delivered on all of the above… and more! Our project manager, Erez Shifferman and his team have worked magic on my 62 year-old, ranch-style home. After initially stressing over the thought of hiring and coordinating 5 or 6 individual contractors for a long overdue remodel/renovation, we met with Erez – who presented my wife and I with an inclusive, energy-efficient plan to replace our cedar shingled roof, old wood windows and original wood siding with all-new eco-friendly products.

Erez was always either available on-site or by cell – and ALWAYS responsive to calls or texts throughout the day or eve (a perpetual fear of mine, after hearing various accounts of contractor-caused renovations-gone-wrong from friends and colleagues) to discuss project scheduling and milestones, or to address any personal concerns. From the demo stage to the final stucco applications, Erez would always check in with his team, then touch base with me with project progress and updates. Throughout the process, as I’m sure many homeowners are guilty of, my wife and I made personal adjustments to our project vision – to which Erez was equally gracious and accommodating. Among the many other favorable impressions made by team Treeium was the punctuality and the positive attitude of the crew – and if you happen to live in the SoCal region, be sure to request the ‘3 Georges’. IMHO, these guys bent over backwards to make our home remodel a pleasurable experience!

Our project is nearly done, the new exterior now looks practically brand new – and I couldn't be happier. Personally, I found Erez's professionalism to be truly extraordinary. He followed through on everything he represented – making sure everything was not just acceptable – but perfectly to my liking. In sum, I would recommend Treeium to anyone who wants their home to shine!"
5,"My wife and were planning on hiring a contractor that would help us with vinyl fence installation for our backyard. We had a few estimates already and wanted to get our third one as recommended. Our third appointment was set with Treeium. Treeium is a nationally ranked full remodeler that has all the licenses necessary to complete any home renovation project and is currently ranked 30th out of the Top 500 qualified remodelers Nationwide and that was the reason we contacted Treeium. We were very Pleased with the Project Manager Don Mkhitarian that came to see us. He was very Knowledgeable about every aspect of the job. He took his time to measure every detail as well as contact the Manager of the Vinyl fence department at Treeium ""Jack"" and review all the details that would be entailed  in the installation process. We thought Don was very Honest and Genuine with us. My wife and I are retired and we had a set budget for the project, but after the meeting with Don, we both realized that the Job entails more than what we thought. We thank Don for his input and Professionalism and we are going to restrategize our budget and hopefully have Don help us with the project at a later time."
5,Guy Kritshtein was our project manager and was terrific!  He was very personable and knowledgeable. Guy was always just a phone call away.  The remodeling of our kitchen and bathroom was completed without problems.  They are a real eco home remodeling company.  I will be using this company again when I redo the backyard.
5,"Five star rating!  My experience working with the Treeium Team, generally, and Project Manager, Eli Gerloy, specifically, was fantastic.  Eli oversaw a complicated kitchen/living area/bathroom remodel project at our home.  Eli provided us with a comprehensive plan and associated quote for the project and ensured that the our budget was maintained, despite a couple of plan modifications along the way.  Eli and his team were all very knowledgeable and responsive.  I highly recommend Treeium and will work with them again down-the-road.  If you choose to do so, ask for Eli - he will take care of you."
5,"Not realizing that windows would drastically help in our duplex's curb appeal, Erez Shifferman, our project manager insisted we consider the offer.

Would recommend to others, especially, Erez, our project manager. Who after our installation, came to make sure the job was well done and finish off any paperwork and any lingering questions we may have had. Thanks Erez!"
5,"I've contracted three projects with Treeium, with Liran Avital as the project manager.  The first and most ambitious was a bathroom renovation.  I did my own design for the bathroom, which ended up being more work for Liran and his crew than he was originally expecting. But even with the increased scope, he stuck to his original bid, and he got the project done within the time estimate.  The project turned out great; the bathroom is beautiful!  And I was really impressed with everone on his crew - just the right mix of professional and friendly, and proud of their craft (especially the guys who did our tile work!)  I'm not going to pretend everything was perfect - there were a few minor delays that could have been avoided, and on one of the smaller projects, a miscommunication about one of the materials used.  But weighing everything, Liran definitely earned a five-star review!"
5,"I interviewed quite a few companies to remodel my bathroom and upgrade my kitchen, when Don and Tomir came to give me a quote I was immediately impressed. From the beginning of the process I felt confident that I had hired the right team and I felt secure with Robert and his guys being in my home when I wasn't able to be there. Don and Tomir were always in contact with me and gave me a schedule so I would always know what was going to happen the next day, or in that week. 
I am very happy with the quality of the work and I know that if I ever have an issue with any of the work that has been done, I can text Don and Tomir and they will take care of me. I appreciate the attention and support I have had the whole project. Most importantly... I love my new bathroom and kitchen!!"
5,"I am very pleased with Treeium. My main contact was Guy Breuer who was very congenial and informative from the beginning. Guy originally set me up with Danny, who became my architect and worked with me to develop the plans for my addition. We added a garage, a bathroom, an extra room, and extended the front room. Danny took care of everything with the county and I only had to go to the county office once. The plans came out just the way I had foreseen. 

The cost was a little more than I wanted to pay but it was well worth it. From foundation to roof and everything in between supplies were top grade and so was the workmanship. I am very grateful for our foreman Angel, he and his crew worked every day, some weeks including Sundays to get my project done. And to top it all he and Guy kept me informed of their progress and what to expect the following week. 

Originally I was told that it would take 3 to 4 months, which was accurate since they finished in a little over 3 months and that was with a few delays caused by the rain.

I have received nothing but compliments from my neighbors and even random people passing by. Thank you Treeium."
5,"We were looking an energy efficient remodel that included air conditioning, new lighting, insulation and window replacement, a new electrical panel and were also considering solar. We turned to Treeium because we needed a contractor that was eligible to work under California's P.A.C.E. program (we went with Ygrene for financing), and could cover the full scope of services. My main points of contact were Neev Kugel and Ofer Dub. I found them to be both very responsive to our needs and schedule and pragmatic in their approach. The scope grew to include a rewire based on needs dictated by living in an old house, though they also recommended to wait for solar before understanding the new energy dynamics post-improvements, which insured the investment was going to the most needed items. Everything was seamless between Treeium and Ygrene. They went the extra mile to make sure we were satisfied with the work. Highly recommended."
5,"I am very pleased with the job Treeium construction and the help of the project manager Liran Avital did on my home.  The project included stone flooring, carpet, all new cabinetry and countertops.  My home looks amazing, because the meticulous work by this company and the expertise of Liran who made recommendations had the project move along quickly and oversaw work as it was being done."
5,From start to finish Treeium has made our visions a reality.. Equipped with highly trained professionals within the home renovation business they provided great service and products.
4,"We had a significant remodel on a house we just bought - some would say it was a ""gut"" job. I don't think a single room remained untouched and we even deliberately moved retaining walls and had to fortify in other areas as a result. Treeium came in very competitively priced and provided some legit references ultimately winning the business. The work done was solid and Ron Admony - who was our project manager - in particular should be singled out. He was on site frequently to supervise the progress, and made himself available practically 24/7 via phone or text. In many cases as addenda popped up he would work with us to keep the spend in line. Definitely ask for Ron on your project when you call them!"
5,"I would like to share my story, about my experience I had with Treeium.

I contacted Treeium to replace my soak in tub with a shower.
I have a medical issue with both of my knees and I am having a difficult time entering my tub. I am a retired veteran and have been doing physical labor throughout my life which causes my knees to ache. 

Guy Borenstein from Treeium came in to give me a bid on the project. Guy listened to my needs and advised me on what my opinion were. Guy's price was more than my budget which I can afford (I have not done any construction work for over a decade, I just couldn't afford it). And was not aware of construction prices in today's market.

I told Guy that I cannot afford to do the work at this time.
I could sence Guy wanted to help in any way he can, and he did smile emoticon

Guy asked if he could step out for a few min to speak to his office.After a few min Guy came in and explained to me about a program were Treeium gives back to the Community and there is a possibility that I could qualify to have my bathroom remodel done at no charge, and YES FREE!


We filled out the application and within a few weeks I found out that Treeum is going to sponsor my poroject and I will be receiving a new bathroom remodel at no charge . I never won anything in my life and can't believe this was happing to me.Within 3-4 weeks my bathroom was completed and it came out better then I ever dreamed of.

I want to thank Treeium and Guy Borenstein for making my life ""change for better""

 Sincerely,
 Allan and Terri Hewett"
5,"I love my new fireplace tile! I found Treeium on Home Advisor and from start to finish the experience was great. These guys are the real deal. I felt very secure that I was dealing with a legitimate company who has been in OC for many years (and who has tons of great reviews!) I love that they have in-house contractors for whatever job you need and don't hire sub-subtractors to get the work done. Both Don (Project Manager) and Robert (Tile Contractor) were amazing. Don kept in touch throughout the project and Robert went above and beyond to make sure the project was perfect. He also kept the workspace clean which was a bonus. Overall, thrilled with the results and LOVE THIS COMPANY! I will definitely call them again for my next project."
5,"A few months ago, my husband and I had Treeium remodel our Master Bathroom. Our Project Manager was Neev Kugel and he was absolutely phenomenal to work with. We couldn't be happier. So recently we decided to do a total remodel on our stairs too, so of course we called Neev at Treeium. Once again, he was excellent to work with. Our stairs were done beautifully and as always the customer service and quality of work were all at the highest level. Just like our Master Bathroom remodel, our Project Manager Neev Kugel was always on top of the project from start to finish. We have received so many compliments on our new stairs. Thank you Treeium, and even more specifically, thank you Neev!"
5,"We are very pleased with our new bathroom! Liran Avital was the project manager and he listened well to our description of what we wanted in the remodel. Each step of the project was carefully planned and carried out, and the finished room meets all our goals and expectations!

4,"My name is James Peery. I hired Treeium for a bathroom remodel. I went on Home Advisors and was given the name of three contractors. The only one who called me was Treeium. 

I was contacted by project manager Don. He showed up on time, was very interested in my needs, and gave me a quote. I found Don to be knowledgeable, polite, and most of all he was not ""pushy"" about me signing with Treeium. Don also made it a point to come by the project weekly to check progress.

I also dealt with Devon who works in client complaints and quality control. I found Devon to be a breath of fresh air who took care of all the issues I wanted addressed. Devon even called me on her day off to keep me up to date on the resolution of my issues. I wasn't having quality issues as much as I was frustrated with the length of the project and some other minor issues. Devon treated all my issues as if they were major and she was always pleasant. 

I also dealt with the field quality control manager. His name is Dror. He was awesome. He listened to my concerns, took pictures, and made sure all the work was done to his standards and mine. Dror was great to work with.

Overall my remodel turned out great. The price didn't change and the work looks awesome. I would recommend Treeium for anyone needing construction work done."
3,Very helpful and always great communication. The project managers were really wonderful and did their best to try and make sure things were as we wanted.
5,"Erez Shifferman, Sam and their Crew at Treeium showed up on time from day one. They are a very professional bunch. They took stress off my shoulders when it came to doing mold remediation in my Master Bathroom. Even though the job was small, they took it VERY seriously because the problem was serious. I really thank them all. His crew members were clean, fast, and they very reliable. I recommend them 100%. Erez was very helpful in explaining the work process. Every time I called or texted, he answered right away. They did an amazing job. Sam took it upon himself to make sure that the mold remediation when smooth and clean. Great job guys!!!"
5,We completed our project on 03-15-2016. Erez Shifferman project manager and his crew did an amazing job on remodeling our master bathroom. They converted a walking shower to a roll in shower and lowered one sink to make these wheelchair accessible. Erez Shifferman was very professional. He keep us informed and he help make this a good experience. we would recommend Treeium to others and have them request Erez Shifferman. It was a pleasure working with him..
5,"I just wanted to commend Treeium for an outstanding job. My husband and I have worked with a couple of different contractors and this is the best experience we have had by far. Our Project Manager, Neev, was so helpful. He was with us every step of the way. We never had to wait long for responses to our questions and he was always solution oriented. If we had a question, he had an answer. If we wanted something addressed, he made it happen. We truly felt like he had our best interest in mind. We never felt pressured, it was about what was best for us and our project. The execution and craftsmanship of our kitchen is beyond our expectations. We would highly recommend Treeium and Neev to anyone! He made the stressful experience of a kitchen renovation pretty pain free."
5,"great general contractor for big jobs, thorough bids submitted promptly. highly recommended. 

their project managers take full ownership of the bidding and supervising process. you can tell the employees have high morale and care deeply about their craftsmanship. 

for our project, they came through with a bid on the bathroom which was fair, but the kitchen was not reasonable. overall, they were 5k over the next lowest bid. Still, id consider hiring Treeium on future projects.. they were very honest and not afraid to put things into writing."
4,"We had a complete kitchen remodel done (changed layout, cabinets, flooring, lighting, etc), along with extra floor replacement in the hallway and family room. After interviewing 3 contractors, Treeium's project manager, Liran Avital, was the only one who really listened to what we wanted as opposed to what is typically done. He proposed options and considerations, and yes we had to make trade offs, but we are so happy with our new kitchen. They were very professional about presenting a visual design and juggling things around so we could make better design choices. The interior designer Michelle was helpful about promoting design strategies and guiding us in our decision making.  Norm, the foreman, was very on top of the progress and keeping us posted; he was always willing to address any of our concerns. The work crews / individuals were friendly, hard working, and clean at the end of every day. Treeium was very accommodating about incorporating things which were slightly out of original scope for no extra cost.  They approached complications with a positive attitude and changed things to satisfy our requirements.    They completed the entire project ahead of schedule . We would hire Treeium again for future remodeling projects."
5,"I just wanted to say, I LOVE the work this company has done!!!! Idan Navon was a helpful Production Manager walked me though the complete process. The workers on the house did a AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL job on the work done!!! They were ALWAYS on time & trusted my judgement on the tile, wood floors & marble counter tops! The workers even helped me pack up the house since I had school & work going on & couldn't do it myself. Treeium is even helping me finish the payments so I can finish paying for the job done. Yes, you will pay a little more for the work, SO WORTH IT FOR THE WAY YOU ARE TREATED!!!! They treat you like family. I would recommend then to ANYBODY who needs renovations!"
5,"We did a complete gut and remodel to our master bath.  We met with Kobi and Amir and hired them to do the job. We received the quality promised at the price promised. No hidden costs during or after. The finished product is just what we wanted, and looks beautiful. I would recommend Treeium for and remodel project you have."
5,"I had such a great experience working with this company. I hired them to install a pretty complicated banister (since the handyman I haired before had already done a lot of damage that needed fixed). The project manager, Guy, was truly fantastic! He walked me through the whole process, was always super responsive and made me feel super comfortable with everything. The contractor came by upon request after hours to answer some questions, and he noticed I was moving in and offered to help out with our move.  The crew worked long hours and late to get the job done before the deadline I needed and it looks incredible and feels super sturdy. I'm so glad I found them and plan to use them to remodel my bathroom next!"
1,"We were referred to Treeium from an online website.  During our initial phone call with them, they were very polite, friendly, and professional.  We told them were were looking to do a home addition.  We had no plans and no permit.  They said they were a full service company, which means, they can do the plans for us, get the permits, and build our project.  Sounds great.  They sent out an email and text to confirm the appointment time.

When their estimator arrived, it turned into a nightmare.  We showed him a rough sketched of what we were looking to do.  He didn't both looking at our sketched and told us since we had no plans, meaning blue prints and construction documents, he can't help us.  When I said we were very clear when we made the appointment, we do not have plans yet and Treeium would have us come up with one should we decide to move forward.  He was not happy with the fact we didn't have a plan, then he just threw out a number between $80k to $1`50k without even looking at what we wanted to do.

When I said, had I known they needed plans before they gave estimates, I would not have had them come out because it was wasting our and his time.  His reply, ""Yes, you are wasting my time.""  Those were his exact words.  After he said that, I sent him on his way.  He was only at our house for five minutes.  

I called Treeium back and informed them what happened.  The lady who answer the phone pulled up our request and she said it clearly stated we had no plans, no permits, and looking for an estimate.  She apologized and offered to send someone else out.  I was so upset at this point, I told her there is no need.

I took the day off from work, the appointment was at 10am on a Wednesday, to meet with them.  I clearly wasted a day of work for a fruitless meeting.  Poor service from their estimator, very rude and extremely unprofessional."
5,"My experience with Treeium and my project manager Ron Admony has been fabulous. I was lucky enough to have stubbled upon Ron and Treeium as they were finishing a remodel in my neighborhood and was so impressed with their work I went over to talk with Ron. He immediately came over to my house and gave me his recommendations for my remodel projects. Not only was I so pleased with his ideas, but also that he took time to come over himself as he said he would that I hired Treeium. They  have continued to offer amazing customer service and quality work.   I have used Treeium for my solar installation, remodeling of  bathrooms, replacing kitchen counters, interior painting, acoustic ceiling removal and electrical work throughout my entire house. Their staff shows up as scheduled, on time and will not leave until the work is completed to your satisfaction.  They all aim to please and will work with you to make sure the end result is what you want.  My project manager, Ron Admony,  is amazing and has become a true friend, always available for any questions or concerns and makes sure that the Treeium staff knows exactly what I am expecting.  I highly recommend Treeium and Ron Admony as your project manager for all your remodel needs, they will make any home project painless."
5,"This is a review if Sam Deen and his crew.  I'm in the middle of a bathroom remodel. I originally contacted Treeium for an estimate to replace a shower in my second bath. From the very start I was very impressed with Sam Deen the project manager. Not only did he arrive on time, he was amicable, yet professional. I need several repairs to my home, so after we walked through the bathroom I asked Sam to provide me with an estimate for the other projects. Not only did he provide me with an itemized estimate that covered everything, he also provided me with individual itemized estimates. Sam and I discussed my budget and agreed to start with remodeling the first bathroom. Never, have I experienced a contractor who listens and understands.  Sam made my best interest his first priority and not how much profit he could make. Sam is reliable, trustworthy and compassionate.  He understands the concerns, financial constraints and yes the anxiety inherent to remodeling. Sam  guided me through design, selecting the tile, fixtures, vanity, etc. He is 100+% dedicated to his customers satisfaction. I have become accustomed too and look forward to Sam's morning call and his. arriving in the morning along with which ever craftsman that is needed for the day.  On the rare occasions he is not present, Sam is on the telephone and/or sending a text message. If, I have any questions or need clarification he's a phone call away. I believe his leadership and presence has helped to the project on schedule. His crew is equally amazing.  They are focused and respectful of your home.  The work area is kept orderly and all traces of materials or debris is completely removed by the end of the day.  Words cannot express how satisfied I am so far.  I am confident  the finished project will be exactly what I expect.  If you're looking for a general contractor I highly recommend you call Treeium and  ask for Sam Deen . You want be disappointed.  I'll update this review when the project has been completed."
5,"I have decided to hire Treeium to do my Kitchen Remodel and I couldn't be happier! About a month ago I met who would later become our project manager, Mr. Neev Kugel, and our experience of working with him has been nothing short of great! His professionalism, experience, and attention to details is what made us decide to move forward with him to begin with, but boy, were we in luck! Neev kept us up-to-dated at all times throughout our project. He made sure all of his workers came on time and completed their job in a timely and professional manner. He went over and beyond to make sure we were happy at any stage of our project, and even included a few extra line items that were not even included in our original agreement. I was hesitant about who I was going to hire to do our project but I am so happy we eventually decided to pick Treeium and I'm delighted to have had the chance to work with our project manager, Neev.

Thank you Treeium for giving us the Kitchen of our dreams and thank you Neev for everything!"
5,"Our new kitchen is almost finished and we've been very impressed with the work of Kobi Farkash and his Treeium team since Day 1! They're organized, clean, communicative and keep to their planned schedule. The quality of the cabinets is excellent. The granite finishing work is fantastic. The onsite work quality has been very good and the workers seem to be proud of their work and like what they're doing. Kobi over-communicates - he texts every evening or morning to remind us what's happening the next day. If we've brought up something to him, his onsite worker knows almost immediately. Kobi has an answer for everything. He is a great problem-solver too - when something didn't quite look right, he came up with several solutions to choose from. We would highly recommend Kobi as your Project Leader!"
4,My bath remodel experience with Treeium was positive.  The crews at all stages of the remodel showed up on time each morning.  There were minor issues that came up but project manager Guy Barnea addressed the issues quickly.  I liked how I was able to order the vanity and tile with the contractor discount.  I received everything I asked for and the result is a bathroom I enjoy!
5,"My name is Pamela Van Horn and I've met Ron Poliker after I've signed a contract with another company. Ron have heard that I signed the contract yet came back after 5 hours to make sure I was not been taken advantage of. He came at 8 pm and reviewed the contract with me and pointed out that there are errors, over sites and over pricing. I contacted the other company and canceled the checks and Ron made sure they will not harass me any more. He gave me a much better price and much broader service. the crew was fast and professional, Ron came in every day and listened to my needs. He had a manage fly in from the head quarters in LA to look after the project. Ron is my guardian Angel!!! 
Thank you very much Ron Poliker!!!!!
Treeium is amazing!!!"
5,"We planned to have our kitchen remodel in late of 2014 with limited budget and had three estimated quotes.  We almost made up our decision with the 2nd contractor and went to his showroom to see and choose the cabinet's door with color & the counter top (our decision already decided before we have the meeting with Ron Admony from Treeium).   Ron Admony ""Project Manager"" from Treeium was the last one that contacted us for the third quotation and had an appointment which we thought we only gave two hours for his presentation as a social manner; but we ended up to pick Ron from Treeium EVEN with highest price of the three quotations.  We are very happy that we picked Ron as our Project Manager, he was consistent to provide his support and helping us to finish the project ahead of the deadline.  As the rule of thumb, everything was not smooth and easy as we were looking for during our remodeling kitchen, there were few obstacles that impacted the progress and may delay the schedule; but Ron Admony was always available either by phone or by coming to contact us regarding of any issues that we encountered when the project started until finished.  He responded to our questions or concerns any time that we had in couple hours or personally came to help us to resolve the issues.  He also provided his inputs to help our decision on color, counter top, and/or anything that will help our remodeling kitchen looks prettier.  His goal is always to make sure his customer satisfaction and happy.  It's really a learning lesson to remodel the kitchen and we're glad that we picked Treeium with Ron Admony as our project manager to work on our project.  The final reward was our beautiful kitchen and our family really enjoyed.  Thanks Ron Admony for great job well done and we're sure to contact you for our next project.  Treeium could be the contractor if you need to pick for any home improvement projects and special Ron Admony will be your Project Manger."
5,"Even if you know what you are doing, any kind of home improvement is potentially very scary.  There are so many things that can go wrong, or unexpected problems that can arise.  So, it has been my experience, to hire a contractor that is a professional & knows what he is doing.  
I am very comfortable & confident in recommending Guy Barnea & Treeium for your home improvement project.
I don't write a lot of reviews, and most are when something goes wrong !!
But in this case, I recognize how important to find a qualified person/company to do contracting work....and want to share with everyone my very positive experience.
His prices are very competitive....(not the cheapest)....but the cheapest price normally gets you the cheapest work....which usually makes it ultimately not the cheapest. And why would you not want the best quality work possible.
Guy's attention to detail, only made me extremely comfortable & confident about my expectations. Everyone from his laborers to supervisors accomplished everything I had asked for and Guy's output only made the ""hurdles"" minimal and made me a very satisfied customer.  
I think the best thing I can say....is if (and when) I have another remodeling project....I now need to make one phone call......which makes this process even better.
Great Work Guy & Treeium............I couldn't be happier !!"
5,"I had my master bathroom done and they did a great job. They are professional and on time with the schedule. They even worked extra hours 
to complete the project. I highly recommended this company"
4,"Great job Treeium! Good customer service Guy Borenstein & Sal. Quality workmanship. Your guys were willing to go the extra mile to make our experience less stressful. They clean up at the end of the day, put furniture back if they had to move them... The project was done 1 week later than scheduled otherwise you would have gotten 5 stars."
5,"We decided to remodel our outdated kitchen and found Treeium on a home improvement website.  After making an appointment Guy Breuer,the project manager,came to discuss our needs and gave us an estimate.  The project entailed a full gut of the kitchen which went very smoothly with a minimal amount of dirt and dust.  Rene, the foreman, and his crew did a very good job of being on time and finishing the project in a reasonable 3.1/2 weeks.  All through the renovation Guy was available to help with the choosing of finishes and design choices.  Though any renovation is stressful the crew from Treeium made the experience a little less so.  We would definitely recommend Treeium."
3,I am in the middle of the project.  Guy Borenstein has been my contact and very helpful and cooperative in the planning process.
5,They replaced the my 24 year old roof that was leaking. With the materials they  use and the cost I am set for next 30 years.
5,"They not only got my kitchen done by Christmas, Kobi and his team were amazing. I will definitely use them again and strongly recommend Treeium."
5,"We just recently completed our first bathroom remodel.  We had received multiple job estimates but chose Treeium because of the excellent presentation by Kobi (who would be the assigned project manager).  He listened to our needs and wishes and gave us clear and concise planning projections.  They met all of the goals and we are so pleased with the outcome.  In fact, we were so pleased that we had them do a complete house re-wire and interior paint job.  The work crews were all extremely professional and took great efforts to accommodate, advise and complete the work within the promised timelines.  The different disciplines were knowledgable with their respective field of expertse.  Kobi visited the site often and ensured excellent communication between the crews.  In one instance there was a minor glitch with an electrical outlet.  Within one hour of our call the PM had an electician out to check it out.  All around outstanding service.  Would use this company again."
5,"Treeium is the BEST!!  We worked with Meir Barzilai and right from the beginning, he was extremely professional, always on time and courteous.  Our project was completed on time and within our budget.  We will always use Treeium for any future projects.  Work with Meir...you won't be disappointed!!"
1,I have been very dissatisfied and frustrated so far with my experience with Treeium. Work started and there were immediately issues after demolition and it took two days to get someone to come out and take a look. Communication has been very poor and they haven't communicated a project plan. I continually have to ask when/if someone is going to come out instead of being kept in the loop. I keep taking time off from work and no one shows up.
5,"I LOVE Trrium.  I built a brand new 3,000 Sq. Foot Luxury Home in Malibu and they installation of Tiles/marble/granite was flawless.  Not a single complaint.  Meir Barzilai and his team are professional, trustworthy and courteous.  The job was completed on time and within our budget.  Meir was at our home daily to oversee and make sure the job was proceeding to his quality and standards.  Extremely hands-on and very focused team with tons of experience, i would highly recommend to anybody!!!"
5,"We recently had our new Laguna Woods home renovated by Treeium.  After an initial rocky start with a person no longer with the company, owner Moty Ginsburg had Ron Admony take over as our Project Manager and he has been excellent to work with, diligent in keeping our project on track and has been completely honest with us in all our dealings. 
 
The project is completed and we are very happy with the results.   We had Treeium add a walk-in shower in one bathroom and make the second into an on-suite master bath.  In addition, they created a laundry closet and opened up the kitchen to allow for a large refrigerator with custom cabinets.  To accomplish this they needed to demolish walls, borrow into the slab for new drainage, create two new walk-in showers and a new master closet.  They installed a beautiful glass bowl vanity and custom linen closet in the master bathroom with glass tiles in the shower and along the back of the vanity.  With Ron at the helm and a very able crew, including Luis, Arturo, Juan and Alex, they were able to get the project to a stage where we could move in on time and then they completed the last stages of the project without delay.  We have received many compliments on how the project turned out and everyone who sees it agrees that Treeium did a great job.  I am attaching photos so you can see the results, however, they do not do it justice.  

We highly recommend Ron Admony and Treeium to do your next project.  Not only will they handle your project with professionalism, they understand how important this is to you and treat you and your property with respect."
5,"Treeium is the best company in la and probably in California !

5,"We hired Treeium to remodel our home which included a completely gutted kitchen, all new electrical rewire, removal of acoustic ceilings, new Travis stone fireplace, refinished hardwood floors,  paint of all walls and a tankless water heater. Itay  guided the process from beginning to end with care and concern that we would be completely satisfied with the job done by each of the contractors. Our dreams of  a small Mediterranean villa were surpassed with the outcome of our beautiful home. We are 150 per cent happy with the work performed by our contractors who were here every single day and the fantastic service from Itay. Our kitchen is going to be the envy of everyone that visits our home. Thank you for making our dreams a reality. Rose and Joe Garcia"
5,"Guy came ready to make our family feel like we don't need any further consultations! 
He was:
Friendly- Called ahead to let us know he was on his way.
Great communicator- IMPORTANT! Listens to every idea and executes it.
Enthusiastic-Really excited to get the job.
Professional-Came with his Badge around his neck w/ ID and License.
Artistic- Visualized something we would have never considered.

So I had researched many different companies to get an estimate on the remodeling process at my mothers home. Going through of course Houzz, HGTV, magazines, remodeling guides, internet, and local ads, Guy made us look no further. 

My family got larger within the year with the birth of our 1 year old son and paying $1,650 for a leased home without utilities, car payments, insurances and daily expenses. We decided to make some changes. To minimize our costs. We plan to remodel the home to make it two private family areas.
My Mother owns a home in a prime location in Atwater Village and it currently has 7 bedrooms, 4 restrooms, 2 kitchens, 1 laundry area, 2 large living rooms and dining rooms and a large front yard and back yard. Not to mention also the garage.  

I had numerous consultations about building UP and making it it a two story home. 
Until, Guy! Once he looked at the place he was so inspired that he actually got me excited after being disappointed with high quotes and bad communication of what we are trying to achieve.
He said the house has a large enough in square footage and that we do NOT need to build up. Mind you; building up you are looking at more time, Money and hard to get permits. (Almost a $2-300,000.00 job which I still have all the past contractors calling and harassing me.) He said that the house is large enough to accommodate two different families with their own private area, entrance etc.. 
He said that it was just not designed right,; It looks like a maze. All we really had to do is rearrange all aspects of the house with a good floor plan, knock down walls, and since pluming is underground  with crawl space that would be the fastest, easiest, and inexpensive solution. HE MADE MY DAY!

Out of so many consultations NOBODY gave me that option. I knew then he wasn't there to just get a job and take my money. 
Anyways he came through a few days later with his virtual 3D designer and she measured the whole house and told me that she will design a likable, livable layout and email it to me with the draft including my furniture. All I had to do is send her photos of my current furniture to incorporate them in the visual display. How awesome. I can edit and change everything to our liking. I am just so excited on the actual construction which I can not review about since we are not there yet. 
So far, So good, But I will definitely update my thoughts throughout the process."
5,"My review is way overdue, it was around this time last year  that I hired Kobi who is one of the greatest project managers I've ever dealt with. I had a fantastic experience with the entire team of Treeium. Today I'm visiting their office to review my electricity bill with them to install solar panels on my house.  Their office is just beautiful; the staff is just amazing and super friendly. It was very nice to actually put a face behind the voice. I would personally like to thank Elizabeth for helping me finance my project at great rates which I can afforded. 

My first project was a kitchen remodel that Kobi, he met all of my expectations and more. He made my dream kitchen a reality.  The cleanup crew was fantastic. I never had to worry about picking up after the contractors when they were finished for the day. 

I have recommended Treeium and Kobi to my friend which hired them as well and is super happy with her project as well. I'm looking forward to installing my solar panels on my house."
5,"I was looking for a company to do my master and main bathroom renovations, but wanted to start out with a smaller project first - stairwell, ceiling refinishing, and painting - to see how well the company managed the project.  I was initially interested in Treeium because I liked the idea that their company was doing their part to be a little more green.  

From the very first meeting with my project manager through to the end of the project, I felt I had all the information about what they could do with my project and how they would go about meeting my ideas.

When we ran into an unexpected structural problem that required additional work before we could move on, my project manager was able to quickly adjust the contract and all the work was still entirely completed on schedule.

Having used a number of different contractors for other big projects in my home, I appreciated most that they took care of the 'little things' to make the whole project look complete.  They removed some fixtures to work through the whole space instead of taking the short cut of just working around the fixtures. They caulked the gaps left from previous work so that it would blend in perfectly with their work.  And, they did some extra finishing on a couple of the walls so that the painting would look even more precise.

I was very pleased with the work Treeium did and the ease of working with them, and am planning my bathroom renovations with them now."
5,"We selected Horizon Construction & Remodeling for our 1954 raised floor home’s main bathroom. We had new electric, plumbing, and more to support a modern bidet toilet, deep soak tub, tile work, custom cabinet, as well as faucets and fixtures in an older and smaller style home. David planed and scheduled the work on time and to costs, which passed all city inspections. Any questions, discrepancies, and requests as our bathroom walls and floors were opened, items installed, or final finish and refinements were promptly addressed to satisfaction. Enna Eskin also followed through on all administrative matters and various communications as the project progressed. A special thanks to the electricians and tile workers that were very professional, educational, skilled, and made value added recommendations for our decision-making. Thanks Horizon Construction !"
5,"This is our second remodel with Horizon construction & remodeling
We remodeled another bathroom last year with them
David our project manager was really good and helpful as always 

If we have anything else to remodel we will definitely call them !"
5,Horizon construction & remodeling did a fabulous job on my bathroom. The work was above excellent. Workers were timely thoughtful  and professional. I would recommend  Horizon to anyone.
5,"I recently remodeled my house and was sorely disappointed.  I was a bit gun shy to try again, but changed my mind after being stuck ay home during the covid lockdown. 


I decided to find a new contractor, and was lucky enough to find Mark Besnos, the owner of Horizon Construction and Remodeling.


Mark was able to make my vision a  reality, which was no small task.  He worked with my designer, Misti Riedel and I and had the patience of a saint.  This time around, it was an enjoyable experience.  


I wake up every morning and walk out into the main living area with a big smile on my face.  Before Mark remodeled, my place was so drab.  

I truly love my house and thank everyone for helping me."
5,"We selected Horizon Construction & remodeling in Fullerton because of their high rated reviews and we felt very comfortable with David Eskin the project manager. we thought he will be a good match since we will need to communicate with him on daily basis for the entire length of our remodel. He helped us design our new kitchen and bathroom and select materials while keeping up to code.
we wanted to achieve clean and simple look, more space on our counters along with timeless design. 
The results exceeded our expectations. We love it!"
5,"This my experience with Horizon Construction and Remodeling,
and why I recommend them.
This is the second time that I have hired a contractor. The first time was a bathroom remodel, and it was a disaster, so I was very apprehensive about hiring another contractor.  We needed to remodel our kitchen, so I had no choice. I did my due diligence and research and called three companies to interview. All three I had no prior knowledge of or experience with. Out of the three bids, there was a high, a medium, and a low.
After talking to them one more time I went with the medium bid company. That company is called Horizon Construction and Remodeling. It turns out I made the right choice. My experience with this company is the complete opposite from my first experience with a contractor. 
My Project Manager was Mark, who did an outstanding job of keeping the project moving quickly efficiently. His crews showed up on time, were professional and did quality work, from plumbing to electrical to framing to painting to cabinets all were done to my satisfaction. If something was not done to my satisfaction (which was rare), I just let Mark know about it and he would send someone to either redo or touch-up the work. Mark would visit the job site frequently.
I feel Mark is honest and has his customer’s best interest at heart. There were a couple of times when he could have charged me extra money for items that came up during the project, but he did not. 
Like any project we had to make some changes along the way, and Mark is very willing to work with you to make sure that you get what you want. Mark will listen to your ideas plus he has many ideas himself. He helped us a lot with our kitchen design.
They started my project Oct. 11, 2001. My wife and I were hoping to have the project done by Christmas. They had it done in 7 weeks in time for Thanksgiving!
The inside staff is led be Enna. They make sure everything is ordered on time. They even arrange for inspections. They are very polite and efficient and responsive.
We are doing our doors and windows next and we going to have Horizon Construction and Design do the work.
I recommend Horizon Construction and Design; I give them a strong 10.

Mark and Diane Kincheloe   
Fountain Valley, CA."
5,"Horizon Construction & Remodeling, did everything they promised. Their man did quality work. They said “it will be done” and it was done as they said.
Our Kitchen & bathroom remodel turned better than we thought. 
Mark helped with the design and selecting all the materials and that was very helpful. 
We would recommend them to anyone."
5,I completely renovation my 1 bedroom condo in the City of Fullerton.  Everything was removed from flooring walls kitchen bathroom  walk in  closet. The outcome was outstanding. I couldn't believe how great everyting. Turnedd out.. Every time I come home it's like walking into a model home.. I enjoy Everything and my favorite place is kitchen and patio BBQing and watching sports on my new patio TV.
5,"It was a pleasure working with Horizon Construction and Remodeling, on the complete renovation of my kitchen. David and Enna were extremely knowledgable and professional.  The crew were also very polite, friendly and considerate in the care of cleaning up the worksite everyday, and making sure I was happy with the work done each day.  I will definitely use Horizon on my next project, and highly recommend them.  Thank you to everyone who made our dream kitchen possible.
 
Jeanne and Gary Poggensee"
5,"We recently just finished a remodel of two bathrooms using Horizon for the project. They were easy to work with and worked hard to accommodate a house with four people working from home. Working with their design team, installers, and trades people, the entire project came together without issue. They even helped us by doing some things out of order to ease the burden of a family of four using just one working bathroom.  But the real payoff was in the end product. For that a picture is worth a 1000 words. We are so pleased with our new bathrooms! Thank you to the team at Horizon!"
5,"Such a pleasure to work with Mark and the entire staff at Horizon Construction. Not only did they remodel our entire house filled with furniture during a pandemic, but we did the whole process from out of town. Mark and his staff kept us constantly up to date via Zoom, phone calls, and loads of texts and emails. And the best part is the house turned out better than expected! They made sure the work was done exactly the way we planned and to our expectations, which included guaranteeing anything that went wrong. Mark was a big help in the design process which included helpful advise on where we should spend money and where we could cut corners. He also had little things done along the way, some that he didn't charge us for but that were necessary to make the house look more finished. Lastly, they took great care in making sure the furniture and home decor were protected and covered during the whole process, and whatever was moved was put back where they found it.  We are so grateful for the hard work, service, and patience that went into making our house look beautifully updated!"
5,"So happy to have gone with Horizon Construction for our major kitchen, and 2 bath, remodel project.! From the first meeting with Mark, the owner, I felt that he was trustworthy, knowledgeable and fair. He, and the Horizon Construction crews, did not disappoint. Communication with Mark, Enna, and the office staff were admirable. Mark's design expertise was very helpful. He met all of our wants & needs. Our kitchen was taken from a poorly designed eyesore to a beautiful space. We had major structural work, removal of load bearing beams and steel moment frame, installing three steel beams at the ceiling to create an open floor plan. We completely changed the footprint of the kitchen. Custom cabinets turned out beautifully! The materials purchased through Horizon Design were of high quality and sourced in a timely manner. Workers were friendly, arrived on time and cleaned up at the end of each day. We were so pleased with the kitchen that we added on two bath remodels which were completed along with the kitchen. Thank you Horizon for delivering a quality space which we are happy to invite our friends & family to. We will enjoy the beautiful kitchen & bathrooms for many years to come!"
5,"Horizon construction & Remodeling remodeled/updated both my master and the main bathrooms, which were in their original mid-60s construction state.  David Eskin and his team of tradesmen helped bring my vision to fruition.  As with any project, once the walls were opened up, some revisions were required; based upon their expertise and experience, Horizon was able to provide a few suggestions and a few “tweaks” to address these revisions.  I couldn’t be happier with the results! Both bathrooms are much more functional and beautiful!
Horizon also did some minor improvements in my laundry area – again improving the functionality and looks!
Note: Remodeling costs did not cover much of the material costs.  I had already selected and/or purchased some of the building materials; I did research and purchase much of the remaining materials (tub, vanities, tiles). Horizon does have its own showroom, and could have provided these at an additional cost.  However, because I already had a firm idea as to what I wanted, I handled the ordering of these myself."
5,"Our kitchen was remodeled by Mark Besnos and Enna at Horizon Construction and Remodeling. We chose them after seeing all the great reviews on the Houzz app. When we walked into their showroom, we were warmly greeted by Diana who made us feel very comfortable.  Their product display made it easy for us to put our ideas together. Mark’s crew did a wonderful job.  Kudos to his crew, they really worked hard. Joel Chavez was a standout carpenter/jack of all trades doing much of the major work and tying together any imperfections and any loose ends that arose with a great attitude, expertise, and skill. He’s quite an asset to Horizon.  Antonio Garcia who did our fabulous backsplash and Tom Tzur was the electrician.  Mark ensured that each phase of the project was done correctly and completed on time (about 8 weeks). We gutted and replaced our 80’s kitchen (10’ by 10’) including the small dining area. We kept the same layout but switched the positions of the sink, stove and refrigerator.  Enna helped with all the communication and paperwork and scheduling of the inspections, payments etc.  Thanks to Mark, Enna, and their crew, we have a beautiful modern kitchen with two toned white and blue cabinets.  
Lessons Learned:
1.Stick to your budget and have extra funds for unforeseen things because for sure there will always be something that will come up.  Understand what is and is not included in your contract.  Don’t just assume that everything is included.
2.Be flexible with your time. There is a general outline of what jobs will be done in order mostly during the weekdays but things may change with short notice.  
3.Check that your materials/colors are in stock before you sign your contract. Due to the Covid and political environment, some materials may take longer to get or not at all.  Some newer colors may cost more.
4.Look at your cabinet colors in every light.  We first looked at an espresso-colored cabinet that looked like black in shade and looked light cherry colored under the full sun. 
5.Know what crown molding you want for the top of your cabinets…having pictures will help.
6.Ask Mark if you are not sure of any detail or work that has to be done. Do not wing it…else any fixes may cost you extra. 
7.For lighting such as chandeliers, measure everything. Use you tube to learn to measure your lighting fixtures.
8.Certain changes such as electrical, structural will require city permits and inspections.  Your city’s inspector’s availability will cause delays up to one week. 
9.Choose your grout color for the backsplash…apparently there’s a ton of them (we were looking at different shades of grey because white is too hard to clean). 
10.Choose your door and doorknobs ahead of time. Check to make sure it works including deadbolt after it’s been installed.
11.Choose your baseboard style and size.
12.Choose your light dimmers switches."
5,"After shopping several companies, we chose Horizon Construction and Remodeling for our home improvement project, which was to enlarge and update our kitchen and main bathroom.  In addition, we converted all of our flooring to vinyl.
We are extremely happy with the service, responsiveness, dependability, and the results Horizon provided.  David Eskin was our project manager.  David became a consultant and friend during the process.  He proved to be patient and honest when we encountered an issue with the granite installation for our kitchen.  We upgraded our material to a beautiful and unique Brazilian granite for our kitchen counter.  Our initial granite slab cracked 3 feet across the width of the counter 2 days after installation.  David and his crew reviewed the issue and, without hesitation or argument, removed the cracked granite and replaced it with a new slab at their cost.  Although this experience was extremely stressful for all, the integrity displayed by David and Horizon was stellar and unique in the construction industry.  Contractors are easy to find, but an honest and dependable one is rare in our opinion.  On this experience alone, we would recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling without reservation.  They made it right.
All construction is stressful and we lived in our house during the remodel.  This project was our first in this home, but our fourth major reconstruction in our 45 years of marriage.  Horizon was by far the best remodel experience!"
5,"We were referred to Horizon Construction and Remodeling from my sister's coworker at Houzz for a full kitchen remodel. Our consultation went wonderfully and we felt very comfortable with David. He did a great job explaining their company and the process for our kitchen remodel. He was able to take all of our ideas for the kitchen and make them a reality. He was honest and helpful throughout the whole process and we did not have to stress about all the things you hear other people having to go through during a remodel. He was quick to respond to any emails, calls or texts. The only thing I wish we would have received without asking for was a weekly schedule on what was happening each day and who we would be expecting at the house and what time so we could plan ahead as full time working parents. Overall we were very happy with every contractor who worked on the kitchen! We do not have one complaint about any of the people that came into our house throughout the remodel. We would highly recommend Horizon to our families and friends for any future remodeling and would us them again in the future. We feel that we now have our dream kitchen thanks to the team at Horizon Construction and Remodeling."
5,"We had a fairly large, relatively unused laundry room and a guest bedroom without an attached guest bathroom.  After hunting for a contractor I met Michael who was really friendly, had a clear cut understanding of what I was looking to do without much back and forth, and gave me a break down quote for each aspect of the project in a fast and timely fashion. We converted our downstairs bedroom into a mini master suite with an attached bathroom, French doors where a window once was, and sound proofing of the walls to prevent noise from our flat screen in the family room that shares a wall. We then made a smaller laundry nook. Albeit a few scheduling communication errors, everything was done with care and what I really liked was how Michael would come and look at things and notice stuff that I didn't even see and get them fixed and or corrected on his routine walk throughs. Additionally, the workers that would come to the house never made me feel uncomfortable or worried."
5,"We recently remodeled our Master bathroom and chose Horizon Construction & Remodeling in Fullerton to do the job.  Overall, we had a great experience! We were given a fair price for our remodel and the quality of work was excellent.  Everyone we worked with was polite, courteous and professional.  Any minor issues that came up were addressed promptly and correctly.  Our bathroom looks a million times better is a lot more functional.  Bravo to David, our General Contractor, and his crew!  We would definitely recommend Horizon Construction & Remodeling to anyone and we plan to use them again for our next remodeling project.

5,"When you realize you need work done by a contractor, a lot of apprehension may go through your mind.  But those fears and doubts will be washed away if you choose to work with Horizon Construction & Remodeling in Fullerton, CA 92832.   We dealt mostly with David and from our first meeting we had a good feeling about working with him and Horizon.   David really listened to our ideas and gave us a few of his own which we never would have thought about.   While we wanted to do a few small projects as well (painting all rooms in our house with new flooring, lighting and baseboards), our “big” decision was to remodel our kitchen.    This was a complete gut down to the bare bones of the room then build it back up.  Throughout the entire process David made frequent visits to check on progress, answer questions, and if something needed to be looked into, he was on it right away.  His team always came as scheduled, and we were always looped in every step of the way.   David’s timeline for completion was right on target as well.   It helps that we too were always ready with whatever we needed to provide such as ordering and delivery of our new kitchen appliances, picking lighting fixtures and paint colors and coming to the show room to pick out our flooring, cabinetry, countertops and back splash.  And by the way, their showroom has a large array of options to choose from.  We even had a few last-minute thoughts of having the facing of our fireplace redone and adding some extra lighting in the home to which David accommodated easily.  Even with a few snags due to Covid 19 whereas the countertop and backsplash we picked (which had been on order for months) was suddenly unavailable, his team was on it and helped us pick back up options, to which we found we loved more than our original choices.   In the office, we also worked at times with Maria and Enna, both of whom were pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful to us.    David’s team was courteous and respectful and followed safety protocols like wearing masks.   Since we worked from home, it was easy to practice distancing since we were all in different rooms.  And if the workers needed to speak to us, everyone wore masks and stood apart out of courtesy.    We were overwhelmed with how beautiful the kitchen turned out and were just as pleased with how refreshed and updated our whole interior looks now.   We would highly recommend working with the team at Horizon because this experience helped us rest those apprehensions I spoke of in the beginning.   And we achieved what we wanted in that now when you walk in our kitchen, you just say “WOW.”  Thank you."
4,"We had our completely remodeled, removed a load-bearing wall to open up the kitchen to the den. We also did a full remodel on our small master bathroom to create a big master bath with a small walk-in closet which we did not have before. Also our laundry room was moved to the hallway along with some change orders along the way. We are very happy with the end result and we are enjoying our new home."
5,"Excellent results! What was once a dirty, moldy, ugly bathroom now looks like a spa bathroom in a Vegas hotel; I’m still amazed at the transformation even now that it’s been operational for a while. 

David was very responsive to texts, and always followed up to be sure things were going well, and even when I wanted a big, heavy mirrored medicine cabinet against his recommendation, he graciously had the backsplash tiles adjusted so the back wall could be rewired, then hung the mirror and now it looks great. At least I think it does.

I wanted a particular finish on the cabinets, but he advised to go much darker, which was counter(get it?)intuitive to me, but he was absolutely right, and the dark cabinets contrast perfectly with the earth-tones and creams throughout the rest of the bathroom; I’m glad for his recommendation as it maintains the warm design while providing an elegant touch. 

I can be a difficult client, but David was gracious throughout, and his subcontractors all did a great job and were very pleasant. I also appreciate that while it wasn’t the biggest project, just a smallish bathroom, he gave it his all and treated it like a project of any size; I was actually rejected by a couple of contractors because the project wasn’t ‘big enough’ but David and Horizon gave it their all. I can’t be happier with the end result - the transformation is nothing short of remarkable."
5,"David Eskin with Horizon Construction and Remodeling did a great job coordinating the remodel. All the trades did an excellent job. Any issues were responded to and fixed immediately. We are very happy with the finished product, and will use them again in the future."
5,"We are happy to see the remodeling is completed.  I am satisfied with the materials chosen and the suggestions made throughout the process.  Alicia and Mark Besnos collaborated in choosing the design materials.  We look forward to many years of our new bathrooms.   
Thank you Horizon Construction & Remodeling for the remodels.

Brian and Alicia Dolan"
5,"I had an excellent experience with David from Horizon Construction on an exterior project recently completely and would recommend them highly for any project internal or external.

David was extremely professional throughout the entire process.  From the initial call and consultation we tossed ideas back and forth, his vision was exactly what I was looking for.  He promptly sent images of ideas and websites for me to review and even though we didn't exactly meet at times he was flexible to accept my idea and in the end we came up with something I am very proud of!    To be honest...there where issues, but not with him!   He came through and directed his team to fix not only things I found, but even things that did not fit his image of perfection....he never flinched, his quality was excellent and did not let his team fall behind!   Again, I am extremely happy with the service, vision and final product and would recommend them anytime you have a project you want perfection."
5,"Having chosen Horizon Construction & Remodeling for our project was the best decision we could have made.  The Project Manager, Eitan Beznos made sure that we were completely satisfied 

every step of the way making sure that all of our concerns were addressed.  He was very pleasant and easy to communicate with.  The completed job looks amazing, we could not be 

more satisfied and, we get many compliments from strangers that walk or drive by.  A big kudos to all those involved in the project and we will most definitely recommend Horizon to 

our friends, neighbors and family.

5,"The upstairs bath had been partially remodeled prior to purchasing my condo 5 years ago. It had an updated vanity and lavatory, but the tub and shower combination were the original fiberglass builder-grade enclosure and definitely showed its age of 30 plus years. I wanted this bathroom to look as good as the rest of my home with a new tub, new tile, and new flooring.
Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc. expertly gave me exactly the bath I desired. Horizon’s showroom had ample samples of tiles and I was easily able to select the bath/shower wall tile and flooring that unified my vision. I did not have to wait long for the job to commence and all work was done as quickly as I could have hoped. The only delays were due to unavoidable waiting for inspections and a holiday that delayed one inspection. For those tasks that did not require an inspection to proceed, the trade contractor would show up the following morning. I was able to have my walls retextured and painted, a new overhead light added above the bath/shower, replace the medicine cabinet, and a new exhaust fan and all fixtures installed for the completed beautifully finished bathroom.
My project manager David Eskin coordinated each trade and supplies wonderfully. All of the contractors selected for my project were very professional and I appreciate how quickly and well each performed their trade work. I am delighted with workmanship and the end results."
4,"We had a kitchen and powder room remodel Aug- Oct 2020. We love the final product! It is pretty much exactly what We envisioned. The project finished in a timely manner, and his guys did a phenomenal job; especially tile (Fernando) and cabinets (sorry I don’t remember everyone’s name). Mark was knowledgeable and answered our questions promptly. He was good at showing up frequently and reviewing all the work. 

My only suggestion for improvement would be giving a more accurate estimate, and notifying the owners of the cost of any changes prior to the work being done. The project ended up quite a bit more than anticipated. However, we are happy with the result, and would recommend Horizon to others."
5,"We had our kitchen entirely re-done by Horizon Construction & Remodeling. Horizon replaced our cabinets, sink, inserted a backsplash, rewired our receptacles to meet current code and repainted the walls. They also installed recessed lighting under the cabinets which really brings out the ambiance of the kitchen overall. It was a complex operation and they project-managed it flawlessly. They took a lot of time to truly understand what we wanted and then provided examples and expertise to help guide us to our final decisions. We could not recommend them more for anyone looking to remodel their kitchen."
5,"On behalf of my husband and myself, we highly recommend Horizon Construction for your home projects. This recommendation letter is long overdue. We hired Horizon Construction Inc. in the summer of 2019 to gut and remodel a master bedroom bath and install a sliding glass door. Michael the construction manager was very transparent with us about the timeline and the steps and costs. Everything was done exactly as he said.

To begin with the contract manager Michael was an utmost professional. We told him what we wanted and he gave us a reasonable estimate that closely matched our own estimated costs. As recommended before committing to hiring a contractor we requested 2 other estimates, one came in ridiculously higher than Horizon and one quite a bit lower than Horizon, but we went with Horizon because of Michael’s evident knowledge and on spot recommendations. The meeting with the other contractors didn’t leave my husband or I with the same confidence in amount of knowledge of process and esthetic know how. In the long run Michael’s trained eye for function and aesthetic helped us come up with a design that we are extremely happy with.

Their entire crew was extremely knowledgeable and efficient. We were extremely pleased with their attention to detail and craftsmanship."
5,"We did our master bath remodeling this year and we chose Horizon construction for the second time. Mark the owner, as usual, came up with the perfect design for our relatively small space. The design let us include a big shower, closed bathroom area and lots of closets. Something I did not think we could accomplished at first.
The construction went fast considering the City closure for Covid19. They did a fantastic job and kept everything clean during the construction.
We now have a very beautiful Master Bath we enjoy every day. I recommend Horizon Construction for any remodeling you need. They are very good at what they do"
5,"Professional work done by professional workers in a professional way. We highly recommend Horizon for any home improvement or repair that you might do. Last year Horizon repaired the stucco, wood trim and painted our house. The paint started to peel on part of the trim and they promptly repaired it at no charge. We are also happy with the patio cover they did for us last year.   Steve an Toni G"
5,"Our wrought iron fence was on its last leg, already rotted through.  We wanted a short block wall topped by a vinyl fence. I found Horizon Construction on a couple of the “help” websites and called them. Eitan Beznos came out, discussed the job and provided an estimate. We came to an agreement and they started the next week. The block wall went fast, they finished the 2’ H x 60’ L wall in one day. It is on top of a steep 60’ tall hill.  The job was completed in a timely manner.  All along, Eitan kept me aware of progress and status.  He came out to inspect the job. At the end, Eitan and the company owner/manager came out and inspected the job to make sure we were satisfied.  We could not have been anymore satisfied with the work, the timeliness, and the cleanup efforts. Horizon finished the job on the originally forecast completion date.  I would recommend Horizon and Eitan Beznos for any construction or re-modeling efforts you might have.

5,"We got bids from 5 different contractors for the construction we needed in our backyard. We were converting our garage into an additional dwelling unit (ADU), which has very specific requirements in most cities. David Eskin came out from Horizon; they were the last bid we received. All the bids came in just about the same ballpark, but we chose Horizon because David seemed very upfront and personable at our first meeting. He took the time to address our questions and concerns; all of them, even if we didn’t particularly want to hear the answers. We trusted him. We live in a historical home, so there were many rules we needed to follow and styles we needed to match exactly. David, his crew and Horizon did that perfectly. We ran into some problems because our house is old. They couldn’t have been foreseen because nobody knew what was under our garage. Those problems were frustrating and added expense to our project, but David and Enna at the office helped us through those as well. The interior turned out so much better than we imagined it would! It’s just beautiful. We would recommend Horizon to anyone needing to get any work done in or around their home. Awesome company!!"
5,"Eitan Beznos of Horizon Construction did a major Remodeling on my kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms and garage. This included:
New patio slab.
Removal of wall and load bearing 4x4's.
Kitchen island.
Fireplace.
New roof.
New ceiling.
Complete rewire of house and garage. 
Power panel upgrade and electric car charger in garage.
Paint interior and exterior.

Eitan was the project manager. He was easy to work with and there was good communication with Eitan and the office staff. The process was clearly written down and all questions were answered.

I did not know exactly what I wanted and Eitan made useful suggestions. He designed the layouts and helped me select materials for the floor, ceiling, kitchen counters and bathrooms.

Eitan pulled permits and all of the inspections were passed.
There were often several teams of workers in the house at the same time. Eitan coordinated the work to insure that the progress was efficient and that different groups did not get into each others way.

When problems came up Eitan dealt with them. Termite damage was discovered and had to be addressed before a bathroom could be completed.
Building codes required that work had to stop when old flooring was removed by a hazmat company.

While I thought that the quotes were high, what I got were clear goals, quality of work, management of workers, problem resolving and the overall progress of the project.

I was very satisfied with the end result. The open floor plan between kitchen and family room and the removal of cupboards in the hallway, makes the house look very expansive. The transformation was stunning.

I would recommend Eitan for home remodeling.

5,"we recently had our master bath shower remodeled by Horizon Construction. we wanted a universal design to accommodate his and her showers with a bench , rain shower, 2 hand held showers, and grab bars. it is a very professional job and finished on time. david and the entire crew were fantastic to work with. we are pleased with the functionality and look. we had interviewed several different contractors but Horizon was the only one that saw our vision and made it happen. i highly recommend Horizon Construction for any remodel project. susan joyce"
5,"I had the bathtub removed from the master bath and a shower with a steam unit installed. David Eskin was the project manager and was a pleasure to work with. Despite the current pandemic situation, David kept the project going. The workers were amazing, each one an expert in their respective craft. The job was finished beautifully and I’m very happy with the results. I would highly recommend Horizon Construction for any remodeling job."
5,"If you're shopping contractors, and want to avoid a nightmare, read this. Licensed contractors are not all the same. Horizon Construction & Remodeling gets 5 stars. This company delivered what was promised. I'm not affiliated with Horizon in any capacity. I'm a customer, who hired them to remodel my bathroom after calling 5 other contractors, who either didn't show up, or quoted ridiculous bids. Mark, who owns the company with his wife, Enna, gave me a quote that was right about middle range. He paid attention to my vision, and when I asked  his opinion, he had great ideas, but was never forceful. He was also right up front about everything—nothing hidden. After I decided to sign the contract, I was still somewhat skeptical. Bathrooms and kitchens are multi-phase projects, and things can go south quickly. I'd already heard all the nightmares about hiring the wrong contractor. By day 2, I noticed that Mark, also my project manager, stayed on top of every detail, so I stopped stressing. All the crews he sent for each phase were skilled, knowledgable, and cleaned up afterwards. I got the impression this company only uses competent crews, who produce quality workmanship. No problems communicating, either. Mark was always available. Another thing: he's organized, and kept the project moving forward. The staff appeared to be organized, as well. I'm thrilled with the appearance and function of my new bathroom—it's gorgeous. It turned out much better than I had expected.  If I have another remodel project in the future, I won't hesitate to hire them again. Thank you so much, Mark, Enna, Grace, Anna, Maria and staff!"
4,"We had a great experience with David Eskin on the remodel of our kitchen and floors in 2019. Work was completed on time and his workers were outstanding.  Four months after completion there was a problem with the grout cracking along the kitchen counter and David promptly sent his tile guy out to re-do the cracking grout.  Now, four months later, the problem occurred again. David promptly responded again and this time they used a flexible material that matched the grout perfectly.  In my experience Horizon Construction stands by their work and has responded quickly to my concerns even after the project was completed."
5,"I hired Mark Besnos and Enna of Horizon Construction and Remodeling in the spring of 2019 to do a complete kitchen remodel which included removing a load bearing wall and removing a gas fireplace.  The actual construction began with the demolition in mid-July and the job was completed the last week of October. I had a great experience overall despite the usual stresses of a home remodeling project (and living in the house during construction). Mark listened to my ideas and concerns and he helped me bring the beach cottage home of my dreams to fruition. He was very knowledgeable and gave me great advice on every aspect of the project. Mark and Enna invited me to their showroom in Fullerton and showed me a wide variety of materials (flooring, tile, Quartz, cabinetry, etc.) to choose from.  I appreciated Mark’s attention to detail, thorough explanation of our contract, extensive resources, and consistent open communication. Mark was the project manager for my remodel and he was onsite regularly to oversee his crew. I always felt as though my project was Mark and Enna’s top priority. Any time I had a question or concern, Mark and/or Enna, promptly took my call or immediately called me back. Mark was committed to keeping the project on schedule as much as possible, even when unforeseen delays occurred due to materials being held up. He always had a plan B to keep things moving. All of his crew members were very reliable, courteous, and dedicated. Many of his crew members even came to my house on weekends. I am extremely happy with my new, improved, expansive kitchen, living, and dining room. I absolutely love it! A huge Thank You to Mark, Enna, the incredible office staff (Genesis and Vanessa) and to all of the skilled craftsmen at Horizon for creating a beautiful home for my family!"
5,"Horizon construction and Remodeling did a major kitchen remodel for us including removal of walls, fireplace, and reconstruct a large portion of our ceiling.  They literally transformed our kitchen!  
After checking out many others, we decided to choose Horizon Construction and Remodeling because of all the great reviews.  After meeting the staff, our project manager David Eskin and reading all the positive reviews we knew we made the right decision.  The staff is wonderful.  Very caring, respectful and honest.  Our kitchen turned out  beautiful.  We are very happy with the outcome!

Demolition was right on schedule and the crew was excellent, very fast and left the job neat at the end of the day. We did however encounter a set back which caused a long pause after demolition.  This lengthened the job quite a bit and added additional expense and inconvenience (we feel) could have been avoided with a more through inspection (pre-demo). 
All the staff at Horizon are great to work with.  David our project manager is terrific.  He is easy to work with and very helpful.  He provided suggestions that were very helpful and added to the beauty of our job.  There were times he could have lost his patience because of my indecisiveness but never once did!  He’s a true gentleman.
Caesar our cabinet maker is a master at his trade.  We love his work and are so pleased with our cabinets!
Something notable that you may not find in many other constructions companies.  With Horizon, once the project ends, they treat you with the same kindness as the day you signed the contract.  

This company shines in Customer satisfaction!"
5,"We recently had our 2500 square foot home remodeled by Horizon Construction & Remodel, which included the kitchen, master bath, flooring, lighting, paint, fireplaces, millwork, plumbing and tile.  We contacted a total of four general contractors, all of whom were within the same approximate price range, however, after meeting with Mike Roppo, we decided to sign a contract with Horizon and we’re glad we did!  Mike was our Project Manager and he did an excellent job overseeing and managing the entire project from start to finish.  He is professional, knowledgeable, personable and made sure that everything was done right!  He was quick to respond to phone calls, texts, and emails and came by to check the work often.  We are retired so we were able monitor the work as it was being completed.  At times issues would arise, but whenever we expressed a concern, Mike was prompt to resolve it, making sure that all work was done to our complete satisfaction and that no corners were cut.  All of the contractors that worked in our home were very experienced and good at what they did!  We were especially impressed with Hector who painted the entire inside of the house, and Victor who did all of the tile and marble work in the master bath, kitchen, and fireplaces.  Also Ulyses (plumbing), Hugo (flooring), Caesar (countertops), and Tomar (electrician), were all excellent at their crafts.   The process of remodeling our entire home took five months and everything turned our beautiful!  Horizon Construction & Remodel is an excellent company that stands behind their work and prides themselves in customer satisfaction!"
5,"All workmanship and workers were very professional and very nice. 

They always cleaned after their jobs. We are very happy with the way our bathroom turned out. 

Michaelangelo Roppo - our project manager was very helpful. He spend 2 days shopping with me, picking out everything was needed for the remodel. And I DO MEAN EVERYTHING. 

i really did appreciate his time snd expertise. 

The ladies in the office are very nice. 

Enna Eskin helped me match colors and styles for cabinets and counter tops in Horizon's showroom. 

I will recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling for any of your projects"
5,"Our goal was to remodel the kitchen, guest bathroom, and flooring of our home. This is the very first time my wife and I have ever took on a major remodel project. It was important to have a contractor that was honest , responsive, and did quality work within our budget. Since my wife and I work and are extremely busy with our kids, it was also important that we have project manager that would communicate with us and closely monitor the people working on our home regarding quality. We met with Eitan, project manager for Horizon Construction  and he took the time to understand that these qualities were important to us. He was also very honest about the project and did not overpromise just to earn our business. Eitan and his company made sure we knew they wanted to do what’s best for us and immediately we felt confident Horizon was fit for the job. His crews were very professional and would answer our questions and always cleaned up when they left for the day. Of course there were some hiccups during the project such as the fridge not fitting in the space and some kitchen cabinets needing to be moved around and adjusted. In the end, the things we requested got fixed and Eitan made sure we were happy. I would recommend Horizon to those that see the value of a project manager. Overall, the quality was good for our budget and I would rate Horizon a 4.7 out of 5."
5,"I has Horizon Construction & Remodeling out to do a bid to remodel a guest and master bathroom because of their high rating on Angie’s list.  An appointment was made and David Eskin showed up right on time.  He gave me a detailed bid right on the spot in writing.  Horizon did each bathroom separately so I could always have a usable shower.  I had already picked out most finishes before I got bids.  However, after the backsplash I had picked out was installed, I hated it.  David was great and said they would re-do it no problem with whatever alternative tile I picked.  There were some issues throughout the process that came up but I really appreciated that David and his subcontractors always came up with a solution.  The final products are beautiful.  Now I have 2 spa-like bathrooms with modern finishes that I’m thrilled to show off."
5,"We contracted Horizon Remodeling to remodel our fireplace and paint our kitchen, family room, living room and hallway.  Eitan Beznos managed the project and was extremely conscientious making sure all work was done correctly and completed as promised.  He met with us frequently to check progress and make sure work was done to our satisfaction.  When we asked for additional electrical work, he arranged for an excellent electrician named Tomer who did a fantastic job for us,
We would recommend Horizon Remodeling.  Work was well done and finished earlier than promised."
5,"Horizon completed a 450 square foot addition on our house that included moving an exterior wall and reworking the roof line to add a bathroom and expand three bedrooms.  This project took place from July 2019 to November 2019.  Our primary criteria for selecting a construction company was familiarity with working with our city, timeliness, and quality of work  performed.

We are very happy with the final product of this project.  The finished work provided by Horizon Construction is beautiful and works well within our high end home. The craftsmen used for the detail work were top notch, and the projects that needed to match existing finishes in the house look nearly flawless in their integration.  We did not have any problems with permitting the plans or with passing the inspections with the city so there were no hold ups time wise because of inspection issues.

When any hiccups did occur, as they occur in any remodel or home project, Horizon was very quick to correct them to the best of their ability or propose solutions that would result in the same high end product we were looking for.  The customer service provided was quite good.

David is a great project manager and was very attentive. He made sure any and all concerns were addressed promptly and that questions were answered in a very timely manner.  He was great about working with me in regards to our timeline and making the process of living through the project as painless as possible.

In short, I am quite happy that we chose Horizon Construction for our addition project and would absolutely recommend them."
5,"I decided to do a complete bathroom remodel, and after meeting with several contractors, I decided on Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc.. I am very happy with my overall experience. My bathrooms look absolutely beautiful. Horizon gutted both bathrooms and replaced everything with new white porcelain tile, sparkling mosaic panels and backsplash, sturdy glass doors, chrome trims, and all new fixtures. They painted both bathrooms light grey with white trims, and replaced the laminate floors with light grey toned tile. I love the results and I am glad I decided to do business with Horizon.

I also had a great experience with Horizon’s customer service. They provide excellent service. Everyone I spoke with (demolition crew, plumber, office staff, contractor, owner) was professional, competent, and courteous. Initially, I was in constant contact with contractor, David Eskin. He was punctual, knowledgeable, and professional. In the second half of the project, I was in constant contact with Enna. She was professional, knowledgeable, and very attentive to my requests. Whenever I had a question or concern, I could text her and she would respond within minutes. That was important to me and I appreciated the expediency. Based on my customer experience with Enna, I can say she cares a lot about the reputation of the company and delivering great customer satisfaction. The project is now complete, and thanks to Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc., I have two beautiful bathrooms."
5,"My wife and I have added a master bathroom and walk in closet, as well as adding a new linen closet and floors throughout the house with Horizon Construction. We are so happy with the outcome and how our project manager answered any questions we had along the way. We feel confident that if any issues pop up in the future that we can call and they will send someone out to correct. We have referred Horizon to our friends and will recommend them in the future as we are so happy with the outcome of our house."
5,"I contacted Houzz to search for a contractor to remodel our two small bathrooms.  I did not know where to start.  They put me in touch with Horizon and within a couple of days I was meeting with Eitan Beznos, their bathroom specialist. What impressed me most about Eitan was his friendliness and his desire to look after my every remodeling need. He was up front with the cost and the time it would take to complete both bathrooms. He recommended the best place to shop for tile and bathroom fixtures. He even took me shopping to look for vanities and helped me choose the size and design I was looking for.  Once the work was started the project crew became extended family, coming and going as needed. I was contacted almost daily by Eitan or Genesis Millan from the office to make sure I knew what was the plan for the day.  There were inspections at each stage of the project  and we still came in under the original time frame given.  I am so pleased with the  professionalism of the everyone who was a part of the remodel, the quality of the workmanship and the beauty of both bathrooms."
5,"We are very pleased with the way our fireplace wall looks .
Each phase of the project was done by workers who were skilled and experienced. 
They did their job quickly and always made sure the room was kept clean.
The project was unique and changes the appearance of the whole room. 
We would recommend David Eskin our project manager and Horizon Construction & Remodeling Inc to anyone thinking of Remodeling any room in their house"
5,"My wife, Kathy and I back in late July contacted three contractors to provide us an estimate to remodel our bathroom’s toilet and shower area.  Eitan Beznos provided us, what we felt was the estimate and help.  For this remodel, we were under somewhat of a time constraint to try and complete the project by 9/3.  
Eitan’s crew started demolition as promised on the day as promised.  Eitan had Ron, and George come in for the rough framing, electrical and plumbing, which was completed within the first week along with the Hot Mopping.  Ron and George and the hot mop person did an incredible job completing on schedule or even ahead of schedule.
The main impact to the remodel, was from the city inspection crew.  While we were delayed a week before we could tile the shower and the floor, Eitan and Ron had their tiling crew work the Labor Day Weekend to try and catch up, which again we were held up for city inspection. Further delaying completion.  George came in to perform the finish work, even coming in late in the day, I am sure after putting in a full day on another job.  The custom shower doors that have been installed are beautiful. 
We have had numerous construction jobs performed over the years, (pool installation, patio install, room additions, etc) and Eitan was always available either by phone or coming by to check, and everyone who worked on the remodel was friendly, professional, always cleaned up and tried to help minimalize the impact of dust, smell and noise as much as possible.
I will definitely look to Horizon for any further work."
5,"I met with David Eskin from Horizon Construction; he was very friendly and professional.  We discussed the projected and my expectations.  Within a few days, David had the estimate ready and we met for a second time.  When we met to review the proposal, David went through everything in detail.  

A few days later, I called David and told him that I would like Horizon to be the contractor for my project.  We then agreed on a starting date.  I told David I would be out of the country during the beginning phases of the project.  He assured me that wouldn’t be a problem and would keep me posted throughout the process.  

I really enjoyed going to their showroom to pick out the materials for the project, I felt like a kid in a candy store.  David was there through that process as well and offered suggestions if asked.  

Everything went smoothly for the most part throughout the process.  Some issues came up regarding the electrical panel, this was no fault of David’s, and he was quick to resolve the issues.  David was always quick to respond to my text messages or emails to address any questions or concerns I might have had.  

For the most part, the project came out better than anticipated.  Everyone who was involved with this project was always kind, courteous and eager to assist.  

Thank you, Horizon!!!

5,"We were very happy with the work done by Horizon
Construction on our remodeling project. We love our 1954
suburban home, but the two bathrooms were in serious need
of updating. Horizon started work and we immediately knew
we were in good hands. The workmanship on the floor and
shower tile was superb. In our master bath we had custom tiles
installed in the shampoo shelf that made our shower really
shine. The workers in charge of painting, vanity installation
and plumbing were very friendly and professional. We felt
very comfortable having them in our house. They answered
questions and communicated their progress to us. The overall
job was done in a timely manner and we were always informed
of any delays.
David the project manager kept us updated throughout the
entire process and helped us to realize our vision of a
southwestern style guest bathroom. He took care of all the
paperwork with our city's permit process. We were given
notice of any delays and he responded to texts immediately.
On one occasion, while we were shopping for vanities at a local
warehouse, he texted with us for over half an hour to make
sure we got the right one. Halfway through the project we
decided to re-pipe our entire house and David made that
happen. His plumbing crew had the re-pipe done in two days.
We feel confident recommending Horizon for your remodeling
needs. They respected our house and it showed in their work.
We can't wait to show off our new bathrooms to friends and
family!"
5,"We wanted to remodel for a long time.  Had interviewed several contractors. We didn’t know anyone here.  When we met David from Horizon we felt safe. He understood our vision and helped us clarify it. We liked that Horizon is 1 stop destination with a showroom, this is truly helpful in this process. We chose David Eskin with Horizon Construction and Remodeling, Inc. to and it turned beautiful. We Loved All horizon workers.  We had few communication glitches but those were resolved right away. David did a great job keeping his cool and listening to all our questions and concerns and was on top of it right away ready to explain and resolve. 
My only feedback will be in this area - to try and explain the clients more so less questions will arise. 
Overall we are very satified with our new kitchen and 2 new bathrooms and recommend Horizon construction and remodeling in Fullerton CA 
to others !"
5,"I contracted Horizon to do a remodel of a portion of the house that converted an old bedroom and master/bathroom, into a modern master with a large bedroom and guest bathroom. The initial budget was doubled what was targeted due to many unexpected expenses (some due to my request, others due to lack of foresight in planning).

The workmanship was of good quality generally but there were areas where attention to detail was not taken. 

The customer service has been the best part of working with Horizon. When problems arose with plumbing down the line, the company was responsive and helped fix the issue and even help with one that was due to the fixtures. They also did not charge for small minor requests (swapping faucet on an unrelated portion of the house).

Overall, I would say that the experience is positive."
5,"Horizon Construction recently completed a fireplace remodel in my home.  This was our first attempt at any major work here.  They were very professional and did a great job.  There were times when they had to work around my schedule and times when workers remained until evening to finish a project.  
I appreciate the prompt responses I received from Mike and the office staff when I had questions. He made good suggestions and had explanations about the process.  As in another review, the cost was significant for a one-wall redo, but I’m very happy with the result.  
There’s a small adjustment needed in the recessed lighting, but I’m confident this will be finished soon.  Overall, I think they were professional and easy to work with."
5,"While searching for a quartz counter top to coordinate with my existing beige flooring, I discovered Horizon.  They had what I wanted and secured a backsplash with a mosaic to complete the color scheme. Mark is a hands on contractor-owner .  He oversees every step of the job and there is little down time in the process.  The workers willingly try to accommodate customer requests.  If an installation is not satisfactory, it is corrected.  Horizon does an excellent job for the price charged.

4,"After poor experiences with previous contractors, we came into our next home repair project with reservations and a long check-list of characteristics we wanted in our next contractors, including responsiveness, professionalism, expertise, and follow-through.  Horizon was one of the half dozen businesses we solicited.

If cost was the only factor, Horizon would not have been selected.  While the company provided discounts, its estimate was triple the lowest bid and thousands more than another contractor we were considering.

We met Rey and Omri, and we were impressed with the way they addressed our concerns and exuded pride in the company’s reputation for high customer service and satisfaction.

We got what we paid for:
• Jobs were completed as scheduled (or there was sufficient communication and transparency during the few times complications arose).
• Horizon was responsive, both in its communication and follow-through with requests.
• Workmanship and attention to detail was excellent.
• The company handled minor incidental items without charging us extra.
• Half a year later, we contacted the business about a warranty issue.  • The company was prompt in its response, and the problem was fixed within a few days.

It is evident Horizon values maintaining positive relations with its customers.  If price is not the sole determinant, we recommend the company and will continue to keep it at the top of our list for future remodeling projects."
5,"I bought a house last year and worked with David to remodel the kitchen, master bathroom and guest bathroom. David was professional and had great design ideas. He designed the layouts and helped me selecting the materials for the kitchen and the bathrooms. The transformation was amazing. The open floor plan between the kitchen and the family room makes the house looks incredible expansive. The projects were finished on time and passed all the inspections. The final results were exactly as my vision of my house should be!"
4,"As is common with many construction projects, we experienced several issues and it took longer than originally planned. However, David and Mark addressed and corrected all issues, even ripping out and starting over on several items when necessary. Despite the issues and timing delays, Horizon did come in on budget, and we absolutely love the new bathrooms and bedroom floor!"
5,"Horizon construction built a bathroom for me in my detached recreational space. The room was transformed from a simple and basic recreational room into a livable and enjoyable space that is perfect for single travels or couples looking to stay in a comfy and welcoming space while visiting our lovely state of California. David and his construction team finished the job in just over a month, on budget and on time. I would recommend Horizon construction to others looking room additions or things similar to what we had done to our home."
5,"I found Horizon Construction on the Houzz app after several attempts to connect with a few other contractors. I sent an email on a Sunday and got a response the following Monday. The great communication with Horizon continued through my entire project of a complete remodel of my kitchen, guest bathroom and walk in closet. They also installed all new windows and tile flooring. My project manager was David and he was the best, made himself available to me for all of my many questions and decisions even while he was on vacation! Working with Enna and the others at the office were perfect as well. I couldn’t be more pleased with the outcome of my remodel. 

Best Regards,
Debbie Karmelich"
5,Thank you Horizon for all your help making our guest/additional bathroom for my mother who recently moved in with us a place she loves.  David was very kind and understanding of what we wanted and the crews that came to work were very professional.  We look forward to having additional work done in our house by Horizon so all of our rooms can be just as beautiful.
5,"Horizon did a terrific job on a complete makeover of our master bathroom (including the shower, jacuzzi, flooring, counter-tops, sinks, and cabinetry) and the replacement of all kitchen cabinetry, drawers, and sink.  This was a big project for us -- so it was important to select a contractor who was reliable, had all the right skill sets, and was committed to quality.  Horizon delivered on all fronts with flying colors!

We found Horizon through Angie’s List.  After reading comments on Angie’s List and on many other web sites such as BBB and Yelp, we decided to get estimates from Horizon and three other service providers.   After our initial interview with each prospective provider, we concluded that Horizon provided the most comprehensive services at pricing that was very competitive.    

Our project involved a variety of skillsets including woodworking, plumbing, electrical, tile installation, fabrication and cutting of counter-top surfaces, and finishing and painting.  Rather than hiring a jack-of-all trades, Horizon delivered highly skilled craftsmen in each field who completely embraced Horizon’s expectations for quality.

Our Horizon project manager David was instrumental to the success of our project.  David did a great job coordinating and supervising the work of each of the craftsmen.  David was very responsive and easy to reach when questions arose.  David was on site regularly to inspect progress and assure that the craftsmen met Horizon’s high expectations for quality.  On occasions when David noted items requiring special attention, the craftsmen were eager to respond.  David was also very responsive and attentive to all observations we shared as the project progressed.  It was clear that the craftsmen all shared Horizon’s deep commitment to quality.  The craftsmen were also very courteous and productive throughout the duration of our project.  

We are very pleased with the end-product and the process Horizon followed from start to finish (including design suggestions and assistance with surface material selections).  Thank you very much to all of the Horizon project team (including the back-office team) for a job well done! 

We wholeheartedly recommend using Horizon and will most certainly use Horizon for any projects we undertake in the future."
5,"(Originally written about 3.5 months after job completion).  I must admit that we were highly cautious with our next bathroom remodel hire. Reason being was a previous contractor abandoned our master bathroom remodel after attempts to have them address valid concerns. That other contractor's license was eventually suspended after multiple consumer complaints were filed. Thankfully, working with Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc on addressing a previous contractor's mess ups and then completing a redo of another bathroom in our home was a much better experience. The new remodel job that was Horizon's from start to finish was completed in a timely manner. With our older house, there were issues uncovered after the demo process that were not too much of a surprise. The issue extended our timeline and did add somewhat minor costs to the job. When questions or concerns were raised, Mike Roppo, our project leader, was responsive to address issues and provide explanations before the job moved forward. I must state that some of the worksite conditions at the end of a couple jobs were not ideal. For example, white residue was left on our hedges and some of our walkway from workers mixing materials - possibly grout. Also, workers left cigarette butts in our newly installed small rocks landscaping that couldn't just get swept out easily. Workers did clean up nicely for all interior jobs. Finally, after completion of both bathrooms, two more events occurred. First, Horizon came out and made repairs that surfaced, like settling cracks in the grout for example. This was part of their contract, but it was done in a timely fashion. Second, Horizon was helpful with our complaint to the contractor license board by providing a statement of the condition of the bathroom remodel that was abandoned. Overall, we would include Horizon on our list of contractors to work with again."
5,"Sounds corny but it is true – When you deal with Horizon Construction & remodeling, you are treated like family. 
It’s my last major project and I have been putting it off for many years. Life happened and it is never the right time to remodel. But, we are glad we finally did it!
 They are very patient people and never made me feel indecisive despite the fact that I am. I doubt there are many firms in the entire country that are genial and comfortable and just plain nice. Also, they explain everything in as much or as little detail as you want and all those details are laid out in an organized and thorough fashion. Everyone there is super professional. They are a treasure.
Love my new house !
Thank you Horizon Construction and remodeling"
5,"We were impressed with everyone we interacted with at Horizon, especially our contact person named Mike.  They finished the project before estimated time and there were no extra charges for anything!  We would recommend this company to our family and friends."
5,"Frequently a home renovation is not for the faint-of-heart. There are countless general contractors to choose from, some first-rate and some unscrupulous, and which one to hire is often the biggest unknown factor in a successful execution of transforming an idea into fruition. In my case I could not be happier. Mark Besnos, his wife Enna and all the team at Horizon were absolutely the best. Having done many a previous renovation on properties over the years, I can truthfully say that Mark's diligence and demand for perfection overseeing my project is something I've seldom witnessed before. He is more than a simple ""hammer and nails"" contractor: Mark is a symbiosis of one part architectural engineer with the aesthetic eye of an interior designer. With his immense help we were able to harmoniously blend the various colors of granite, travertine tile, cabinetry and backsplash, updating a tired mid-century ranch home kitchen into a Tuscan showplace."
1,"Horizon Construction & Remodeling in 2018 lied about getting City inspections done, damaged my home and covered up the damage, and left dangerous conditions throughout my home, leaving myself and my family at risk. For example, just some of the things Inspectors found: sharp roof shingles unattached on my roof which could have fallen and cut us; they left exposed electrical wiring in the attic = potential fire danger; extremely hot pipes not insulated, which could have burnt us, and more. The City is making me remove construction Horizon did because they lied about getting approval. DO NOT HIRE THEM. They are a dangerous company. They also gave a portion of the remodel to another general contractor (not as a subcontractor) without my approval.  Horizon Construction (Mark Besnos) did not supervise this other contractor, who’s license has been suspended and is being prosecuted by the California Attorney General’s Office. All of this can be confirmed.  This was a big project and Horizon Construction & Remodeling took my money and have left my entire family devastated by the amount of damage they did to our home."
5,"We just completed our remodel of two bathrooms with Horizon Construction. We are very happy with the final product. The work was completed on a timely basis with great communication regarding scheduling, problem solving and attention to any issues that came up. We did have a few issues that needed some attention, but they were completed to our satisfaction. I was very nervous when we first started the project because I am very detail oriented and was afraid the work  might not meet our expectations- but it most certainly does. 

David was our project manager and always responded back to any issues that came up on a very timely basis- always available via phone or email, even on weekends. The office staff was equally responsive, and that made this project so much easier to deal with. 

We did have a little delay due to the rainy weather over the last couple of months, but other than that, someone was here working pretty much every day since our project started the first week of January . 

 Very happy with our choice of Horizon and highly recommend them for your remodeling needs."
5,"We chose Horizon Construction & Remodeling for our project.    They are a family owned business that provides outstanding customer service.  Our project was a kitchen and living room remodel.  Our home was built in the early 50’s with the center piece of the home being an indoor bar-b-que taking up most of one wall of a very small kitchen and a massive fireplace in the living room.  After weeks of delays and concerns from the city, an engineer and architect from Horizon were brought in to help finalize plans.  The final decision was to remove the massive brick structure.  The kitchen and living room were gutted, fireplace and bar-be-que demolished and a new wall was constructed.   We especially liked that everything we needed was on display at their showroom and the staff was extremely patient and helpful as we make our choices.  Throughout the remodel our project manager, David, and the office staff kept us informed as to what was happening and who was coming to work the next day.  Each day the crew working cleaned up and did not leave a mess.  David, Enna, Genesis and the office staff were always very professional and constantly checking as to how we were doing since we stayed in the home throughout the remodel.  We are extremely pleased with the job done for us by Horizon Construction &Remodeling and we highly recommend them.
Rick and Sandy Lewis"
5,"The team at Horizon Construction & Remodeling has given us the master suite of our dreams! My wife and I love our mid-century house, but the master bathroom left a lot to be desired. Our project manager, Mike, helped us maximize the space by borrowing from a largely unused kitchenette area and was able to include every single one of the custom cabinets, appliances, and fixtures we set our hearts on. Now we have a luxurious, spacious bathroom and a lovely bar area with plenty of storage that will be excellent for entertaining guests. Although there are always some complications in a remodel this large, the whole process went very smoothly and Horizon took care of us at every step - we were always left feeling our home was in the best hands. Thank you so much for helping us fall in love with our house all over again!"
5,"From the very first phone call I made to Horizon I felt valued as a client. The office staff was always kind and helpful. Our project manager, David, was easy to work with and was always responsive to any questions or concerns. He stopped by frequently to check the progress throughout the project and kept us informed of the next phase and work scheduling. All the tradesmen involved were professional, respectful of our home, great to talk with and did an excellent job. Any remodeling project can be stressful, but I believe that the service we received from Horizon made the process as smooth as possible.  We love our beautiful new kitchen and bathroom. I would highly recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling for any home project and would certainly use them again."
5,Mark Besnos and his crew at Horizon Construction and Remodeling did an awesome job on all of my remodel projects in my home. I especially like that if there is something that you don’t quite like they will fix it for you right away. I recommend them because I love how everything turned out and I will use them again for my next project!
5,"Horizon Construction did an awesome job on our Kitchen Remodel.  We put off remodeling for so many years but upon reading all the good reviews on this company we finally decided it was time.  The outcome was exactly how I envisioned it.  David, our project manager, as well as everyone in the office were always available to help us with any little (or big) question or concern.  We were always told what to expect at each stage and all the contractors were very professional and always kept the work area clean each evening.  All deadlines where met as scheduled and no ""surprise"" costs were incurred.   Thank You Horizon Construction and Remodeling"
5,"I interviewed multiple contractors to complete a full bathroom remodel for 3 bathrooms.  I ultimately chose Horizon because I knew they would be the right fit for the project I was undertaking.  They are a small family owned business that has the customer’s satisfaction in the forefront of their minds.   We agreed that we would complete the project in two phases.  We completed a hall and master bathroom remodel first with the third bathroom to take place after the first of the year.  
Both Horizon and their subcontractors are available to answer questions and assist with any decision making you may need or ideas to make your project have an outcome that you are 100% satisfied with.  The workmanship, timeliness and cleanliness of each subcontractor was impeccable.  I would highly recommend Horizon for your next remodel."
4,"I started this bathroom remodel with a different contractor - but it didn’t go well. So I hired Horizon Construction & Remodeling and my bathroom is absolutely stunning. I will recommend them to friends and family. David my project manager was great, he always assured me that all will be taken care for me and I actually could sleep good at night. And I did ! I’m very happy ! 
Any questions that come out were addressed in a very timely manner. 
Which made me feel very comfortable. 
Now the project is complete it looks absolutely wonderful beyond my expectations 
My family and I really love it!"
5,"I interviewed three contractors and chose Mark Besnos and Horizon for an extensive interior remodel of my home – master bedroom and bath, guest bathroom, kitchen.  The project included removing a soffit ceiling in about half the house, installing a new support beam to eliminate a post, wainscoting in the living and dining room, hardwood flooring in the renovated areas (except the bathrooms), two new windows, and a new fireplace mantel.  Mark wasn’t the least expensive but based on his experience and our discussion I felt he would be “hands on” and would provide guidance during the course of the project.  Mark has excellent taste.  He was patient and worked with me and my cousin (who was consulting with me) very well.  He was earnest in trying to accommodate his visits to my work schedule.  A project of this magnitude is bound to encounter some challenges, and Mark was good at explaining them and presenting options, while giving me time to reflect.  The various trades who worked on my home were top notch, and when there were some issues Mark immediately took steps to correct, fix, re-do, what needed to be done. An example is the flooring.  There was a haze on the floor and Mark contacted the manufacturer and called in and paid (at his expense) a professional to inspect the floor and make recommendations.  Mark and his team were always on top of things, communicating often via email (my preference) and also texts.  The end result has exceeded my expectations.  I am thrilled with my new, open concept, home.  The kitchen is amazing, the fireplace is a focal point, and I absolutely love my master bathroom.   We had some fun with the guest bathroom as well.  Now I need artwork!  Bottom line . . . if someone leaves me a house in his or her will and I have to remodel it, I’m calling Mark and Horizon."
5,We love Horizon. We wanted to do an exterior remodel and contacted them. They were there every step of the way and always available when we had questions. They were on time and kept to their schedule. They constantly kept us updated on the project. Mark is great...he listened to what we were thinking and helped make it reality.  We really liked that Mark let’s you know if there are any problems and helps come up with solutions. They take care of their customers!  Enna was also amazing and was always available to answer questions. We will use them again for our next project!
5,Horizon did a wonderful job with our kitchen. They were clear communicators all along the way and went the extra mile to accommodate our requests. We love our new kitchen!
5,"My wife and I made the decision to completely remodel our 55 year old kitchen which included removing a couple of walls to open it up to the dining room and living room. After deeply vetting numerous contractors and securing proposals, we selected Horizon Construction in Fullerton, CA. Mark Besnos, company owner, was by far the most detail oriented and considerate home improvement contractor we’ve ever worked with. Throughout all phases of the project, Horizon provided extraordinary workmanship in a very timely manner. Of course with any major project there are a few challenges. Horizon Construction remedied every issue with effective contingency plans for any problem they encountered.  Here is an excellent example of superior service: We selected and ordered quartz counter tops from MSI of Orange, CA.  When the quartz counter tops arrived and were installed, they had a number of finishing defects which Horizon tried to repair. Unfortunately, the defects were irreparable and MSI would not stand behind their product and workmanship. Mark and Horizon Construction however alleviated our aggravation by selflessly offering us a partial financial reimbursement even though the counter top finishing was not Horizon’s responsibility. 
From beginning to completion, Horizon Construction exhibited professionalism, pride of workmanship and a commitment to excellence. If you are seeking the finest company to successfully bring your remodeling dreams to reality, Horizon Construction is unquestionably the one!"
5,"We were referred to Horizon Construction from a neighbor that had recently hired them for a bathroom & kitchen remodel.  Although Horizon’s was quote was higher than previous quotes, we went with them based on the quality of workmanship we saw in my neighbor’s home plus their great online reviews. 
The first couple of weeks went well. We were told the job would take 4-5 weeks to complete. The first round of workers and inspector were on schedule. Around week three things slowed down.  The tile guy only worked between 3-5 hours a day. We ran into a couple problems with paint that resulted in “do-overs”.  Some of the mistakes made by the painters were somewhat novice. However our project manager was quick to respond and correct the issues. The job was completed at the end of week five.
At the end, our experience with Horizon Construction was a great one. The office staff and project manager were pleasant and attentive to our concerns.  We are happy with the work done in our bathroom and would consider using them again in the future.  I highly recommend Horizon Construction to anyone looking to do a remodel/construction in their home."
5,"It went great! Enna ,David and the entire Horizon Group were a pleasure to work with. Expectations clearly communicated and met. Trades arrived when scheduled, on time and prepared. The few problems that came up were quickly resolved to our satisfaction. We are planning further work next year and will use Horizon Construction and Remodel again. We have full confidence that we will be treated as fairly and professionally as we were on this project"
5,"We contracted with Horizon Construction and Remodeling to remodel all three of our bathrooms.  Mark, Enna and the administrative staff were fully involved throughout the project providing updates, schedule reminders and addressing all of our concerns along the way.  While we were upgrading the two upstairs bathrooms, we had a family of 5 sharing a downstairs shower.  Mark was good about keeping the project moving forward and getting us use of the upstairs bathrooms as soon as possible.  During the demo work, we uncovered bathtub rust.  Mark covered the options and was able to work in the schedule a replacement with a project quick change order.  We also decided midflight of the remodel that the existing cabinets were not going to work.  Mark once again was able to provide options for us to address within our timeframe and budget.  As during any remodel big or small, issues and challenges will arise.  Mark and the whole Horizon team went out of their way to make sure my wife and I were extremely pleased with the process and end results.  We very much appreciated the communication, periodic onsite morning meetings and the breakdown of payments spread throughout the 4 month project that allowed us a little more control of the finances.  Overall, we appreciated the honesty, upfront discussions, and their dedication to details to make our bathrooms beautiful.  We would not hesitate to contract with them again.  Thank you Mark, Enna and the whole Horizon Construction and Remodel team."
5,"I have been wanting to remodel my kitchen for several years and the opportunity finally presented itself.
Horizon was recommended to me by my neighbor so I decided to include them in the process of choosing a contractor.
All of the contractors provided about the same cost to do the remodel but my final decision went to Horizon. 
I choose Horizon to do the job because first impressions do matter and Horizon impressed me with their professional manner and responsiveness. 
When the job started I was again pleased with the scheduling and notifications I received from Enna and Genesis. Like most people, I am a busy person and I like to be informed and prepared. Being kept in the loop about the activity at my home was very helpful and appreciated.




During the remodel process my home and garage were cleaned up and neat when I arrived home, always a welcome sight! The kitchen was completed before the scheduled end date which was a great surprise. But most of all the kitchen is gorgeous! The workmanship is beautiful and the I couldn't be happier with the result! I would definitely recommend Horizon to anyone wanting or needing to start a construction project!"
5,"We want to thank Horizon Construction & Remodeling, Inc. 
Especially Enna & David for our BEAUTIFUL  makeover kitchen.
They were really helpful in helping us select our cabinets, counter tops and backsplash and the color combination for our kitchen.
David was great! 
He was here and checked each phase of the work and made sure all work was done satisfactory.
the workers were great in their preparation and cleaning up before leaving.
Thank you again Horizon, we are very pleased with the work done!"
5,"You can feel comfortable hiring Horizon Construction and Remodeling for your next house project!  I had to do lots of repair and maintenance on my Queen Anne Victorian home and Project Manager Mike and the folks at Horizon came through with flying colors.   I replaced the roof, cleaned and re-insulated the attic, added new floors upstairs, upgraded some electrical, repaired plater ceilings and painted the exterior with a three color ""Painted Lady"" look for the house.  All the sub-contractors were polite, fine craftsmen and always on time. Mike was great communicating  with me at all times.  This situation has not always been true for contractors I've interviewed to work on my house.  Usually, they come to the house, say they will give me an estimate, and never call back.  Horizon and their team did  high quality work on a difficult older home."
5,"Horizon Construction and Remodeling recently remodeled my kitchen and I highly recommend their work.  They completed my project on time and on budget.

Our project manager, Mike, was a positive force from beginning to end.  Anytime I texted him he answered back right away, every time.  He was always on top of things and very sensitive to any concerns I might have.

The staff at Horizon was also great.  They kept me informed every step along the way as to what was going to be done next.  Each day after work was completed the workers left the area extremely clean.  They never left a mess at any time which I appreciated.

It was a remarkably stress free remodel and the results were exactly as I had envisioned.  I will definitely use them again for any project in the future."
5,"I chose Horizon to do a complete kitchen remodel, add an additional 100 square feet and create a 9’ pass through between the kitchen and family room.  This entailed major construction – engineering, demo, footings, support beams, framing, insulation, electrical, plumbing, paint, floor tile, cabinets, countertops, and installing appliances.  
 
Mark Besnos, the owner, was the project manager and Enna and Genesis (back office) provided education and guidance throughout the entire project.  The approximate timeline given was three months; it was finished in two months.  Mark worked with me in building the kitchen in stages to ensure I was able to stay within my budget. 
 
Mark made suggestions along the way (which I appreciated) – I agreed with some and others I didn’t.  For instance, during construction, he prompted me to think about raising the ceiling – I’m very thankful I agreed with his recommendation – it worked out well.  There was never any pressure to do anything I didn’t want to do. 
 
Communication is always the key to success.  I was always aware of the next steps.  Whenever I had questions, Mark or Enna promptly answered.  They even answered questions and concerns while they were on vacation – they are dedicated to their profession. There were some small concerns or issues along the way – they were addressed and resolved in a timely manner which was greatly appreciated.
 
This has been an educational and rewarding experience.  A lot has to do with the relationship established with the client.  The Besnos family (Mark and Enna), from the beginning, have been friendly, patient, honest and trustworthy.
 
I now have a beautiful dream kitchen to enjoy with family.  Thank you Mark and Enna."
5,The Horizon team did an OUTSTANDING job at my home. We had a bathroom remodel which they basically completely redesigned and it looks absolutely amazing!!! So happy with the outcome and service!
4,"We searched on all popular web sites to look for a recommended contractor.  Horizon beat out other companies and we met with Mark, the owner.  I explained to Mark what we were wanting and looking for.  Horizon was very timely and on task.  They always kept me in the loop of what I needed to do and what they were going to work on.  When I changed some of the design or wanted tile to be redone, Mark came right over and addressed the issues.  I liked how all of the workers cleaned up after themselves as well. All of Horizen’s employee’s were professional and friendly. Our kitchen looks great and functions so much better.  Our kids want to cook too.  Thank you Horizon."
5,"Our dream to remodel our kitchen began a couple of years ago.   We interviewed contractors but none worked out or followed up with us.   We began to again search in the summer of 2017 and met with Mark of Horizon Construction as well as with other contractors.  We were especially impressed when we visited the Horizon  office to see cabinets and other materials.  Also, we were very impressed by Ena and the staff.   Mark had great ideas and helped us design a new kitchen for us. Work began in mid November (due to our schedule)  and progressed well with workers showing up on time almost every day.  Work included demolition, replacing all cabinets with granite tops and tile backsplash, creating an island with a sink which involved moving plumbing, widening of the doorway between the kitchen and dinning room, enclosure of a preexisting sliding door,  new floors in the hallways, kitchen and dining rooms and creating a new gas line and venting exhaust for the new range and other electrical upgrades.   The work progressed smoothly despite a few bumps in the road.  Mark made certain all work was done to his high expectations.   Ena and the office staff were always available to answer our questions.  Inspections went smooth and quickly.   The job was completed on schedule and to our satisfaction.   We highly recommend Horizon Construction and will not hesitate to call on them again for future projects."
5,"The complete remodel of one of our bathrooms was just completed by Horizon Construction last week. The bathroom is gorgeous. I could not be happier. The project manager, David, was constantly on top of the scheduling and progression of the work. He visited almost every day to make sure everything was going to plan and always asked if we had any questions or problems. Any issues that came up were immediately addressed. Compared to many contractors I have dealt with, the communication was wonderful.  The quality of the work was top notch and the various tradespeople (plumbers, electricians, painters, tile-setters, etc.) were all very pleasant and helpful. They were always on time per the schedule or if there was a delay, we received a timely e-mail and re-schedule time. The job was completed on time per the original promise date. The clean up at the end of the job was professionally done. I would highly recommend Horizon Construction for any remodeling job."
5,"Horizon construction and remodeling Inc. did our whole home meaning total kitchen remodeling (cabinets tile counters lighting), upstairs bathroom (tile flooring and vanity), all trim molding crown molding, wall repair, texture coat, painting everywhere, stairway new banister, carpet, vinyl plank flooring, back/ front doors, all electrical with new lights/ ceiling fans and interior doors. What a Beautiful job!! We couldn't be happier!! Kitchen looks like a model in a show room. The whole house is such a transformation that we feel like we're on vacation!! Mark and his workers were on time and so courteous. Horizon show room makes it so easy to pick out your products and it's not confusing. We would with no hesitation recommend Horizon  for All your remodeling needs inside and outside of your home. Thank You to All the Horizon work team!!

5,"Great service and professional workers! The company contractor and team were prompted on time, answered all the questions I had and performed the remodeling project in proficiency! Definitely recommended!"
5,"We met Horizon Construction & Remodeling Representative after meeting 2 other contractors and we must say we liked Horizon a lot.
The project manager was very knowledgeable and personable
He listen to us and made good suggestions and was always available for us
we honestly couldn't do this project without him!
It took longer than we planned because the remodel was done around the holiday season but it was worth it! The END product is beautiful 
We receive many compliments from family & friends
We appreciate the hard work - all workers were very dedicated and talented
We will spread the GOOD WORD ABOUT HORIZON!!!"
5,"We love the new bathroom! The old bathroom was cramped, damp and colored pink (the house was build in 1957). The only venting was the window. My father requires a full time caregiver and there was barely enough room in the bathroom for one grown man let alone two. Mark came up with an excellent floor plan and matched his ideas with our hopes and wishes. The bathroom was completely gutted. The plumbing for the shower (with shower head and hand shower) was added and the plumbing for the toilet and the vanity sink was moved. Three areas of lighting were added--over the vanity, over the toilet, and in the shower. A combination venting fan/light was installed. An additional electrical outlet was installed. The bathroom window was replaced. Floor to ceiling tile was installed for the shower as was a channel drain (the shower is 8 feet wide). The project was finished not only on time but 12 days early. The entry into the bathroom and the new shower can now accommodate a person in a wheelchair. Not only is it functional, it's beautiful in its modern palette of neutral grays, tans and creams. All work was professionally done and supervised by Mark. After the project was completed, Mark and Enna called to follow up. When there was an issue with the shower not draining, I made one call and Mark's workers were out the next morning to fix it. This was my first remodel project and on a whole it much better than I had hoped it could be. We are very satisfied and will be hiring Horizon for future projects."
5,"We chose Horizon to refresh the exterior of our home based upon the good ratings in Angie’s List and Houzz.  They were very prompt in setting a time to meet with us.  Leo listened very well to what we wanted to have done and then he walked us through how they would go about getting the job done.  He detailed for us the many steps they would go through to prepare for the work that would need to be done for removing old facade, adding new stucco, painting, adding stone veneer and replacing patio fence.  He explained some of the extra steps they do that others skip, which are important for a long-lasting result.  Leo laid out for us the expected start time and timeline for completion.  Based upon some other estimates that I had received, Horizon’s cost estimate was very reasonable.  Their back-office staff was also very helpful to us in selecting the materials to be used on the job and working with us on scheduling.  Once the job got started, it progressed according to plan, and all city inspections were completed timely without need for any change to the work they had done.  The job was completed to our satisfaction, on time and on budget; they even did a few extra add-ons without charging us anything extra.  Job well done, thank-you!"
5,"Thank you!

Horizon did a great job with my room addition with bathroom and patio.  Now I have a great guest room for when my friends and family come to visit. 

I now start my day on my new patio enjoying my coffee in the shade.  Mike the project manager was wonderful to work with   He was helpful in helping me designing both the interior and exterior layout.  He had a lot of great suggestions and was very knowledgeable.

I will not hesitate to call upon them for any additional work in the future."
5,"Mark and Enna were fantastic!  Mark has an excellent understanding of construction and the realities of renovating a home.  His recommendations reflect his extensive experience and his artistic flare.  We found that by listening to him, his ideas proved to be a better fit than our original ideas.  We are so very glad that we took his advice, especially regarding our kitchen remodel.  Horizon has an entire showroom of materials and other construction examples at their Fullerton location.  This made the selection of materials extremely convenient.  We also found that their material options were of very good quality.  We love the back-splash that we picked out in our kitchen!

When we first met Mark, he was 5 minutes early to our appointment.  Everyone we dealt with after the initial meeting was either early or exactly on time.  We never had to wait for anyone.  When a repair was needed or a concern arose, Enna resolved the matter very quickly, sometimes within the hour.  They were very up front about what was being done and they stayed on budget.  We moved out of our house for 2 months and they had us back in exactly on schedule.  No surprises.  Our home was very outdated and needed some serious attention and that is exactly what we got.  We would hire Horizon Construction and Remodeling again without question."
5,"In October 2018 I met with Mike, Project Manager, from Horizon Construction to do a basic kitchen & wet bar remodel.  He was very easy to work with and explained the process very clearly. Horizon replaced all my cabinets, installed new granite counter tops, backsplash, sinks and faucets, and painted the room. This was to be completed in 4 weeks, but ended up taking a little over 5 weeks as there were issues with some cabinets, backsplash, and minor electrical problems. Every concern or even complaint I voiced was immediately addressed and corrected. They all are focused on providing excellent customer service and making sure their clients are satisfied. Enna, owner, contacted me recently to ask if there was anything else I needed, and this was a month after completion. Cost of the project was within the budget I had allowed and felt their costs are reasonable and competitive. Even with the extra week to complete the project, the result, is a beautiful new kitchen, island and wet bar. I may be remodeling another room and would hire Horizon Construction again as their concern for customer satisfaction stands out…"
5,"Work was done in a timely fashion, and the quality was excellent. Each stage of the project was 
managed well, all workers were punctual and did a good job of cleaning up after work was done. Work 
was completed ahead of schedule and we were very happy with the final results."
4,"Project: Re-pipe whole house and install tankless water heater; replace ducts and install new AC/Furnace unit; remodel two bathrooms.

After speaking to three general construction companies, we decided to hire Horizon Construction for our projects. Their prices were reasonable as compared to the other companies, and we appreciated the detailed written scope of the project that they provided to us. Mark, Enna, and their office staff were very pleasant to work with; they also have a very nice showroom.

Overall, we are happy with how our projects turned out. Enna is great with communications. She always replied to our messages promptly to address our issues and concerns. We did have various issues with the workmanship and cleanliness of some of the trades that came to do the work, which made us felt that the project manager was not always attentive to what was being done at our house. We had to clean up a lot of the messes that were left every night when came home. Horizon could definitely benefit as a company, if they improve their ability to oversee a project more closely to ensure that things are being done properly by their sub-contractors. But, in general, Mark and Enna do care about the satisfaction of their customers. They are committed to making things right. They always made sure that we were happy with the end result. We never felt like Enna or Mark would just ignore us or our concerns. For this reason alone, we would recommend their company to others."
5,"We loved the fact Horizon had a nice showroom where we could find everything we liked. It made all decision process much easier for us. 
Mark Besnos did excellent job, he planned everything very well. The communication was great and easy. Enna Eskin was helpful at office and over emails. We love our new kitchen it is just like we imagined even better ! This is now a perfect summer house for our big family 
Thank you Horizon !"
5,"Well, I wish I had something fun and exciting like a room addition or kitchen remodel to talk about, but our project was just a boring, complicated, extensive repair/renovation. For more than a decade, every time we had a major storm, we got flooding in our family room, and every time we thought we had fixed the problem, when the next storm came, the water re-appeared. We talked to several contractors, and they all had pretty much the same opinion. Since we couldn’t figure our the source or sources of the leaking, the only way to fix it for sure would be to completely remove and replace the stucco and paper from the rear of the house, and replace all the windows. This would also involve detaching and disassembling a large, wood patio cover, and then putting it back together. One contractor didn’t even want to take the job.

We chose Horizon due to a high recommendation from my brother who had used them for a kitchen re-model. The estimate and bid process was quick and smooth, and communication and scheduling with Enna and the office was great throughout. Mark was quick to address the problems, which were many, due to the fact that, as it turned out, our leaks were coming from more than one source.

The quality of the work, for the most part was excellent. In fact, the building inspector commented that the workmanship of the wrapping job was the best he had ever seen. My only complaint is that the work of the window installers was less than stellar, but all-in-all,  the final outcome was good. The color and texture of the stucco also perfectly matches the rest of the house.

We did a water test, and all looks good. We won’t know for sure until the next big storm, but I’m confident that we’ll have a dry family room. so confident, In fact, that we just installed new carpet."
5,Mark and team just finished giving our old house a face lift. Outstanding job! Mark gave us some great advice on how make the house look its best. His input/opinions matched our taste. Mark's attention to details and the quality of the work ensured the outcome was to our satisfaction. We would definitely recommend them and use them again on our next project. (New garage doors are on order...)
5,"After talking to several contractors, we reached out to Horizon Construction for a bid. Mark came out to our house to discuss our project. After talking a while, Mark gave suggestions for changes to the blue prints. It took 7 months with our previous contractor/architect to get the changes made, but they were unquestionably worth the wait. Once we had approval from the city Mark worked us into their busy schedule right away. Mark and his crew worked every day to get our project finished in the timeline they gave us. 
Like most projects there were setbacks, budget changes, and other bumps in the road. However, Mark and his team worked really hard. They did a great job scheduling inspections to keep the job moving. All of the budget changes were because of things we wanted or added not because of his incorrect bid. When issues arose, his office staff was great at contacting us, communicating via phone and email, and answered questions quickly. 
Mark and Enna were a joy to work with, they were punctual, professional, offered good ideas, and allowed us to do some of the work ourselves. Mark is very particular in the way he expects the work to look, he treats his projects likes it is his own place. Mark and Enna always worked diligently to be sure we were happy with the products and services they provided. Despite skepticism from friends and neighbors, Mark was done a few days early. 
We would definitely recommend Horizon Construction to any of our family and friends."
1,"The owner is stuck up and rude. Says he's the owner and is taking his time to come give us an estimate. Says he doesn't do small things and looked like he didn't want to be at our house wasting his precious time. The way he talked and acted throughout the process made me feel like our job was too small for him and we were wasting his time. When I called to book my appointment for a consultation, I was very specific twice about what I needed to be done and asked if our job was too small and the person who setup my appointment said their smallest job was $10k. So he should have already know the job details prior to coming. But when the owner showed up and realized we were small to him he didn't seemed like he wanted to waste his time on us. He quoted me $47k for doing my yard which I had bids from other contractors and the highest bid was $15k. I told him that and he replied that he will hire and attorney and open escrow with $10k and said if I can find someone to do the job for $15k he will give me $10k and if not I need to give him $5k. What he said was unbelievable. I said I'm not going to waste your time anymore and he said EXACTLY and left. On their website it says, ""we are your friendly contractor and want to make it a delightful experience for our customers "". Well, our experience wasn't really delightful and the owner wasn't really friendly! Maybe if I had a million dollar home for him to remodel and the job was hundred of thousands he would've acted and talked differently because he did mention he was working on a $200k pool in Palos Verdes for a $15million home. It's fine if you don't work on small jobs but tell your customers ahead of time instead of coming into their home with no common courtesy.

Thank you for your reply. We did hire someone to do the job. But it’s not the price I’m talking about that is wrong with your company. I’m talking about your owner’s attitude when he came to my house. I think he should at least apologize for that instead of trying to write a response to this review to prove that there was nothing wrong with his attitude and the way he talked to a potential customer. I don’t appreciate it someone that I asked to come give me an estimate to act like the way he did. Thank you for wishing me good luck because I do feel the luckiest part was to not hire your company for the job!"
5,"""We did our research! Horizon construction company was great! The workmanship was beyond our expectations. Our kitchen turned out better then what we thought possible. If you're searching for a construction company for any remodel, give them a call, you will not be disappointed. Thanks to Mike our contractor, he listened to us and gave us great advise.  They even supported us with fixes after the warranty period, just awesome!"""
4,"We were looking around to get a kitchen and bathroom remodel. We met with several contractors but really liked Mike. He was professional, knowledgeable and we liked his design ideas and the quote. 

We ran into unexpected delays from the beginning and that set our timeline back out the gate (asbestos abatement). However, when the project got moving, it took off well. 
There were some other bumps in road that caused delays as well, most were unexpected. 

Overall, we give a four star rating.  Certain aspects of the process were great and others were lacking. 
The office staff was great and tried to be helpful and accommodating. We had been lead to believe that we would have a working toilet and work would be done around it since we only have one bathroom. We had made arrangements for the first few weeks and as we got closer to thanksgiving week and we were aware that little work would be done, it became a problem.  Enna made it work and got the flooring laid and the toilet connected before the holiday. 

The downfall of the process was either scheduling or communication or something.  When we made a change, no matter how big or small, time was added to the timeline. Although technically they finished within the timeline, there were days, on days, on days where little or nothing happened. One day someone came for all of fifteen minutes and then nothing for a week.  We had all the rooms painted and we have never known painting to take so long. The plumber was great. The electrician was great, the framer was great.  They all cleaned up well at the end of the day and the few times it wasn't quite right, Mike was on it and had it taken care of. 
 
Overall we are happy with the end result and would hire Horizon again."
5,"Horizon Construction was such a lucky find for me! I inherited a house from my parents on Balboa Island that was built in 1933. As my parents aged there was a lot of deferred maintenance that needed to be addressed. I had several contractors come and give me estimates and “advice”, but no one took the time like Mike of Horizon Construction did to really find out what I wanted to do and give me realistic quotes.. He was able to preserve the charm and character that the house had, while making it safe and clean with modern amenities. It was a long (8 months+) project, but in that time the quality and care was always there, and my wishes were foremost.  I am happy to give the folks at Horizon Construction “Two Thumbs Up” and would urge anyone wanting a remodel to contact them.

Sincerely,
Suzanne S."
5,"We are happy with the final results of our remodeled kitchen.  Eitan, our Project Manager was the best to work with.  Thank you very much."
4,"Project: Kitchen update: Replaced tile countertops with granite; added backsplash; lowered the bar to counter height and expanded the peninsula.  Installed new sink, induction cook top and downdraft. 

Comments: After talking with other contractors, we chose Horizon Construction who did a nice job with our kitchen update. The workers and project manager were timely, knowledgeable, skilled and neat.  The granite looks awesome and the details around the windows were perfect. The range and the downdraft fit together just right. 

They were fast and completed our project ahead of schedule, a nice plus. It was important to them that we were totally satisfied and when an issue arose, they always had a solution.  We would use them for future remodeling projects."
5,"Nearly 2 years ago Horizon came out and did a major remodel of our downstairs: kitchen, living room, baseboards & flooring, fireplace, etc. It came out beautifully and we were very happy with the results. Recently we were contacted by Horizon again, checking to see how we felt about the remodel at this point. Well, we had a few concerns (cracked cabinet door, uneven drawers, and a crack in the wall where the pantry was installed), which I shared with Enna and within 2 days she had someone out at our home repairing everything, replacing doors, etc. for NO CHARGE! I am impressed by the customer service of this company; its willingness to take care of us so long out from the job was never expected, but definitely appreciated!"
5,"Horizon Construction did a complete  master bath  remodel for me . They did a great job and stayed on schedule . Their attention to detail and finish work was perfect . When  there was a minor  problem Horizon handled it without question . I would highly recommend  and will use them for my next 
remodel needs   
David Sunde"
5,"Horizon Construction & Remodeling and Eitan the project manager were awesome!
I had several projects done: foundation support, stucco, fascia boards, interior and exterior paint and electrical work. 
All were done professionally and perfectly. 
When unexpected issues arose, they were handled quickly & past expectation !
I would definitely use them again"
5,"Enna, Mark and team did a great job with our full kitchen remodel. We knocked down two walls, did a large support beam and gutted the complete kitchen. Mark suggested we move the sink and re-profile the window, which turned out to be an excellent suggestion. We're very happy with the kitchen and can now entertain without being stuck in a very warm and small ""box"" separated from our guests.

Enna spent a lot of time with us near the end of the project to make sure we were satisfied and that everything was to our liking."
5,The bathroom is beautiful.  It was very stressful and I agonized over each decision.  Mike (project manager) and Robert (contractor) helped with decisions and obtaining materials.  Sol was a great worker.  Mike assured me that everything was fixable when I was catastrophizing.  I had to remind myself of that many times.  I'm so glad it's over!  I would recommend them.
5,"My husband and I are so fortunate to have found Horizon Construction on the Houzz website to help us with our master bathroom remodel.  It was extremely important for us to feel that our contractor was listening, paying attention to detail, and caring about doing a great job.  We got all that in spades in working with Eitan Beznos, our lead designer/contractor, who became a trusted friend through every step of the process.  He consistenty monitored the progress and was in contact with us almost daily to ensure we were satisfied with each installation element along the way, take action to address any problems/issues, update us on what/when to expect next, and offer helpful advice on lingering decisions to be made.  He also even helped find the exact tile from a photo I had shown because he knew it would make us happy not having to settle for something else.  Our design concept for the bathroom really came to life, and it really is a showstopper.  We are amazed at how it looks now and are already planning to contract with Horizon again in a few months for our second bathroom remodel."
5,"Our small, old bathroom was starting to have a lot of issues, so we decided a remodel was in order. We found Horizon Construction online and decided to request an estimate based on the reviews. After our first meeting with Mark, we felt comfortable with him and were impressed with professionalism and attention to detail. Their showroom office had many displays and samples that it made it easier for visual people like me and my wife to envision our design. Our bathroom project had a few twists and turns but Mark was very flexible and committed to customer satisfaction. Mark's workers were easy to work with, and the Horizon Construction staff was kind and willing to help with any questions, issues, or concerns we had. All in all, we are happy we got the bigger bathroom we wanted. I would definitely recommend Horizon Construction for home remodels."
5,"We recently had our master bath remodeled by Horizon Construction.  This was our first experience with a remodel contractor and we didn't really know what to expect.  In our first meeting with Mark he made several suggestions that we decided to go with, such as putting in a light above the tub and adding an electrical outlet on the other side of the sink.  

We really appreciated the fact that Horizon had their own showroom and could make suggestions on combinations of tile, vanities and counter materials.  After going to the big box stores and looking at tile and counter top materials and still not knowing what we wanted we found Mark's input invaluable. 

The workmen all were very good at their jobs.  Steps were taken to protect the floors leading to the bathroom under remodel. Trash was removed in a timely manner.  

There were lots of items we needed to purchase in the first couple of days so that when the walls were rebuilt accommodations could be made for the water supply, drains and electrical.  Decisions had to be made along the way and we answered them the same day, so as to not cause a delay in the schedule.  There were a couple of issues that came up and Horizon addressed them as we went along.  

We were so happy with the result that we hesitated to use the bathroom for a couple of days after completion, we didn't want to mess it up.

Bottom line is we wouldn't hesitate to use Horizon Construction again."
5,"I decided to have a load bearing wall removed, which sounds a lot easier than it is. Horizon was the only company I contacted that didn't waffle on giving me an estimate or insist that I must get ""more"" done in order to be taken seriously.  The office staff was friendly and engaging without being pushy and sales crazy.  I found Eitan Beznos, our assigned contractor, to be friendly,  ethical,  receptive, and always a calming influence in the midst of the project, which , as anyone who's had major construction done  knows, can be a real upheaval of a family's day-to-day life. All the workers involved were pleasant and efficient. I was impressed also by the respect and friendliness between the workers and  Eitan.  I'm very big on customer service, and, to me, a homeowner with a quirky mid century home that needs quite a bit of work, I feel like I've found a reputable company that I can trust and partner with to turn my home into the neighborhood jewel that it can be. I'm looking forward to having Horizon remodel my kitchen later this year."
5,"When i decided to redo my kitchen, i was very nervous about who to hire and trust to do the work.
I'm an older widow with NO experience in all of this. 
after quite a few interviews, well, there was no other choice. 
It was HORIZON CONSTRUCTION & REMODELING all the way.
Michael R. was my project manager and really listened to me and was so helpful in all ways.
Robert and his crew was great. He was always there for me, a giant of a guy in all ways.
I couldn't be happier. They finished in 9 days
AND the price was reasonable. 
It turned out beautiful !
I highly recommend HORIZON!!!

5,"I had a bathroom and bedroom remodeled by Horizon. They were reasonable on the overall cost when compared to other quotes obtained. Eitan Beznos did an excellent job overseeing this project. He expressed a sense of care and always wanted to make sure I was pleased with the work before moving on. Overall, the workmanship was excellent and I was always guided to make the best decision possible on material and installation. Their workers were courteous and knowledgeable. Horizon left both rooms looking immaculate and ready for me to move back in. The end result of this project surpassed my expectations with the project completing on time. I highly recommend Horizon for any home project."
5,"Horizon Construction did a beautiful job on our remodel.  Our our family and friends are raving about the difference between before and after.  There so many nice touches that Mark incorporated in the remodel such as the backsplash in the kitchen and including different stone.  The crew were professional, diligent, hard working and
cleaned up after themselves every day.  Mark was flexible and willing to work on any issue without any complaint.  He is a perfectionist which means he demands high quality from his crew.  He was present during all stages of construction and willing to address any concerns promptly.  I highly recommend him and his team."
5,"Our kitchen and downstairs bathroom in our 30 year old home were beginning to look dated and tired, plus we knew if we tore all down, we’d be able to make better use of the space. We hired Horizon Construction after having interviewed three contractors. We immediately liked Mark Beznos because of his professionalism and seriousness about providing us with the best possible choices regarding layout and design, not to mention that his pricing was reasonable. His initial proposal was very detail oriented and assisted us in approaching all aspects of the project with a good understanding of what would take place. Mark’s crews, from tear down to installation have been on time and easy to work with. They’re efficient and clean up once they have completed their work. Our remodel included not only our kitchen and bathroom, but all of the flooring, baseboards and crown molding in our family room and living room. It’s been a huge project and we couldn’t be more pleased with the result. We have a beautiful modernized downstairs that’s worthy of a professional photo shoot!"
5,"I Found Horizon Construction & Remodeling on line actually for another job but had to shift on the fly when a garage repair issue became more pressing.  Mark came out and reviewed the job with me onsite and followed up with a quote. While not the lowest, I got a good vibe from Mark and chose Horizon for the repair which entailed removing the entire garage floor and much of the underlying soil. The repair looks great and I have received multiple compliments on the completed work. The crews showed up on time and were diligent in their work. Mark and his team are very quick to respond to inquiries which is a big deal to me. I would use them again without hesitation."
5,"I had Horizon install cabinets in my laundry area along with a new sink and also install a ""wet bar"" and media center in my living room.  The quality of the work is excellent and I'm extremely happy. Although my house is small, their work gave it character and everyone that visits comments on how great it looks.  Emma kept me informed the whole way and Mark helped me design everything I wanted.  Thank you!"
5,"We’re writing this review for Horizon Construction & Remolding, Inc. because we found them to be a timely, conscientious and hardworking company that was easy to work with.
The owner Mark Besnos and his staff were very attentive to every detail of our bathroom remodel.
All of the crew members that worked on our bathroom were extremely hard working, always showed up on time and worked long hours to get the job done.
We would highly recommend Horizon Construction for your next construction job.

5,My wife and I are delighted  with our new kitchen.  Horizon did the remodeling in an expeditious and professional  manner.  Their workers were courteous and knowledgeable.  We would highly recommend Horizon to anyone contemplating a remodeling  project.
5,"Horizon Construction completed our remodeling project that involved a full kitchen remodel and structural changes. We could not be more pleased with the results. Mark, Enna, and office staff were highly professional and good communication was made a priority by all. They accommodated all of our change requests.  Mark was mindful that my family was living through the remodel and made efforts to keeping the renovation dust limited to a portion of the house.  The stress of the remodel was lightened by Mark and Enna's empathy and care  as parents of young children as well. Workers sometimes made errors and small damages to areas such as the flooring and walls. Yet with each of these problems, Mark would correct them without question or added charges.  He also took full responsibility for unanticipated problems with the installation of a custom range hood.  In his words: ""I will take care of you.""  In the end, we have a beautiful, high-end kitchen, media room, and more functional laundry room and garage."
4,"Our first home (circa 1951) needed a complete remodel. It had barely been maintained for decades and needed new everything -- plumbing, electrical, HVAC, flooring, windows, doors, etc. We also wanted to update the bathroom, update and expand the kitchen, and remove a load-bearing wall to create an open concept floor plan.

We met with several other shops, and none of them could even envision the finished product or give us a complete estimate. It was a relief when Mike our contractor said at our first meeting, ""Well, the good news is that we can do it all."" And they did. We have been pleased with the overall quality of the work performed, particularly given everything that needed to be done. (The kitchen cabinets, which Horizon supplied, are particularly high quality.) We also appreciated that Mike worked with us to develop a clear pricing estimate, and that other than two unavoidable change orders, the pricing for the job did not change or expand. Horizon allowed us to supply many of our own materials to accommodate our budget as well. (The total price was expensive, but fair, given the short supply of contractors willing and able to do the whole job. We did not have much leverage to negotiate.)

I give Horizon four stars instead of five because we had some communication and timing issues on the job. After we signed the contract in May, the permit submission process was delayed nearly 6 weeks, and while this can be par for the course in some cities, we were not told of the cause for the delay or how the delay was going to impact the project timeline. Instead, we were told and planned on a completion date in early October and were not told until mid-September that the work was actually going to be completed in early November. We had to scramble to extend our temporary lease and find ways to cover the extra costs in our budget.

We also had to push several times for deadlines about what materials needed to be selected and supplied and about payments to be made. We asked for a project timeline, but never received one, and so for several materials, we had to scramble in a day or two to supply them when Mike asked for them ""asap."" Similarly, we offered several times to make progress payments, waited several weeks, and then were asked for large lump sums to cover multiple payments. Both situations caused significant stress.

The lack of a timeline particularly caused some problems when we were selecting a countertop. The pattern we selected was in short supply, and it was not ordered in time for installation before we moved in. To their credit, the owners of Horizon recognized the problem, and they absorbed the cost of a different upgraded countertop, which we appreciated.

And this brings me to my final point -- the owners of Horizon care deeply about their reputation. After they realized some of the timing issues we had experienced, they offered various upgrades to help us get through the rest of the process.

The renovation process is never easy, and frankly, I never want to do it again. But overall, we thought the Horizon crews did a good job."
5,"We were in need of a major master bathroom remodel and were referred to Horizon Construction by a friend who had been extremely please with their master bath remodel.  The owner, Mark, came out on time and gave us many suggestions based on the space we have and an estimate of the cost.  We visited their show room several times to make our selections and were ready to begin.  

The workers all arrived on time and Mark supervised the project from start to finish.  Mark was meticulous in making sure all work was completed to his and our satisfaction.  The result is a beautiful travertine and quartz bathroom that we will enjoy for many years to come.  We highly recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling and will use the company for other remodel projects in the future."
5,"This was my first remodel project and I certainly picked the right company.  A year later I am completely happy with the end result and will use them again.  The schedule was kept and only had 2 change orders which were additional requests from me.  Enna was always in contact with me,  Mark was always available if needed and the trades were all very nice and very professional.  Thank you Horizon Construction .... you have a happy customer!"
4,"I hired Horizon to complete a full remodel of my father’s 3 bedroom/2 bath 1,152 sq. ft. “starter” home (circa 1974) that had never been updated.  Included in the remodel were custom kitchen and bathrooms; new windows and flooring throughout; new A/C and furnace with new ducting; removal of acoustic ceiling; new door (front/fire/closet) replacement throughout; full interior and exterior painting; and updated electrical and plumbing.  The cost:  $95,000.  This amount excludes the cost of all kitchen appliances, vanity/countertops in bathrooms, doors, light fixtures, window coverings, kitchen & bathroom finishes (backsplash tile, cabinet knobs & drawer pulls, sinks, faucets, shower/bath fixtures, mirrors, door handles), new garage door and opener, closet shelving & brackets, as well as required City permits.  

The property was unoccupied throughout the remodel.  Overall, the workmen employed to perform the multitude of tasks involved with this project did a wonderful job!  This was borne out when the house sold 4 days after being listed.  Every showing resulted in comments like “I tried, but I couldn’t find any problems”, “the details were addressed; many remodels miss the mark with the details”, “I’d move in right now if I could!”

As far as the quality of the work goes, I would not hesitate to hire Horizon again.  What I would struggle with, however, are the issues I encountered with project management and administrative matters:

•The project manager I worked with was Mike.  Mike was nice, showed a desire to please his client(s), overall accessible to answer questions, and provided sound and helpful design advice.  Areas where he can improve include writing things down so he won’t forget important issues, reading texts/emails in their entirety to avoid his client’s having to answer questions where information has already been provided in an earlier text/email, and showing more finesse in dealing with a client whose opinion/recollection of events differs with his.  Ultimately, though, Mike’s a good guy and very relatable.
•The front office staff were very pleasant to deal with, and were attentive to issues that arose.  If I had a question, it was usually answered quite promptly.  If I was dissatisfied with something, it was also addressed quite promptly.  Enna (co-owner), Yafa, and Audrey all stand out as being great to work with.  An area that would warrant improvement is the attention to details when it comes to payments.  Client payments should be tracked closely by administration so a client does not have to use their time to provide detailed payment information.

Every construction project will encounter problems and mistakes.  The process has many “moving parts.”  The key factors that helped make this a successful project were that Horizon fulfilled their contractual commitments, took responsibility when mistakes were made, and rectified problems to the satisfaction of their client.

Even after the work was done, and I provided the final sign-off on the project, I encountered an issue that was a result of an understandable mistake on Mike’s behalf.  Enna was so intent on ensuring I was satisfied that she demonstrated her professionalism by rectifying the problem in record time.  She stands by the core philosophy of Horizon Construction & Remodeling to honor their commitment to complete client satisfaction…I appreciate and respect that."
5,"Horizon Construction performed the remodel of  my small master bathroom.  Given the small size, I was expecting any contractor to either price it high or give me second class service.  Horizon did neither.  The price while a bit higher than other bids, was justified by the assignment of a project manager who helped with the design, met me at the home improvement store to pick out the specific tiles and provided exact measurements,  and who provided me with on going supervision of the workers and timely status updates.  

The workers showed up on time and took great care to protect the carpet and the rest of the house.    The work quality was excellent.  I would highly recommend them for the quality of their work.

5,"The project: a kitchen renovation that involved demolishing the old kitchen, building a completely new kitchen in a different location (the old dining area), opening a wall, and building an addition onto the house to add a wet bar

Overall, we had a great experience with Horizon.  They delivered what they said they would, when they said they would, for the price they said it would be.  The work crews were friendly and professional; we were very impressed by their efficiency and the long hours they often worked to complete the project quickly.  As this was our first major renovation, we did sometimes feel some stress about communication (namely knowing when fixtures and decisions were needed from us), but things generally went smoothly.  We are very pleased with the final product and would certainly work with Horizon again."
5,"My wife and I had Horizon remodel two bathrooms at the same time due to a sub floor problem.  The job was performed in a professional ,manner and actually was complete a week early.   The project manager was very professional and assisted us at every step.  Bottom line, I would use this contractor again when the next project arises.  Months after, we required some minor followup repairs and contacted Horizon.  Michael Reppo, the project manager, responded almost immediately.  He came out and inspected and set up the days the crews were to come out and repair.  Really appreciated the prompt and helpful ""AFTER SERVICE"" care given to my wife and I."
5,"This is our 2nd project with Horizon.  First was an awesome kitchen/family room remodel.  This time they did a bathroom remodel, and porcelain tile flooring (living, dining, entry, hall, bath, laundry).  Mark (owner) provided a detailed estimate of cost as well as telling us what our responsibilities were.  There were NO surprise costs.  Mark hires skilled workers (painter, electrician, tile guy, plumber...) who are always on time and polite (no loud talk or radios), able to communicate with me (I speak only English), do meticulous work, and clean up daily before they leave.  Mark is on site almost every day to oversee the quality of work.  Mark and Enna (his wife) are great to work with and responsive to all my texts and emails.  We are going to use Horizon for our next big project (inside staircase redo and new front door).  It's great to have a company you can trust!"
5,Enna and staff are all very helpful. We had a complete demo and remodel of our Master Bath.  It all came out beautifully and could not be happier.
5,"We knew from our experience that this would be a big project, and it would require patience.We needed to remove a weight bearing wall, and reinforce the foundation in three places. This included installing two massive beams in the ceiling to support the roof! This was a Kitchen REBUILD! This old house had the original 1955 yellow tile and linoleum kitchen. We told Mike, our Project Manager that our Prime Concern was the end result. But we wanted him to be as accurate as possible in estimating the start date, and the length of project--and to be HONEST about the predicted time frame. He said they could start in 2-4 weeks as they were so busy--(a good sign). he predicted it would take 3 months to complete, not including holidays. They began within 2 and 1/2 weeks, And they completed our BEAUTIFUL NEW KITCHEN in exactly 3 calendar months which included holidays and weekends!!! We are very happy with the end result, quality materials, and workmanship!!!"
5,"Horizon did a great job with our master bathroom remodel!  We wanted to update the original master bathroom in our home (approximately 20 years old) and they had great ideas to help us realize our goal of a creating a open and modern space.  Their team was very professional, focused on the details, and executed the plan we developed together.  Everyone including the workers, project manager, and owners did a great job.  Thank you Horizon!"
5,"We hired Horizon Construction to demolish our 1950’s kitchen and construct a brand new one. From the beginning they were up front and professional.  We were overwhelmed with all the many choices with design and color.  Since Horizon Construction has a showroom, Mark and Enna were able to help us create the vision we had for our kitchen.  Once the project was underway, we were updated daily by Enna as to when the workers would be here.  We were grateful for their reliability since we were living in our home during the construction. That made this large project much less stressful.  The workers were trustworthy, courteous and respectful of our property.  Throughout the entire project there were only a few issues, as there would be with any project of this magnitude; Mark and his project manager Tal addressed them immediately.  Horizon Construction was a little more expensive than our other bids but you do get what you pay for.  Our kitchen turned out fantastic!  We love it!!"
2,"They came out to bid the job, but when they gave me a price they said that if I did not sign up with them THAT NIGHT then the price would go up by close to 10%, even if it was the following morning.  I explained that I did not do business that way.  Weeks later I asked if they would honor their original price and they quoted me a price that was 15% higher than the original price."
4,"After years of dreaming about remodeling our kitchen, collecting photos from DIY websites and magazines, I was finally able to convince my husband that our 1967 house needed some updating to accommodate our huge family and our hope of “aging in place”. A simple kitchen project became a more extensive downstairs remodel with a new full bathroom and universal shower. We spent months making detailed drawings and lists incorporating what we wanted it to look like. Being life-long DIYers, we entertained the idea of being an owner/contractor but soon realized that the project would involve many structural changes (moving sewer lines, load bearing walls, etc) as well as extensive knowledge of our city’s building codes. In other words, it was beyond our capabilities. We narrowed our search for a contractor to four based on recommendations from neighbors and reviews on the internet, then received estimates and descriptions of the work to be done. Admittedly, we were shocked when all the estimates were almost double what we were anticipating the work to cost… ahh, the price of naivete! While not the least expensive, Mike Roppo, representing Horizon Construction and Remodeling, was the most thorough, knowledgeable and professional of them all.  
Demo started mid-September, final inspection was in mid-February, almost 6 weeks longer than first estimated. We had some glitches and delays along the way:  additional engineering specs, an additional support post, adding a new sheer wall, etc. More time, more money. We were wisely advised to plan on having a 15-20% cushion for unforeseen expenses. Stuff happens!
Electrical, plumbing, framing, drywall, flooring, tile, cabinets, painting, finish carpentry… the crews were great! They all worked hard, cleaned the job site daily, were respectful, communicative-we couldn’t have asked for more from them. Mike was our go-to project manager every step of the way. His code of quality even exceeded ours! We are so grateful to have had him work with us. Mark Besnos  (owner of Horizon Construction) checked in frequently to make sure the work being done met his high standards as well. Mark’s wife Enna and the office staff (Anna and Carolyn) kept us informed as to the work schedule and who to expect on the job site. They were easy to communicate with and always available to address our questions and concerns.
Bottom line, we love our remodeled home and would recommend Horizon Remodeling and Construction…yes, even to our family members."
5,"Recently, we were looking to completely remodel our 1968 master bathroom and create a comfortable, beautiful and functional retreat.  After reading many reviews and viewing several sites, we contacted Horizon Construction and Remodeling to take on the project.  From the first meeting until the final sign off, we found the team to be completely professional, knowledgeable and trustworthy.  During our initial consultation, Mark took our vision and made a beautiful and workable plan that incorporated the custom cabinets and high-end finishes which were consistent with our preferences.  Those plans were transformed into a stunning and comfortable oasis which we enjoy on a daily basis.  When we had questions, changes, or concerns, they were addressed immediately and always to our satisfaction.  During several inspections, our city inspector commented on the outstanding job the team was doing and the rapid pace at which they were completing projects.  The office would keep us informed regarding the daily schedule and as to which teams would be here.  The workman are all skilled craftsmen which shows in their work.  They were respectful, courteous, and meticulous.  Everyday the workspace and surrounding areas were cleaned methodically, taking great care to protect our hardwood floors. This process was first rate from beginning to end, so much so we will be using them in the future to remodel our kitchen.  Quality work, craftsmanship at the highest level, and a professional team, Horizon Construction and Remodeling are top notch and I would recommend them to everyone whether your project is small or large.  Horizon can do it all.  Thank you Horizon for a job well done!"
1,"I called for appointment after reading reviews:
Met with Horizon on January 12, 2016, at least an hour, will be giving me an estimate
Jan. 23, I called office Mgr. Anna to ask why I had not heard back from them, told he was working on other projects to and she would check with him, ask to be called for update. 
Feb. 20, 2016 I went back into my email and found an email from Michael dated Jan. 25, saying Anna said I had called, it takes long due to my circumstance but said he would have it by Wed. with would be (1-27-16). Today is February 20, 2016 and I have not heard from or received any word from Horizon."
5,"We came to Horizon with a home that was in poor shape and needed not only remodeling, but also major infrastructure repair and updates, such as piping, wiring, A/C and heating, etc.  Horizon was proactive in advising us on design, selection and quality of materials, forthcoming with responses to our questions and concerns.  I am not what you'd call an ""easy"" customer, but Horizon was very responsive in resolving the issues that inevitably come up with any project of this scope.  They have also shown that they are willing to follow up on post-project touch-ups, etc; they are determined that we be fully satisfied with the project. 

We are extremely happy in our ""new"" home (it IS like new to us,) and gladly recommend them.  The project was very expensive, due to the damage and poor maintenance accruing over many years, and Horizon was also helpful in assisting us to find financing when our other sources were VERY slow and unhelpful in responding."
4,"Our kitchen was gross. A DIY job by the previous owner on the cheap. Nasty drawers and cabinets that would shed wood particles all over our plates. A poorly placed dishwasher that couldn't open all the way made it completely useless. It needed to go. 

We researched contractors for over 6 months. Interviewed and got bids from 4. Horizon was the most expensive, which was a concern for us - but their strong reviews, experience and overall professionalism gave us peace of mind that was worth the additional cost. 

They worked with our budget to put together a plan that met our needs. After signing with them there were some unexpected things that came up. A few change orders, and our project manager left the company just as we started demo... But throughout, Mark and Enna were helpful and responsive.  

The foreman Effy and his whole crew were great to work with and they made a point to leave the job site neat and tidy at the end of the day.

This was our first major remodel and we're not the most laid back folks... So it was stressful. Despite all of our little worries along the way, Horizon ultimately came through and gave us the beautiful kitchen that we had been dreaming of."
4,"My kitchen project involved completely demolishing my old kitchen and making a brand new one. This also involved removing a load-bearing post and widening the opening to my living room. When I first spoke with Horizon, I had no idea what I wanted to do with the space, other than removing the load-bearing post and opening the doorway. The first time I met with the Project Manager, he showed me pictures of other kitchens, measured my existing kitchen, and sketched out some ideas of how the space could be redone. I appreciated the time he took to help develop how the new space would look. As with any construction project, there were a couple minor delays, and that’s to be expected. As a result, the project took a bit longer to complete than anticipated. What resulted was a beautiful, functional, new kitchen and I am so happy with the outcome. While the Project Manager that I had initially worked with left the company mid-project, the work continued to be carried out as planned. I only met Mark one time toward the latter part of the project, but was told that he had been at my home regularly throughout the project. Enna was my e-mail angel; always replying in a timely manner to my questions and concerns. The foreman that worked at my house was very helpful and kept in communication with me. I love my new kitchen and look forward to many years of enjoyment with family and friends. I would use Horizon again for future home improvement projects."
5,"Hi Enna!Mark was here this morning to check out our Bathroom and we are sad we missed him!  We wanted to give him a great big thank you and a hug!  Please tell him thanks from us!  Thanks to you too Enna, Caroline, Anna, Sam and your whole crew!  You all have made this experience very pleasant!  All of you have been kind, considerate and made us feel like we mattered!  We appreciate you!We absolutely love our bathroom!  It's beautiful and works so much better for us!  I have been posting pictures and telling friends and family about the whole experience!  I have one lady who may redo her bathrooms and another today that asked for your name to give to her daughter!  We will continue to brag about you and our bathroom!Thank you again!Marlene and Dennis Baker"
5,"This was the fourth project that Horizon Construction has done for us. They did a complete remodel of our kitchen, both bathrooms, and removed popcorn ceilings and repainted two family rooms. This project involved removing a chimney that sat perpendicular from the wall in the middle of our family room. They did the complete demo in one day, sealing off the room with plastic to cut down on dust as much as they could. Very impressed! They had to patch the roof, patch the ceiling, and the wall. The very creative part was what to do with the floor area where the chimney base had been. The tile on the floor surrounding the area was discontinued so we were able to find a similar tile that their amazing tile guy laid at a diagonal and it looks fantastic!!! As I have always stated before, Horizon is not perfect (let me know if you do find a contractor who does perfect work the very first time!!). But they will always make sure you are completely satisfied with the work before leaving, no matter what. I respect that and that is why they have come back to do work at our house four times!!!"
5,"Master Bath Remodel.  This is the third time we hired Horizon.  We were very happy with their previous work (a kitchen remodel and replacing all the crown molding and baseboards throughout the house) so we had no hesitation in hiring them again.   Mark came over and we talked through our wish list for the bathroom remodel.  He offered useful suggestions and came back to us quickly with a detail plan and a price.  Mark met with us twice at the tile store to help us make our selections.  The whole project then proceeded very smoothly.  Enna was quite helpful along the way in keeping us up to date and on top of all the decisions that had to be made.  Workers were there every day and they were all well-skilled, polite and neat.  There were a few issues that came up, but Mark and Enna and the workers always heard our concerns and made sure that everything was always completed to our complete satisfaction.   The bathroom turned out beautifully with clean lines and gorgeous materials, just like we dreamed of."
5,"Description Of Work: 

Initially called them for some upstairs floor repair, tile and carpet replacement throughout house, including replacement of baseboards. Upon removal of carpet, found some cracks indicative of foundation damage.  City engineer required geologic report which contractor arranged for, and contractor worked with city to settle on required remediation, (significant concrete footing additions and drainage) which was responsible for 2/3 of total cost. Contractor also replaced stair banister and rail and installed new front door.


Member Comments: 


The project timeline was extended significantly by the discovery of the need for foundation work and the involvement of the City in that process.  Otherwise, all the work of the contractor was excellent, timely and efficient.  Every day the worksite was left clean and the house was livable through entire process.  Workers were very skilled and eager to please and did excellent work. We had purchased new lighting for the house and they arranged for an electrician to do the installation for us.

Omri, the project manager, was excellent at keeping us apprised of scheduled work times and visits, and with suggestions or variations of our ideas to enhance the house further. The business owner, Mark, was on site from time to time, including at the foundation specialist's initial visit. Occasionally additional work was recommended, generally for completion of the remodeling, or as recommended for long term benefit.

Horizon's quality of work is excellent, they are honest, and the price of the work is fair. I can not overstate my satisfaction with my relationship with them."
5,"My husband and I started our remodeling journey in February 2015. At first we wanted to just update our kitchen. But after a while we decided to expand the project and remove the walls between the kitchen, dining room and family room and create one big open space. We worked with a construction company for more than 3 months. We met with them many times and finally we decided they were not up to the task. 
My husband found Horizon from the Angie’s list and he setup an appointment.  When Mark came to our house he explained the process to us. They would do the the plans, get them approved  by the city and then we could use him for construction or go with another companies. He gave us a reasonable price for the drawings. He also showed us many pictures from different projects he had worked on. Projects in which he had moved or removed walls. That was important to me. Horizon move very quickly and we had  approved plans in less than 3 weeks. Our project was not just upgrading rooms. There was serious structural change we needed to do. Removing all 3 load bearing walls and adding 2 huge beams across the house. It still scares me when I think about it. 
The construction project was supposed to take 3 months. The crews were in our house almost every day. And they worked really hard. The job site was kept clean and organized. We had a payment chart so we paid each piece after it was done. Demolition, material, footers, etc. I never forget the day we came home after a 3 day trip and saw the walls completely gone, beams up there and for the first time we could see our new space. It was very exciting. There were no big surprises but a few issues did come up but Mark and his team explained them and we work through them easily. Mark responded to all of our concerns and questions and was  always available.
The project finished just under 3 months and we are extremely happy with the result and experience. Mark and his team are true professionals. I also want to add that Enna was very helpful in the entire process keeping us up-to-date. Horizon made this project look easy. But I know it was not. They basically took our 1970 old, outdated and dark house and brought it to year 2015 making it look bright and open. Thank you Horizon Construction"
5,"We chose Horizon Construction for  a master bathroom remodel. The company was very professional, the project manager was extremely organized. Workers showed up each day when scheduled and left everything clean at the end of the day. The owner always did a final inspection. The final product was beautiful! We will definitely use them again for the next remodel."
5,"The project went smoothly from beginning to end.  Omri, the project manager, was very helpful and patient in helping choose the tile and fixtures for the bathroom.  Tal and his crew were very good at their jobs, whether it be the demo or the plumbing or tiling. Enna in the office kept us informed of the schedule which was very helpful.  The end result is a beautiful bathroom that we love!  Thank you Horizon!"
5,"Not many people would describe a kitchen renovation as a pleasant experience, but my husband and I would. 

Ours is a 50s tract home, and we wanted to update the small kitchen without it looking out of synch with the rest of the house, what we like to call ""mid century modest,"" AND we wanted to incorporate our vintage white Wedgewood range. We're a bit eclectic in our taste and were looking for someone who ""got"" our vision...kind of mid century without the kitsch or the ultra moderne style, with maybe a little Craftsman thrown in for good measure. It was a challenge to find that someone in our area.

We initially got quotes from two other contractors who were willing to do what we thought we wanted. When we met with our third candidate, Mark Besnos of Horizon Construction & Remodeling, and described our desire to, for instance, relocate the sink, Mark said ""You don't want to do that."" At first we were taken aback, then saw the wisdom when he explained why moving the sink would be a big mistake. He was absolutely right, and we hired him on the spot.

From Day 1 we were impressed by the steady communication with the office (run by his lovely wife, Enna) letting us know what to expect from day to day and addressing any questions or concerns we might have. We were equally impressed by the attention to detail and overall craftsmanship performed by each member of Mark's crew: every single detail was honed to perfection...cabinetry, floor tile, backsplash, paint, installations, even cleanup. A few changes were accommodated without undue stress or expense. 

We did have one unfortunate surprise when the load-bearing wall with the pass-through between the dining area and kitchen turned out to need reinforcement due to the work of the ""handyman"" who had owned the house before us. He had actually cut the support beams to create the pass-through, left them dangling, and then just closed up the wall. It's a miracle the house didn't fall down during an earthquake! So even though the fix meant a little more money than we anticipated, it was absolutely necessary and we now have a safer, more stable home. And the pass-through looks stunning! 

I did want to mention that the Caesarstone ""Concrete"" countertop is NOT suitable for a family with kids as it shows every handprint and drip. I failed to read the caveat on the Caesarstone Care & Maintenance page that clearly states: ""Please understand that Honed, Concrete and Motivo™ finishes will require more daily maintenance than our polished finishes. Since there is more exposed surface area with these finishes, metal marks, fingerprints and other signs of daily living will show on these materials."" Bottom line: I've become a bit obsessive with a micro fiber towel always at hand.

Horizon is a small, family-owned business run by and staffed by kind, caring, and competent professionals each of whom goes the extra mile to provide complete customer satisfaction. Even though Mark had to leave the country unexpectedly, the job stayed on track during his absence and was finished within the expected timeframe. 

It's no wonder Horizon has so many positive reviews, and we will definitely be using them again when we're ready to tackle our outdated bathrooms."
5,"We had no intention of redoing our 58-year-old kitchen (we had put up with it for so long) until Anna from Horizon called one day.  I never appreciate sales calls, but Anna was so pleasant that I scheduled a consultation with Mark.  He was very thorough and helpful.  Before we knew it, our kitchen was being completely renovated.  Everyone at Horizon was very patient with us as we chose materials and I invariably worried about everything!  Mark and Enna kept reassuring me that it would all be fine, and they would take care of everything.  And they did!  They redid our kitchen and pantry from top to bottom.  They also replaced the floor in the entry and guest bathroom, and replaced all the door and floor moldings.  Their workers were skilled, very polite and respectful, and cleaned up after themselves every afternoon before they left.  The finished kitchen is gorgeous!  Exactly what I wanted.....simple, clean, and warm!  It is a perfect kitchen for this house.  Any issues, large or small, that arose were taken care of to our satisfaction. Mark, Enna and the rest of their office and construction crew were wonderful.  I'm actually going to miss them!  I would not hesitate to recommend them, and I will not hesitate to call them for future projects."
5,"We are very pleased with our new master bathroom! It is gorgeous! The bathroom was gutted and Horizon replaced the tiled walk-in shower and bathroom floor, installed a custom vanity and two huge framed mirrors, and all new plumbing and electrical fixtures. They also scraped, textured and painted our master bedroom ceiling. Mark was creative in helping us with design ideas and made sure all the details that we envisioned were taken care of to our satisfaction. Enna was in the office and guided us through the process, answering any questions or concerns we had along the way. She was knowledgeable herself, or she referred our questions to Mark or Tal, our foreman. Communication was quick and constant...either by email or phone. All the people who worked on our project were courteous, competent, and kept our home as clean as possible, tidying up each day before leaving. Our project started on time and finished on time, with people working every day. We always felt we were in very good hands. With anyone else we might have had a nice bathroom, but with Horizon we have a BEAUTIFUL bathroom!"
5,"Services provided: Bathroom remodels, bathroom addition, tongue-in-groove ceiling, built-in cabinetry  around fireplace, pergola, fencing. 
My husband and I are extremely happy with the work performed by Horizon Construction. All the built-ins and cabinetry work are beautiful. The bathrooms are the envy of our friends and neighbors. Every team of construction specialists that came into our house took great pride in their work. And outside, the pergola and new fencing are beautiful as well. Indeed, our house could be featured as a 'before and after' transformation in a designer magazine. With a project of this magnitude, there are bound to be surprises behind the walls. What was so great about Horizon was that they stepped up to the plate and went above and beyond to resolve every issue. Customer service is not just lip service with them, they take it to heart. Their reputation as a premier remodeler is very important to them. Our project manager, Omri Nave, was professional and extremely responsive, as was Enna Eskin in the office. 
As a side note I should add that we were originally going with another contractor recommended by friends, but after many weeks and still no firm bid from that contractor, I searched for a contractor on Angie's List.  Omri from Horizon came out immediately and met with my husband at the house we had just purchased (I was in Arizona at the time). Omri worked until very late that night to prepare the detailed bid, and my husband signed on the dotted line without hesitation.
It is never easy to go through a remodel project of this size, especially while you are living in the house. But we are so grateful to the Horizon team for their professionalism and dedication to customer satisfaction. What few issues came up were resolved quickly and without hassle. We would recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling without reservation."
5,"I have never written a review about any company before mainly because I have never worked with a company that delivered what it promised.  That ended when we contracted Horizon Construction and Remodeling. Not only was the work done beautifully but was finished within the timeline we set, and they delivered as promised.
I can't say enough about this company.  Mark Besnos and his crew are without a doubt the best contractor and professionals we have ever worked with.  When we first met with Mark we knew he was the right guy.  He works within your budget and has so many great ideas that help with your design decision making.   Also, behind every successful company there is a very professional office staff.  Enna Eskin makes sure that all the paper work is done and expedited on time.  She's great to work with and is there to answer any questions you might have.  You feel like family with this company because they take such good care of you.  
Mark oversees every aspect of the project himself. He arrived everyday before and after his workers finished their work and walked through the project and inspected it.  If something didn't meet his approval he would tag it and have them redo it.  He is a perfectionist and it shows when the project is done.  His crew cleaned up every night after they finished their work and left us with a clean house to live in and that was not an easy task to do.  We remodeled out Master Bath, put new granite and a backsplash in the kitchen, installed wood floors throughout the house, and a beautiful new staircase.
If you are looking for the Rolls Royce of Contractors, don't look any further.  Horizon Construction and Remodeling is the company for you want.  You won't be disappointed."
4,"When we bought our home, we knew we wanted to take on a massive remodel/upgrade. We interviewed and gathered estimates from four Southern California general contractors, all of them coming in with high ratings and reviews from Houzz, Yelp, Angie’s List and BBB. Horizon did not come in the lowest bidder, however, their professionalism, conduct of business, their interaction with their clients and attention to detail was what made them stand out from the others. 

Undergoing a project as big as ours (a complete remodel of master bath, all new windows and doors, new flooring throughout the house, a complete new stair case, opening up a room, blowing out wall, painting the whole interior, changing out hardware, adding a pergola and incorporating a 15' bi-fold door) there are going to be bumps and unforeseen turns in the road. 

From relocating an outlet for daily convenience to installing a new header beam to comply with city permitting, no task was too small for Horizon the scope of our remodeling project. Their team of designers and contractors walked us through picking out our materials, gave us experienced advice and listened to our dream home vision. What we originally though we wanted or thought about forgoing, Horizon helped us plan and design around our budget and keep the big picture in perspective. At the end of the six-month project we were very impressed with how Horizon handed all the different types of issues and challenges that arouse. 

This house is our ""20 year home"" where will be raising our children, having family gatherings and hosting countless friends. We have now lived the home for three months (construction free) and we are very happy with the quality of service and out come of our remodel done by the team at Horizon Construction and Remodel."
5,"I hired Horizon for an excavation and construction project for a second living unit on my property. They made the whole process so smooth. Omer, the project manager and designer, was extremely helpful. I felt like I was his only priority. He made the hardest stage of my project so easy. I have actually gained a friend from the process that we went through and him making it so enjoyable. There was not a single struggle even in the inevitable unforeseen obstacles. He made them dissolve. In a way, I want to have another project just so I can work with them all over again."
5,"Working with Mark and Enna from Horizon Construction and Remodeling was a great experience.  They were professional, punctual, precise, and communicative.  Each day work was performed, their workers made sure to leave as little impact or disturbance in the area.  The work done is of high quality - they were able to transform our bathroom out of the 1960s into something modern, clean, and functional.  We were in constant communication via text/phone/email.  They were very patient when we were picking out our cabinet colors - leaving us samples to ensure that we got the exact color and style we wanted.  And of the three contractors we bid the job out to, there price was very reasonable.  I appreciated the personal touch they add to their service - always making sure that we were satisfied with each step of the process.  We will definitely be calling Mark and Enna again when it comes time to get our kitchen out of the 60s."
5,"The project included ceiling repair and remodeling in entry hall, dining room and living room.  The process was easy, efficient, and included myself throughout the steps.  Pricing was fair, timing was accommodating, and I am most pleased with the results.  Omer Barel was terrific and made me feel that I was in most capable, confident hands.  Overall, a good experience, and I would recommend them to anyone."
5,"This is the kitchen my wife has been waiting for since we bought our house 16 years ago.  She loves the final product!  To be honest, we were not planning on spending this much on our kitchen remodel; however, we chose Horizon based on over 100 reviews and our experiences with other contractors in the past.  So, based on the reviews, we knew we were going to spend more money than the average kitchen remodel.  Having dealt with several projects over the years, I also was aware we were going to go over budget along with having some challenges along the way.  We did have a couple of issues that looked like they were going to go sideways, but Horizon listened to and took care of those issues to the best of their ability each time--and, to good effect.  I spent the most time communicating with Enna--almost always over the phone or by E-mail--and found her easy to work with.  I had read reviews that said some things about Enna being difficult to get along with, but I did not find that to be the case.  Keep in mind, all of the reviews that had those comments in them did not actually have work done by Horizon.  Enna was there to help solve a couple of problems by making certain one of her crew got to our house, by coming to our house herself, or by, for example, crediting us $741 for the ceiling drywall replacement [because I thought we did not need to replace it].  There were several Horizon employees that helped the remodeling experience [often stressful] more tolerable.  Horizon arranged to have a Porta-Potty outside our house so the workers would not have to use our bathrooms.  They also arranged the appointments with the city for the permit inspections.  There were some communication problems at times; however, I soon learned that going straight to Enna was the best way to solve any problems that cropped up.  If anyone wonders why I rated Horizon a ""B"" for price I have a simple answer:  their are not the low-end bid--they are likely closer to the higher-end bid.  But, you get what you pay for.  So, the ""B"" is to give prospective customers a heads-up that you ought to plan accordingly.  That said, we chose an expensive (beautiful) piece of granite, had special space-saving aspects added to our cabinets, glass-tile backsplash, under-counter lighting, travertine tile floor, and more.  There were no significant surprises except . . . WE REALLY LOVE OUR NEW KITCHEN!  However, I would say that was more of an expectation than a surprise."
5,"Due to a water leak issue, I had to remodel my kitchen and part of the family room.  After many interviews and careful consideration I selected Horizon Construction and Remodeling who, in addition, was highly rated by customers on Angie’s list.  It proved to be a very good decision!  Mr. Ormi Nave was my Project Manager whose expertise guided me through design, style and material selections.  The cabinet maker, electrician, plumber, painter/drywall, tile installer were all excellent at their craft!  Upper management also reviewed on-site work excellence and progression.  The Horizon team maintained a high level of professionalism and integrity throughout the entire project.   I highly recommend Horizon for your next project!"
5,"Our project consisted of a complete kitchen remodel (including soffit removal and fireplace facelift) along with new flooring and cabinets in the bathroom and laundry room.  We also replaced the flooring in the entry way as well as the coat closet and linen cabinet.    Horizon Construction was not the least or most expensive quote we gathered.  One deciding factor for us was that Mark offered ideas and suggestions during the quoting process.  We had a general concept that we were shooting for but this was our first kitchen remodel so we were also looking for expert advice on layout, materials and design.  Response time to questions and change orders was quick.  As with any work in an older home, surprises occurred and adjustments were made throughout the project which affected the timeline and cost.  Mark walked us through these obstacles as he knew we were detail oriented.  We did experience some discrepancies in what was agreed upon with Mark and what was executed by the crew.  These mistakes were all quickly fixed at no additional cost to us (other than time lost).  We had an assigned foreman for some of the trades but ultimately Mark acted as our main point of contact for everything.  The crew was professional, hard-working and respectful.  We were not pleased with the semi-custom cabinet installers.  Horizon’s custom cabinet maker who worked on some of our other pieces was much better with a higher quality product.   Final cabinet details were fixed and completed in a timely manner by him.  Overall, we were very pleased with the final results!"
5,"Kitchen Remodel.
Horizon just completed a gut rehab remodel of our kitchen (which included removing a wall) and we were very pleased with the whole process. This was our first remodeling project and we didn't quite know what to expect going into it. We worked primarily with Omri who did an absolutely wonderful job keeping everything on track and helping us each step of the way. He truly went above and beyond to ensure that our needs were met and that we were happy with the end result. The remodel was completed in a timely manner and each of the work crews that came in were courteous, professional and cleaned everything up at the end of each day. Another plus for us was that Horizon was all inclusive. We didn't have to choose a separate place to buy/install the cabinets from and another for the counters, etc. They handle everything which makes it so much easier!"
5,"Horizon Construction did an incredible job on our kitchen from day one!  Omri and Mark have been there each step of the way with great ideas and suggestions and then they bring fantastic workers in to make them a reality.  From countertops to cabinets to floors and plumbing they have the best of the best working for them.  We had a kitchen wall that needed to be removed and needless to say my wife and I were worried about tearing our house apart!  Horizon managed the process with precision and now the house looks like it was originally built without that wall. I can't say enough good things about this team - they are professional, diligent, responsible, fairly priced and they always do what they say they are going to do.  We have had a couple of issues along the way but Horizon demonstrated their commitment to customer service each time something came up.  They take responsibility and fix issues as they arise without any questions.  I would highly recommend Horizon to friends and family and encourage anyone considering a remodel to use them."
5,"Removed bathtub in master suite and constructed a walk-in shower, added a second water line to accommodate the shower heads, constructed a pocket door to separate the bedroom from the dressing room.  Electrical included led lights in my home office and other electrical work,  installed new faucets in the kitchen and 3 bathrooms and painted...

I chose Horizon Construction and Remodeling (HCR) because of their excellent presentation and fabulous reputation on Angie’s List. This was a wise decision because HCR proved to be an ethical, caring and efficient company. My original remodeling job was to remove the bathtub in the master suite and install a walk-in shower. During the remodeling, I added additional electrical, plumbing changes and repairs to my home. The HCR crew held my hands throughout the whole process. The office staff called me frequently to check how I was doing and to make sure everything was going okay.  The workers, in my home, were hardworking, fast and clean. There were a couple of hiccups with the job but I was very impressed with the prompt, same day, actions taken to correct any problems. In addition, all inspections were passed on first try. The price was reasonable for all of the work done and some things were not even charged. I whole heartedly recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling and I will call them again for my next remodeling project.

5,"Our contractor was Mark Besnos.  Mark is definitely who you want doing your remodeling.  Mark is fastidious.  His attention to detail was unbelievable.  As picky as he is, I wouldn't want to be his wife.  As with any job, there were things that needed tweaking.  Mark made sure everything was absolutely perfect.  We had an issue with the stainless steel tiles for the backsplash.  After installing it was obvious that some of the tiles had a different finish (brushed finish instead of shiny finish).  Mark had the tile company come to the house.  He made sure the issue was fixed.  His office staff, Enna, and Anna, were terrific.  There was never a time when I called that I didn't get a hold of Mark, Enna, or Anna.  The best part, everyone who has come to see the kitchen, even all the subcontractors, complimented us on the kitchen.  It should be on the cover of Better Homes & Gardens.  Sherry."
5,"There are already the well-acknowledged passages associated with life; birth, marriage, divorce, graduation, the new job. I’d like to add one more—remodeling.

The decision to embark upon the renovation path, in most cases, involves entering into a relationship with a contractor. Selecting one, in many respects, is only slightly less important than say choosing a spouse or deciding to have children. Remodeling your home can be a journey filled with uncertainty, havoc and frustration as you work toward the beautiful surroundings you envisioned those many months earlier. As the old knight who guarded the room of chalices in a scene from the movie, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, mused, “Choose wisely.” 

Fortunately, we did when we contracted with Mark of Horizon Construction. You want your contractor to be competent, trustworthy, and reliable. Mark was all of these and more. 

Mark takes a personal interest in his work. He is on the site much of the time ensuring that his workers are doing their best. When things go wrong, he makes sure they get fixed. Like any relationship, there will be disagreements or misunderstandings, but Mark handled them in a professional and sincere manner. The bottom line here is that Mark wants his customers to be happy.

I could relate several episodes of Mark’s commitment to customer satisfaction, but the one that meant the most to us was when we had a sewer line back up into the house (no fault of Mark’s). Out of panic, I called Mark and he came out immediately and with his foreman worked on clearing the line. He didn’t have to do that. He could have told us to call a plumber and gone back to what he was doing.

I highly recommend Horizon Construction and Mark as your choice for your remodel project. You will have chosen wisely."
4,"My initial experience with Enna when I first called to set up an appointment was very professional and pleasant. We set up an appointment to meet with Mark, the GC, within 2 weeks of the call. Mark was professional, listened well to what we had in mind, augmented these visions with his own excellent design ideas, and made us feel very confident at the first meeting that Horizon was likely the best choice for us. After meeting with several other GCs over the next few weeks, Horizon was in our top 3 finalists, and we made the choice to move forward with them based on our feelings of confidence that they really understood what we wanted to do. Horizon was not the lowest bidder, nor were they the highest.
 After confirming with Mark our choice to move forward with Horizon, we met with him again to go over in more detail the project scope and timeline and to sign paperwork for the plan development. The initial project timeline was identified as 10-12 weeks. Soon after this meeting, he swiftly had plans drawn up for the architectural changes to our kitchen and living room and submitted them for approval. Expecting approval to take several weeks, Mark suggested we start working on the master bathroom remodel so as not to lose momentum. During Master Bath demolition, Mark identified some unanticipated framing work after the walls were stripped. Although I was not expecting this, we compromised on the cost of addressing this work, which set the tone for addressing unexpected work going forward. Work on the Master Bath went longer than expected based on some changes to scope as well as some permit hang-ups, but the finished product was exactly what we wanted.
 Approval of the Kitchen\Living Room plans came back quicker than expected (in a few days as opposed to weeks), and work on the kitchen and living room commenced and ran concurrent with the work on the master bathroom. This work involved removing walls between the galley kitchen, the den/4th bedroom, the living room and the dining area with the ultimate design goal being a great room spanning all of these areas. Due to removing load-bearing walls, support beams had to be installed in the attic and 6 foot deep underpinnings had to be dug and placed in a several areas. Although the inside of our house was unrecognizable, the work proceeded on schedule for the most part. During the project, we did make some adjustments to overall scope (not changing planned work, just adding new work to overall scope, e.g., originally we had no intention of touching the fireplace, or any of the bedrooms; we made some decisions midstream to have Horizon redo the fireplace
 and floor and paint all of the bedrooms based upon design ideas from Mark). Change management on these items (and other items) was handled well by Enna. After the Master Bathroom completed, Horizon started on the guest bathroom remodel, which involved the following:

 > Removal of HVAC unit from closet adjacent to the bathroom.
 > Demolition of walls between HVAC closet, bathroom, and adjacent coat closet.
 > Installation of new HVAC unit in the attic.

 Utilizing the square footage from the HVAC closet and the coat closet effectively doubled the square footage of the guest bathroom allowing us to convert it into a full bath with double vanity (from a ¾ bath). This was the last aspect of the project to complete.Considering that we lived in the house through the project (with the exception of 3 non-continuous weeks for vacation), we were eager to see the project complete, and we are extremely happy with the results. Horizon saw the vision we had for transforming the interior of our 55 year old ranch style house into something more modern and beautiful, and they executed on it.
 The only negative thing I feel compelled to note is that the crew was not considerate about keeping the work site clean: Paint brushes were rinsed out in the plants in the front yard; razors, cuttings from wood, discarded pieces of wire, food wrappings, etc continually littered my front yard and driveway. I asked Mark and Enna to address with their crew at least two times, however it didn't fix the situation and I ultimately ended up cleaning up after the crew. This may seem petty or perhaps I am naïve about a project of this magnitude, but it made me feel disrespected as a customer for my concerns about this to go effectively ignored.
 Lastly I have to say that, Horizon Construction (Mark, Enna and their whole crew) we're extremely friendly and nice throughout the entirety of the project. Never once did I second guess my choice. By the end of the project, I still felt comfortable that we had made the best choice. Since the completion of the project, Horizon has cheerfully addressed any issues that have come up."
5,"We hired Mark and his team to come and install Marble flooring in our formal dining/living room. They were quick, efficient and very clean. He was very thorough about what the layout was going to look like, making sure to ask if I had any changes to the design. It came out looking gorgeous. Enna was also very personable and thorough. Confirmations for everything was emailed and discussed so there were no ""surprises"" or hiccups and misunderstandings. Overall they did a great job."
5,"We have been working with Horizon Construction for many years now. Their projects are beautiful and we are proud to be a part of it. They are detail oriented and give close attention to every aspect of their work. Enna & Mark have been a pleasure to work with, easy going and pleasant .

5,"When we first met Mark Besnos (owner) at our house, he asked a lot of questions, offered suggestions, and was not at all afraid to offer his opinion when he thought we were wrong (this can be off-putting I suppose, except after you work with Mark for a while you will come to appreciate that he really knows what he is doing and you should listen to him!).  Of the five bids we received for this work, Mark's was by far the most detailed and the only one that covered all of the details we discussed.  Not the cheapest bid by far, but when I went back and looked at the holes in the other bids I had no doubt they would have change ordered us to death and I would have ended up spending the same or more likely more.

The work started promptly and once started stayed pretty much on schedule throughout.  Enna always kept us informed when things were going to be done, so there were never any major surprises.  There were problems along the way as there always are in remodeling, and this is where Horizon really shines in my opinion - Mark always said ""Don't worry, we will take care of it"", and they always did.  Every time.  If you have had remodel work done before you know how rare this is.  It's the way a business should be run, unfortunately many contractors don't seem to get it.

We are extremely pleased with the work they did.  In particular, our master bath which has all new cabinetry, onyx counter, travertine floors and shower walls, frameless glass shower and rainfall shower are spectacular.  I remark to my wife when I get out of the shower in the morning that I feel like I'm staying at the Ritz Carlton! 

Thanks Mark and Enna.  You guys are great!"
5,"We have working with Horizon for many years, they give every customer personalized attention and they have an eye for detail work. They are experts in the area of remodeling with an eye for fresh ideas in the design field. Trusted reliable service, It doesn't get any better in customer service!"
5,"The remodeling included the demolition and reconstruction of 2 bathrooms. It included converting the guest bath to a walk-in shower with tile and a frameless glass enclosure. The job included replacing the vanities, countertops, installing porcelain tile throughout, new bathtub installed in the master bath, changes to the plumbing and all new fixtures including sinks, exhaust fans, and lighting. 
We selected Horizon Construction & Remodeling because of the good ratings they received from customers who had work done by them. The cost was higher than some other quotes I received but I was concerned about the quality of the workmanship and considered the customer satisfaction ratings Horizon received from their customers. As it turned out, the work was completed on time, within budget and the quality of the work was excellent. We are very satisfied with how everything turned out. As in any project, issues arise but they were quickly resolved with no excuses. Mark inspected the work as it progressed and Enna communicated with us every step of the way so there were no surprises. They got a building permit from the City of Huntington Beach for the remodeling as we requested and we had no problems passing any phase of the inspection process. We would recommend them to our friends."
5,"Added 215 sq.ft. to Master Bedroom including enlarged and remodeled Master Bathroom, siting area, and walk-in closet.
Member Comments: 
This was the second project we've contracted with Horizon (first was a kitchen remodel in 2009). Work was completed on schedule, within budget, and met all our expectations. Horizon kept us apprised of the progress by email (e.g. ""Tomorrow they will install the counter top""). They stayed on the job until every item on our ""Punch List"" had been addressed to our satisfaction. Mark and Enna are a very nice couple and are a joy to work with. When unforeseen problems arise (and they always do), Enna's voice over the phone is very calming and reassuring and indeed all problems were resolved. Mark walks through the project frequently and will spot items that don't meet his expectations and see that they are corrected without us having to say a word.
We will definitely use them again for our next project."
5,"Horizon had to take down two walls and put In a beam to create our open layout kitchen. It was a huge job and we took three bids. But the other two bids wouldn't take out the walls, and we didn't want to settle. Mark said yes right away and brought an engineer who gave the okay. Every change easy passed by us for approval and the work was done very well. Issues we had after the remodel were handled. Someone visiting said it looked like it was always there, but my husband and I know what a huge transformation this kitchen was to our house and our lives. Enna was a great lifeline through the whole project which was completed before the estimated time."
5,"Complete remodel of kitchen, demo of old exterior concrete stone and fireplace. Replaced with stack stone. Installation of wood flooring. 


We went through several contractors (6 to be exact) before we found the right one. From the moment we called Horizon Construction, Enna made use feel very comfortable. We explained to Enna what we wanted and what we were looking for. She stated that Mark Besnos would be out to see us and see what he can do. Mark who is the owner and designer gave us a very beautiful vision of what our kitchen would look like. We felt at ease with Mark and fell in love with his ideas. We have finally found our contractor. We only had signed a contract with Horizon to remodel our kitchen but asked mark what he could also do with the exterior of the house and gave us another beautiful vision. He recommended to remove the old concrete stone around the house and by the fireplace and replace it with stack stone. The final out come is amazing. We also wanted to remove the old carpet and install wood flooring and gave him the job as well and they did an excellent job of installing our wood flooring. Our overall experience with the Horizon Construction crew was very good. The crew was very polite, on time, and cleaned up after them selves at the end of the work day. Mark and his foreman Elly were there almost everyday to ensure that the projects were getting done as we have specified and would correct any issues we had with some of the installations. Given the amount of time we gave Horizon Construction they finished the job as specified and did a beautiful job. We have gotten many, many compliments on our house and can only thank Mark, Enna, Elly and the Horizon Construction crew for all there hard work and for making our experience and great one."
5,"Just want to say that we are extremely happy with the kitchen remodel that Horizon Construction completed for us. Our home was built in the late 1940s and was really showing its age. We wanted to have an open floor plan that incorporated the kitchen, dining room and living room. We had some ideas and a budget for what we were willing to spend. Mark took our ideas and make them come to life! He has an eye for design and style and a commitment to quality and detail. He and Enna are both committed to making sure their clients are satisfied and happy.
We took out a load bearing wall between the old kitchen and living room and now have a wonderful large room. This was the second kitchen remodel I have lived through and this one was definitely the best. Mark said he would be finished in 9 weeks and he was! Their crew worked Monday through Friday and showed up every day.  Enna called daily to keep us up to date, making sure we had appliances and spec sheets ready for the crew and making sure all our questions were answered. 
Mark was at the house every morning to direct the crew and attend to any details. He made sure that everything that we couldn’t see was done correctly as well as attending to details like overhead lamp and outlet placement and overall design functionality and appearance. Mark had the placement of the lamp over our dining table changed several times (without our knowing) until he was satisfied that it would be in the right place – and it was!
The crew was absolutely great. They arrived at about the same time every morning, went right to work but were always patient and answered any questions we may have had. The absolute best thing is that they cleaned up their work area every day without fail. They put up plastic so construction dust in the rest of the house was kept to a minimum which I really appreciated.
If you are wondering if Horizon is the company for you – our answer is YES! Do it, you will be very happy with the result. We sure are!"
5,"We chose Horizon Construction because of Mark's vision for our bathrooms in our initial consultation. Our bathrooms are rather small, and we had a few ideas of what we wanted before Mark came over, but he quickly suggested what would and wouldn't work based on his extensive experience and design knowledge. Mark is very good at being straightforward with you on what needs to be done for the space you have to renovate. Some might consider his straightforwardness slightly abrupt, but don't let that put you off - he's very good at what he does and has a passion for his work and the details, and he knows the work his crew does is a reflection of himself and his company (as he should).

We mainly interacted with Enna, Horizon's business manager and design consultant, from that point forward, though Mark did visit the project regularly. He also made himself available at any time should you want to go over any details with him. Enna's responsiveness and regular communication is a big reason we are as happy as we are with how the project turned out. Not many contracting companies have someone like Enna to be your customer service rep., design consultant, project coordinator, complaint department, etc. Enna is very responsive, competent, nice, and professional, and made the 2+ months of having workers in our home a tolerable (and almost pleasant :-) ) experience. 

Day one, Enna and Mark met us at the tile store to sign the contracts and help us pick out flooring, countertops, and glass borders, which was incredibly helpful. Work began quickly afterwards, and the crew was at our house just about every week day for around 2 months. Each crew member was very nice, respectful, hard working, and we trusted them implicitly to work and lock up after themselves while we were at work. Coming home from work each day was an exciting event; seeing progress was a treat and they always cleaned up after themselves each day. 

Mark visited the site regularly and corrected any issues and small details he found, and listened to any concerns we had. We never felt we were being given the runaround or that our ideas and concerns were insignificant. For example they installed a 4"" vanity backsplash which didn't connect well to a 6"" wood trim piece. We pointed it out and they tore out the marble backsplash and redid it to 6"". 

Now, I'm not saying there weren't frustrations. Some language barriers and miscommunication between ourselves, management, and the crew reared its head from time to time, but whenever issues arose they were always fixed to our satisfaction and never impacted the end product. I don't believe you can have a multi-month long project without these issues arising, and I chalk them up as normal, and don't mark them down for this. 

One miscommunication example was that we asked them to put insulation in the shower plumbing wall which bordered the bedroom for noise reduction. They forgot to do this during the rough plumbing and said if we still wanted it done, they would open up the drywall in the bedroom side, then patch and paint the bedroom wall, which they did end up doing. This was a minor issue, and we would have been fine if they didn't want to do the work, but they went out of their way to make us happy.

Other minor issues stemmed from the crew not looking at the fixtures we purchased before finishing the rough plumbing in the first bathroom. Their expectation was that we would point out anything other than standard fixtures (we had a bar with handheld shower head; they assumed fixed shower head). Our expectation was that they would check with us before commencing rough plumbing (or at least take a look at the fixtures). The result ended up not being a big issue - a slightly less than ideal placement for the water outlet valve. However, we learned a valuable lesson and made sure to go over rough plumbing for the master bath with them beforehand.

In the end, both baths turned out beautiful, more so than I imagined. Overall, we had a very positive experience and highly recommend Horizon. 

A few tips: 
Get your fixtures early; unless you're ordering from a big box store, some items take a few weeks to get in. 

Make sure your expectations and visions are communicated. Enna writes up a detailed scope of work, make sure this is correct, though some items are difficult to envision when you initially go over the contract. 

Make sure to meet with Mark and show him your fixtures and expected placements before the crew starts rough plumbing. It will be much more difficult to change things once this has started."
5,"We had recently purchased a home and wanted to do some extensive remodeling before we moved in. That job included:
- Installing a new loft in a room that had a vaulted ceiling, and tying that new 2nd floor room into the existing stairs and hallway. This included new recessed lighting for both the new loft, and the now-shorter bottom floor room.
- Remodel the kitchen, including removal of an old fireplace to open up the kitchen and living room, new tile floors, reface and refinish all cabinets, replace all appliances, new backsplash
- Create a new bedroom from an existing open space, and re-frame the closet walls in the new room and in the adjoining master closet
- New wood floors in the 1st floor of the house, and new carpeting in the 2nd floor
- New interior paint throughout
- Refinish the front door
- Miscellaneous (installing new lights/fans/etc)

This project required securing a few city permits, which Horizon did without problem.

All in, I think this was about a 3.5mo project. We did not move in until it was completed.

We now love Angie's List because that's how we found Horizon, Mark, Enna, and Eli !

We've had both good contractor experiences, and otherwise. We had never used Horizon prior to this job. Our experience with Horizon has gone very well over these months. We wished we had a bigger budget to have them do more work for us, because they do great work at good value, but eventually we simply had to stop so we could move in.

Horizon is geared for client satisfaction on reasonably sized general contractor jobs. Here's a few excerpts of our experience:
- As we were settling on early design decisions, Mark was really helpful. Mark has a unique set of skills in design, engineering, contracting, etc. He brought great ideas forward that were good value decisions. For example, we were creating a new bedroom for our son which was on the small side. He recognized that, and came up with the idea to reconfigure the closet and master bdrm closet that was reasonable, got us a bigger room for our son, and made use of wasted space so that the master closet is still the same size or slightly larger.
- We had many conversations, as normal for such a project, about materials, finishes, and etc. Mark was really helpful at guiding those discussions to make good value decisions, based on what he heard from us. We've had contractors in the past who really know only one style or price-point and try to push it constantly, but we felt that Mark did a great job of listening to what we wanted and coming up with good creative ideas and compromises based on our objectives.
- Mark, Enna, and Eli were all consistent and reliable. If they said they would meet us at the house at a certain time, they were there on time and ready. We'd be lying if we said they were perfect, but they really made every effort to do their best.
- Our area has a substantial list of HOA requirements. We never once had a single complaint from a neighbor or HOA the entire time, despite a lot of work being done. They hauled off their own trash so our little trash bin wasn't overwhelmed, and generally kept the place picked up. Thanks, Eli !
- Shortly after we started w/Horizon, my husband noticed that somebody had backed into the mailbox and asked Mark if he thought one of his guys had done it. Mark just looked at it, and said ""Don't worry, I'll fix it."" A couple days later, a new mailbox is there that matched the old one, all fixed up. No debates, just happened.
- Near the end of the project, my husband made a comment about how the drain plumbing was routed. A couple days later, it was fixed. Again, no big debate or issue, just happened.
- After our front door was refinished, the exterior had a green tint to it that we had not expected. It wasn't terrible, and perhaps we were the only ones who would notice. Mark asked how we liked it, and could tell from our first reaction we didn't really like how it looked. But, it was not a terrible issue and we formally told Mark and Enna, in writing, that we'd accept it as-is and not to worry resanding/finishing it only for a modest cosmetic issue. It looked fine, and quality was good, but we just had an expectation of a more brownish deep wood finish. A week or so later, they refinished the door anyway, and now looks perfect.

There are more little stories like that, but you get the point. We thought that Horizon was highly focused on Customer Satisfaction in the way they ran the project from beginning to end. They took care to do good quality work, sought client feedback in a constructive way, and addressed issues quickly and practically. They had to get some city permits in this project which they got without a big problem, and they passed all the city inspections without issue.

One of the things which makes Horizon unique from others we considered was that there was no middle-man handoff from the Sales rep to the person who actually manages the job. We worked with Mark, Enna, and later Eli throughout the entire project. We really enjoyed getting to know them, and we thought the continuity of the relationship definitely contributed to the efficient outcome.

In our experience with Horizon, we found them to be professional, ethical, skilled, and hard-working throughout the process. We would recommend Horizon to our own family members.

Thank You, Horizon. You are a great team !"
5,"Horizon Construction immediately responded to our request for a quote. Mark came out to the house, listened to our ideas, and helped us to plan a remodel that exactly fit what we wanted. He also helped with picking out materials that fit our budget.
Work started on time (once all permits were approved), and moved quickly, without any work breaks.
There were no issues in contacting Horizon, and any issues that came up during the project were quickly addressed. 
We would highly recommend the Horizon team (Mark, Enna, and Sam) to any of our friends.
Looking forward to doing business with them again."
5,"Rescued from a nightmare!!!

We had a horrific experience with another contractor which left us with a bathroom that we couldn't use. The contractor lost their license and we were left with realizing we were going to have to start all over again.

Horizon came in a rescued us from our misery and delivered a beautiful new master bathroom! We were able to even get our guest bathroom a partial facelift too and we paid about the same for all of it! The work was done on time and their experts workers were very courteous and always left our house in great shape after a hard day's work.

We will recommend Horizon to all of our friends and family.

5,"Complete remodel of all the entire downstairs and common area of upstairs of 3,100 square foot home. Work included 1) kitchen (design, demolition of old kitchen, new cabinets, granite countertops, plumbing, electrical, relocation of gas cook top and vents, stone flooring, baseboards, and painting 2) family room (design, removal of wet bar, new cabinets, granite countertops, new fireplace, wood flooring, baseboards, and painting), 3) living room (wood flooring, electrical, baseboards, and painting), 4) powder room (design, new cabinets, granite countertops, plumbing, electrical, baseboards, and stone flooring), 5) laundry room (stone flooring, baseboards, and painting), 6) refinishing of wood staircase and upstairs cabinets, and 7) carpet upstairs.

As you can see, this was a major remodel project. I wanted a contractor to oversee all aspects, work with me on the design, stay on top of the job, do professional grade work, and show up every day, all at a fair price. I got that with Horizon. You can go with a cheaper contractor but I doubt you will get all of these qualities. Mark spent a lot of time with my wife and I selecting cabinets, granite countertops, and flooring making design suggestions. He also made recommendations as the job progressed. Enna was in contact with me daily and was a pleasure to deal with. The job started the day they said it would and ended on time. I checked the work done daily. If there was every an issue or I was not happy for some reason it was corrected without discussion. Horizon even did some upgrades to improve the look of the job and did not charge for it. They did not charge any large up front fees instead I paid as each aspect of the job was started and completed. Mark did a final inspection at the end sending some workers back to do minor touch ups. I would highly recommend Horizon."
5,We recently had new wood floors installed in the entire downstairs of our house.  The job included demolition of existing tile and carpet.  They hauled away the old tile and carpet and did a wonderful job installing my new floors.  Horizon also converted my old patio into a new patio/sunroof.  They added walls around the existing patio and installed windows and a sliding  glass door and doggy door.  I had a wonderful experience working with Horizon Construction and Remodeling.  Mark Besnos and Enna Eskin were very pleasant to talk to and they responded to every call I made to them.  Mark was on the job frequently to be sure things were being done to my satisfaction.  His crew was very hard working and did an excellent job - they were on the job daily and always cleaned up prior to leaving.  I was amazed at the progress that was made each day.  The entire job took approximately 4 weeks and stayed within my budget.  I am very pleased with the final product.  My floors are beautiful and I love my new patio/sunroom.  I would very highly recommend them to anyone that had a  job to be done.  I definitely plan to use them again in the future.
5,"Mark provided the second estimate on my kitchen remodel.  After making some recommendations and suggestions, we settled on a design, and Mark and Enna did their best to work within my budget while still providing quality materials and equipment.  

Enna held my hand through picking out my countertops and cabinets, and even guided me through the purchase of my appliances.   Mark came up with a great design based on my needs and what I had to work with.   Along the way there was some stress and misunderstandings, but both Mark and Enna worked tirelessly to make me happy and come up with great resolutions.    We were in contact every day either by phone or email, and Mark even rushed over on a Saturday when I needed my gas turned back on. 

I can't say enough about the finished product.  It is one of the most beautiful kitchens I've ever seen and it's mine.   Thanks Mark and Enna"
5,"Horizon Construction and Remodeling performed a complete remodel of two bathrooms, including expansion of exterior walls to increase size of bathrooms.
The completed work went beyond expectations. Top quality results. The workers were punctual, courteous and cleaned up after themselves. We enthusiastically recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling for anyone seeking to remodel.
   We also recently added another job for this company, new railing and stairs. An awesome job again ."
5,"Horizon Constructions remodeled our guest bathroom, turning a tub into a walk-in frameless glass door shower, replacing the floor, the vanity and the toilet.  

Having had my kitchen remodeled with a different contractor, I was very impressed by the punctuality of Horizon Construction, Enna always kept me updated and in the loop of what to expect and when!  Also updated us promptly on any issues or problems.

Mark had a very keen eye for design and gave us suggestions on the materials for both the floors and the shower and also few other design elements.

Also, they replaced the glass door when Mark noticed a crack that both me and my husband missed!  We really liked the professionalism and the meticulousness that Mark and Enna showed.

It has been two months since the job was completed, but I encountered a recent problem with the shower door and contacted Enna about it.  She assured us when the job was finished that the bathroom was under warranty as well.  She is working on getting the issue addressed.  I love the follow up and the fact that they stand behind their work.

I would definitely recommend this company."
4,"We had a bathroom from 1964 completly remodeled. The original bathroom was about 10 ft. by 4-1/2 ft. with a tub/ shower and dividing wall. We had the tub removed and one wall torn out and rebuilt to expand the room by 2-1/2 ft. We had the original window removed and replaced it with a custom size window which was built into the shower walll. This required structural wall modifications and outside stucco work. We moved all of the plumbing to allow for a large tile shower to be built. This required cutting the slab foundation and installing new drain plumbing for the shower, toilet and sink. New vent pipes were required and had to be installed in the new wall and thru the roof. The shower required extensive plumbing to allow for a cieling rain can, body sprays and a hand held head. We added a fan/ light which required venting thru the roof. The shower was tiled from floor to cieling and the remainder of the room was also tiled about 40"" up from the floor. A frameless 3/8"" glass door was also installed. Two recessed lights were installed in the shower cieling along with vanity lighting."
5,"Horizon remodeled 3 average-sized bathrooms, and re-tiled a fireplace. The job included: Hot-mopping and floating cement on showers, installing tile on floors, shower, bath surround, and fireplace, installing bathtub, custom shower door and vanities, quartz countertops, sinks, toilets, faucets, fans and lighting, painting, installing baseboards, and bath accessories. 

When I first met with Mark Besnos, it was clear that he had an eye for detail. Mark had some great design ideas, and helped me pick out tile, cabinets. Everything was done very professionally; Mark drew up a detailed contract, and all changes were made with addendums. Mark also provided all of the relevant licenses and insurance documents without having to ask. In the end Mark made sure every last detail was perfect. 

Enna Eskin did an amazing job managing the project. She was always super friendly, knowledgeable, and professional, and was great about using email and text to keep in touch while I was at work. Enna kept me informed of what was happening throughout, and also let me know ahead of time when there were things that I needed to do. 

The work crews were friendly, and considerate. They worked very hard, and performed high-quality work. They did a good job of protecting my floors and furniture, and keeping the mess to a minimum. 

I love my new bathrooms and fireplace. Everything turned out beautifully, and was done on time and within budget."
4,"Early in 2012 we took three contractors' bids for a master bath remodel for our home. In addition to a price we could afford, Horizon Construction gave us some good design ideas and a feeling that they would take good care of us. They weren't the cheapest bid, but we wanted to work with someone who got all the costs out there up front, without adding on later. We felt that's how they made their bid, so we selected them for our job. 

The project would remove the small glass shower enclosure and basically unused bathtub that were there from the original home construction, and also upgrade the vanity with a nicer piece and put a granite top on it. The old toilet would be replaced. The linoleum floor would be replaced with tile which would match nicely the tile of the new shower enclosure. Since we don't use the bathtub, we opted to have more open space beside a larger shower enclosure, and no bathtub. Horizon would also install the toilet, sinks and plumbing fixtures that we furnished for the job; mount new mirrors over the vanity, install new lighting, and paint the walls.

My wife and I didn't have firm ideas on the decor, so the consultation from Horizon was very helpful. We did a session at the building materials showroom together. Once we settled on the color scheme and materials, and the fixtures that we needed to furnish to them for installation, the demolition work began and was finished very quickly and cleanly. Horizon did almost all of the work during the daytime when my wife and I were both at work. They took good care of our house and securely locked it up at the end of their day when they left.

The floor and shower tile work was perfect, and the custom glass (nothing fancy, just clear but it's just what we wanted) was installed on time, and still looks great. Part-way along Horizon suggested we consider a unique tile backsplash around the vanity, using the same accent tiles that are in the floor and the shower. They gave us a special price and although we hadn't wanted to add to our budget, we took their offer. It's a really pretty blue aqua glass tile that is the key element to the whole decoration scheme. The look we got is a bit unique, and breaks from the cookie-cutter conservative approach of the original homebuilder. Very nice and more than worth the money. If we ever sell the home, we'll point out the very custom look of the vanity.

Horizon got the building inspections and everything got approved straight off. Once the painting was done there were just a few finishing touches to get, but Horizon finished ahead of the project schedule, which is nice if your master bathroom opens onto your master bedroom and you're actually trying to live there, as we were! My son was so glad that we didn't have to share his bathroom any longer. But the bottleneck was worth it when work was complete.

Incidentally, for the new toilet, which we picked up at Costco (remember, tight budget), we bought the AMDM IntelliSeat, an electronic toilet seat (if you don't know what it is, just Google it...once you have it, you can't go back) to replace the standard seat. Although Horizon didn't seem to have experience with that product, they installed it perfectly and we love it.

About six months after the project was completed and we'd paid our final check to Horizon, the motion-sensing light switch they'd installed in the bathroom began malfunctioning. It got to be too annoying so I gave Horizon a call to see if they'd fix it for us. They reminded me that they made a full warranty on all their work, and scheduled someone to come out and work on the switch. Their man came to our house and replaced the faulty switch with a new one, which now works perfectly.

We love our bathroom and are so satisfied with Horizon's work. They are friendly professionals who follow up, deal with issues and problems when they occur, finish ahead of schedule, and back up their work."
5,"This project included total demo and reconstruction of 3 bathrooms. It included converting the master bath from a Roman tub to a walk-in shower with travertine to the top of all walls which had cathedral ceilings and a triangular window. and replacing toilets, vanities, sinks, and all fixtures. In the guest bath, the tub was replaced with a new tub and travertine on the walls. The sink, vanity and toilet were also replaced, adding an enclosure using 3/8 inch sliding doors. In the downstairs shower, old ceramic tile was removed and replaced with travertine. The toilet, vanity, and sink were also replaced. The floors in all bathrooms were removed and replaced with travertine.
 
In late September 2012, after getting an estimate from another company for our planned remodel of 2 bathrooms, a large master bath and a smaller downstairs bath, we made an appointment with Horizon Construction and Remodeling for an estimate. We had previously read reviews here on Angie’s List.
Mark arrived at the designated time, discussed with us our plans, then took measurements of the bathrooms. He also made suggestions regarding the project. He suggested that we meet with him at MSI to look at a variety of materials so he could more accurately provide an estimate.
After deciding to have Horizon do the project, we made an appointment with Mark to go over the contract, scope of work, and the payment schedule. It was determined that work could begin on October 3 but since demolition could only begin midday, We decided that early morning the following day would be best.
The demolition crew arrived as scheduled and the project was started. Demolition of the 2 bathrooms was completed in 2 days and work began on the remodel construction. Each segment of the project went smoothly. In the meantime, we went with Mark to select a marble slab for the countertops. We also met with the cabinet maker regarding the custom vanities and color of the stain.
Work progressed smoothly and ahead of schedule. Along the way, we made several changes. Enna was very helpful in accomplishing those changes and doing the paperwork involved. She is an invaluable asset to the company.
When the original project was well on its way to completion, we decided to go ahead and do the third bathroom since we had enough marble left from the slab to do the countertop. Also, the vanity in the upstairs guest bath was the same size as the downstairs bath which made the custom construction easier and more efficient.
Mark was here on a regular basis to check on progress, answer questions, and listen to our concerns. In some cases, he had noticed things that needed correction before we even brought them up.
Any remodel project, and especially one of this magnitude, is stressful. I know of several cases where projects lasted much longer than anticipated but that was not the case here. The projected completion date was January 10, 2013, however, work was completed December 15, 2012, which made our Holiday Season more enjoyable than it might have otherwise been! The master bath, which was converted from a Roman tub to a walk-in shower is amazing and the other two bathrooms are elegant as well.
Horizon Construction and Remodeling is dependable and you can expect them to do what they agreed to do. The quality of their work is good and everyone we encountered was responsible for their part of the job. My only admonition to you is that you make sure the scope of work that you sign off on includes all the things you discussed and thought would be there.
If you have a project in mind, call Horizon Remodeling and Construction and give them an opportunity to discuss it with you before you make a final decision. We are pleased with how our bathrooms came out and would not hesitate to call Horizon for another project"

They are incredible, I would give them the highest rating possible without a shadow of a doubt. They are professional and do great work every time we have had them out. Their communication is great and they are all perfectionists. I would recommend them to anyone in the future. I have never had a better experience. Mark has great vision for remodeling and always holds his work to a higher standard
Horizon Construction was outstanding to work with from beginning to end. Mark Besnos is a visionary who does exceptional work. Mark and Enna (owners) were in constant communication with continual supervision to ensure quality results.They transformed a tired 1970's condo into a beautiful living environment. We will use this professional contractor again in our future remodel."
5,It was a pleasure working with Mark and Enna and all of their crew members. Mark and Enna went out of their way to find just the right fixtures and French doors that  I envisioned for my new master bedroom. I am especially happy with the double doors that were hung on my new closet. I was very pleased with how much attention was given to the finest details and how quickly they were able to complete the construction.
5,"We enjoyed working with Mark and Enna to remodel and update our master bathroom. Mark was especially helpful during the planning phase when he listened patiently to our endless questions and provided useful information and suggestions that helped us reach decisions about project materials and stylistic choices. After work began, Mark and Enna continued to be very responsive to us regarding scheduling aspects of the work and finalizing decisions about the details. Throughout the process, they stressed that the goal was to create a master bathroom that we would really enjoy, even if that meant occasionally changing our minds about details or adding new work at times. This was our first major renovation project, and we feel that Mark, Enna and their team did a great job guiding us through it and creating a great new room to enhance our home."
5,"Our kitchen & Den was recently remodeled and everyone we dealt with @ SOD Home Group was nice, professional, and performed quality work. 
The entire staff was committed to ensuring that the experience met our expectations. Whenever we had a question or concern on anything they addressed it immediately. We would highly recommend SOD Home Group for your renovations."
5,"From start to finish, SOD Home Group was phenomenal to work with, and they went above and beyond in designing and building the addition of our dreams. Everyone we worked with (our designers, our carpenter, production supervisor, office staff) were all so friendly, competent and professional. It was as painless an experience as possible, given that we remodeled our whole house while living in it.
They really pulled that off !"
5,"They did an excellent job! We are very satisfied with the price, quality, and professional installation. They remodeled the kitchen in a timeframe that they promised. I’m looking forward to starting the bathroom remodeling project in a few months. Everything in our kitchen matches the theme we were going for.
I would recommend them to anyone needing to update their kitchen!"
5,"We recently decided to sell our home and needed some work done quickly ( kitchen, bathroom and master bedroom). I contacted SOD Home Group and as expected, they made it happen. We had the teams out within a week. And, most importantly, the work was still at the same high caliber as it always is. They finished everything in 3 weeks. I will certainly use them again as I know they do quality job. We love our home so much that we feel bad to sell it now."
5,"I am thoroughly pleased with SOD HOME GROP From design creation to the project manager I can not praise them enough for their professionalism and attention to detail. Once we agreed on the initial aspects of the job, work began. Our project manager was open to our ideas, provided many thoughts of his own, and made time on multiple occasions to go over selection of materials and to review the design. 
I tell EVERYONE I know how consistently fantastic this company is. Our room addition looks better than we ever imagined it could be!"
5,"We were looking for a  local reputable remodeling company to renovate our entire home. Thankfully, we came across SOD HOME GROUP Company, who proven to be an expert in home remodeling and interior designing. They did a fantastic job and gave our home a stylish and sophisticated look. We had a great experience with this company. Highly recommended! Charles Martin"
5,"They just finished to renovate our guest house and backyard  for us and it turned out great. Extremely professional. From the very beginning, he provided a line by line estimate so that there was never any confusion about what needed to be done. We never had to worry that he was going come back to us and ask for more money. Communication was excellent. I felt confident that I could reach them by phone or text at any time. When unexpected issues arose, they were quick to do everything they could to see that it was taken care of in a timely manner. Would absolutely recommend and will use again in the future."
5,"This company is amazing. Their Crews showed up on time fully equipped and did an amazing job restoring everything. After the demolition and the removal of the our guest house they set the equipment up in a very clean and workable set up. They are very knowledgeable and very educational. They took the time to educate my wife and myself about every step and how every step was going to happen and the goals that had to be met before each step could move on. When they left the house each day it look they had never even been here. They were so meticulous with their clean up, it was amazing. I would recommend them highly to everybody!"
5,"Active participation, attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of both quality and timely project execution are just some of the attributes this team exemplifies! I have had the privilege of being awarded several projects over the years and have thoroughly enjoyed working with SOD Home Group Team! I look forward to even more successful projects with these professionals and your home could be their next masterpiece! Thanks a lot!"
5,"The renovations of our three bathrooms, kitchen and Guest House went great and the transformations were amazing! I HIGHLY recommend Christian ! He is timely, fair priced, easy to work with, meticulous and does great work. Nowadays , it's hard to trust someone in your house. I have to say he earned our trust even enough that we left him with a key to our house while we went on a vacation and came home to our beautiful home! We are very pleased!"
5,"Oren and his team were amazing and I could not give them a higher recommendation!! We had an attic project that involved a bathroom and bedroom, and creating a new room in an old, very tight space. Oren provided us a response via email, saw the space and provided an estimate within 2 days, then started the project and completed it within another 3-4 weeks! His work is beautiful, his estimate was right in the middle and far less than we were expecting (and he stayed right on budget!) and his team was extremely professional, timely and responsive to our questions. Could not say more good things about SOD HOME GROUP. This is exactly what we wanted!!"
5,Oren is very professional and quick to get a hold with when you need things done. I work with him to fix some issue with my condo when i was putting it on the market. And still working with him on the house I am about to buy with the inspection issues. He gives very reasonable prices to fix the problem.
5,"Our Garage conversion designer, was amazing. The only agenda was that we create spaces that fit us and our lifestyle, and that we be thrilled with the outcome. They never pushed us and always listened to us and responded to what we wanted. Honestly, he is the consummate designer and professional. SOD HOME GROUP gets a standing ovation."
5,"Don't look anywhere else. To say that my job didn't go exactly according to plan would be an understatement and Mario and his entire team were pros from start to finish. Our job was a demo of our old guest house and rebuilding, designing and installing a beautiful new guest house under the watchful eye of Mario and the team. The consistent communication from Mario was also a huge plus as the home is a complete remodel and I'm rarely on site. Finally, remember that you get what you pay for; there may be cheaper contractors out there, but there aren't any better - take that to heart."
5,"I can't thank SOD Home group enough. They were organized from the onset. Their presentation was better than anyone else that my family and I looked requested bids from. They were great through every step of the process. From demolition, to installing/building everything, to having it all completed. I enjoyed the process of it all. Awesome."
5,"Oren from SOD Home Group , led our house renovation project over a period of five weeks.  Oren and his team were responsive, professional and accommodating of our requirements - from the initial estimate meeting up to the finish of the project. We even added items to the original scope, along the way, and they were still able to complete on time and on budget.  
As the project came to an end, we had to do a detailed quality check ourselves, but once we pointed out any outstanding finishes, they finished the job to perfection. We would definitely work with Oren and team again for any future renovation needs."
5,"This started out as a project to make my mother in laws home ADA compliant, and we ended up updating the entire home. It seemed logical after discussions with Mario, and so we moved forward. The project was completed very quickly due to our timeline and the results are phenomenal! Working with contractor Mario was a pleasure. He is honest and hard-working and is a complete contrast to my previous experiences. Will use them for all my future projects."
5,"After interviewing several companies for the room addition project, we hired SOD Home Group. We were very impressed with the vision, professionalism, and ideas from our sales representative Mario . We valued all the detailed and self-explanatory estimates and budget, including the schedule that was presented to us before we signed the contract. When the remodeling project started, we were updated daily via e-mails and additional visits by Mario. The people who worked at the house on the project were respectful of our house and they always cleaned at the end of each day. They also guided us with all the interior design with the selection of light fixtures, floor tiles, and paint color/style choices. At the end of the remodeling project, it addressed any detail that we needed additional attention on.
Our room addition turned out to be a success and it’s our favorite room in my home :)"
5,"Oren is fantastic! His team seriously saved my butt. I hired them, to remodel my kitchen and 3 bathrooms, and am so very glad that I did. They worked very hard to deliver on a timeline that was, I'm sure, terrible- but they really came through for me. He's gone out of his way to make a difficult situation less stressful. Oren is extremely professional and I would highly recommend him. He's clearly very knowledgeable, and has been very communicative. Seriously can't thank him enough for bailing me out of this mess"
5,We had needed to replace our bathroom. We set up a meeting with SOD Home Group team. Oren was extremely professional. He explained the process and our choices and was very pleasant and professional. The project was handled very professionally - the workers were punctual and cleaned up after themselves daily. The project was completed on time for exactly what Oren had quoted in the estimate. He was easy to get in touch with if we had questions. The Bathroom looks amazing. This company stands by its warranty and its word. We were thrilled with the service we received them and would highly recommend this company.
5,"Today, I met the designer who’ll be my right hand planning our kitchen and 2 bathrooms renovation. The designer was very informative and guided me in choosing my desired design and suggested us to think about how we’ll be preparing meals, and consider schedule before setting a date for work to begin. I am very excited for the results! Absolutely excellent customer service!"
5,"What a fresh breath of air speaking to Mario. His honesty and non sales approach to helping me understand the process
After thinking about an ADU for such a long time we finally started looking into it the last 5 months. We spoke to a lot of contractors and really felt comfortable with the knowledge and value this company had. We could not be happier with the result highly recommend!!!"
5,We had a major large bath remodel....Every pat of the job from the virtual design to punch out was handled without any issues.  I was most impressed  how they did not nickel and dime me for minor changes. .  Special thanks to Mario who obviously have renovated hundreds of baths
5,"Full bath basement project finished on budget. The crew was Very punctual, good quality work and cleaned up every evening when finished. Project turned out good and I would recommend"
5,"Absolutely the best ADU contractor ( well
At least we think they are ) . They did a spectacular job creating a 900 sqft 2bed, 1.5bath dwelling unit on my house earlier in 2021. From designing the floorplans to handling the paperwork and picking the right materials to the actual construction, I was beyond pleased with their knowledge and expertise at each step. The finished product superseded our expectations. I feel fully confident in giving a high recommendation for this company for your ADU project. You Rock !!"
5,SOD Home Group went above and beyond and delivered better than what I could have imagined. They stand by their work and I will be working with them on my future projects. Thank you for getting our room addition done in time for the holidays.
5,"SOD Home Group  is definitely one of the premier renovation contractors in CA. These guys aren't your typical contractors who show up in an old truck, 2 hours late, and do the job half-ass. They're pros. Seriously. Down to their branding, customer service and quality of work. You get what you pay for and SHG is well worth your money if you want the job done right."
5,"We were quite pleased with SOD Home Group - from the initial consultation, changes made based on budget and preference, help with picking colors, patterns and materials. Everyone involved was pleasant and patient with us. 
The finished work looks great, and the few items that have required 'tweaks' post project have been handled quickly and cheerfully.
Will use them again, I'm sure!"
5,"It was a pleasure working with Oren and his crew, we would definitely call them again. They were in touch with us almost everyday letting us know what was going on and if we had any questions. All of the crews that came were professional, flexible and thorough, any issues were promptly taken care of without fuss. We ended up spending more than we had anticipated mainly because of Oren’s enthusiasm and the designs they prepared for us were outstanding, it was hard to say no. The finished work is beautiful, we are very happy!"
5,"as a woman, I appreciate how respectful Oren was when providing me with an estimate, going over the contract, and discussing the end results. Although I knew nothing about room addition, he did not make me feel dumb regardless of how many questions I had or explanations I required. He was thorough and transparent. He complied with my requests and made sure I was 100% comfortable with moving forward. I was impressed how quick and efficiently the team worked. After 10 bids and lots of reference checking, they were among the best in pricing, customer service, and job completion."
5,"SOD Home Group completed a major remodel and home addition project for us.  We interviewed a few other contractors, but SOD stood out because of their fair pricing, confidence and professionalism.  We interviewed two other home owners who had used SOD in the past and they had great things to say about Oren and his group.  They transformed our ageing 1600 sq.ft. home into an amazing 2900 sq. ft. that is absolutely breathtaking.  Since this was our dream home being built, we were very involved in selecting materials for the project and the SOD team was very accommodating. They also worked well with other contractors like HVAC, fire sprinkler and sidewalk.   They executed the job to perfection while coordinating with the city for inspections. They did a great job with everything from the laying of the new foundation, framing, electrical, plumbing.  The best part was that they did an excellent job of finishing including flooring, painting, etc.  They were very responsive to fixing minor touch-ups even after we had moved in.  I would whole heartedly recommend SOD."
5,SOD Home Group folks worked on our bedroom remodel. The work was done on time and the quality was great.
5,"I wanted to do a tech update and remodel to my home in Saratoga. The home was outdated for my style. The SOD Home Group team could handle everything. I had a designer that I wanted to use, but they didn’t pan out and SOD Home Group hooked me up with another designer who did an amazing job. They worked together well, so my experience was very easy. Oren kept me up to date as far as they progress. His experience as a General Contractor made me feel at ease. He really knows what he’s doing. We opened the space up and did a lot of updates, including the pool, which needed to be updated and repaired. The result is exactly what I wanted, and I didn’t have to stay out of my home longer than estimated which I was nervous about. Everything turned out great! Worth every penny!"
5,"We were considering remodeling our entire house for several years now and we just never had the money to. When we could finally afford it, we were so spooked about hiring a contractor. Every story we heard was so terrifying! Everyone we knew remodeled got ripped off, the contractor did a horrible job and had to redo the project, or simply took their money and never showed up. We went on a couple of different routes to deeply search and find the right contractor for our project. After meeting a couple of them, we signed a contract with SOD Home Group. They had great appearance online and when we asked if they can take us to a few of their completed and ongoing projects, Oren did not hesitate! Oren immediately agreed. We remodeled our kitchen, bathrooms, living room, dining room, backyard, front yard, and added a new laundry room. Oren’s crew was so respectful, clean, and always on time. Living in your home through construction can be a little bothersome and disturbing. Not to mention that you have no privacy but SOD Home Group crew gave us as much privacy as possible and also disturbed me as little as possible since we work from home (since this COVID started). The quality and craftsmanship they provided is just superb! If you are looking for an honest, and trustworthy contractor definitely call SOD home Group! Oren and the team made what we thought would be a horrible experience into a marvelous, easy-going! we’ll certainly be contacting them down the road for all my remodeling projects."
5,"I took 5 estimates for our remodeling project that included the garage, kitchen, 2 bathrooms. SOD Home Group was by far the fairest bid and the most knowledgeable contractor. Oren was my project manager. Unlike one of the other contractors who completely disregarded my ideas, Oren listened to my ideas and helped me realize them. The project ran into some delays as Oren worked to clear through permitting challenges. Thank goodness that Oren was so diligent in resolving those challenges. Oren and I were in constant contact from the beginning of the year until mid-July, when the job was completed (and I mean constant communication, daily). The consistent communication was also very appreciated. At the end of the day, I felt I could trust Oren, and that is a truly rare thing. If you need help with any remodeling project, give these guys a call — they are good."
5,"The best way I can explain my experience with this company is that everything was done marvelously. One thing Oren promised us from day one is that we will get custom work. That’s exactly what we received - custom remodeling in all matters of the project. Oren helped us hire a custom cabinet maker. They did custom kitchen cabinets, linen closets and our bathroom vanities. Next we needed custom doors and windows since our house was so old and we had to fit all sizes, so once again Oren helped us hire a custom door and window maker. Since we have a large space and the flooring runs through pretty much both top and bottom level and we didn’t want to rip out the old woods, we had to hire someone to make us new custom flooring to match the old one that they had put in close to 90 years ago. We also ended up redoing all of our electric lines, plumbing lines, drain lines and gas lines. Oren helped us hire a plaster specialist who could duplicate the plaster texture that they had done many years ago. He also could help us find the company to duplicate the old plaster base and ceiling molding. Because this was such an old house and large house, we had to get the right contractor to do custom remodeling work. Oren could find us all the local specialists who work in older homes and can duplicate the quality and craftsmanship of what they had used earlier on. We had a lot of woodwork which needed to be customized, not just installation, but also custom making the actual moldings from scratch. One of the best things about Oren was that he had the answers to a lot of our questions. But what I like most about him is that he didn’t get scared of a challenge and in fact pursuited head-on. If there was something that he didn’t know, he wouldn’t just say, well that’s not my problem. He would help us find the right person or company to do that. I’m truly grateful that we could find Oren and his company to help us renovate this property. The house looks marvelous but the best thing about it is that you can’t tell that it was done now it still looks like it was built 100 years ago. What Oren could do for us was that he gave us great ideas to keep the old charm of the house but still update the house where we have a smart home and smart thermostat and the ability to control a lot of different aspects from our phones or tablets. I truly believe that we spent a premium on this renovation. But it was definitely worth it because the house looks marvelous and the property values since we have done the renovation have gone through the roof. Oren was definitely the most expensive contractor that we had interviewed but he was also the most understanding and the most caring. Also another great thing about him was that he was always accessible to us. Whether we called him, texted him or emailed him he would always get back to us immediately. I have heard of horror stories from other clients and contractors. I’m glad that this was not our experience."
5,"I’ve been through my share of remodels and almost all the experiences took more time, more money...you know the story. And then my mother’s condo had water damage, which was uninhabitable. Despite solid insurance, the moment the tests came back positive for mold and sewage, we knew this was going to be a complete move out, demo and remodel. I had 5 bids come back and chose Oren with SOD Hoe Group. He and his team are my heroes. Open communication, direct eye contact, honest opinions, quick problem solving, and most of all, they took care of us when COVID hit and the building shut down to all contractors. Even though we had weeks left on our schedule to get the job done, I could have the Board give us 5 days so that my mother could move back in and they made it happen with no changes to the original renderings. Oren’s communication was impeccable, with immediate responses to every question and request. The craftsmanship is PERFECTION! Thank you, Oren!!!"
5,"We started our complete remodeling project by remodeling the kitchen and bathrooms and because it went much better than we expected… we remodeled all the other sections of the house (front and back yard, pool, garage and more…). Oren helped us to select all the finishing materials and fixtures that we needed for the entire remodeling, and his workers worked every day and they completed the project on time. Our huge remodeling project went so well that the house got a fresh look and feel. Oren and the rest of the team did a very professional job and we are very pleased with the results. We recommend them to anyone considering a remodeling project."
5,"Oren and his team at SOD Home Group were beyond excellent regarding my home remodeling project. They were thorough, detailed and kept me informed regarding most of the important parts of the remodeling the entire time. I am mainly pleased with the fresh look and open space of our house which got a fresh look and wide open space. It didn’t matter to us, but there was a bit of a disconnect between the sales pitch timeline and the actual timeline for the demo and installation. I wanted quality, and that’s what I got."
5,"SOD Home Group made our long time vision come true. Overall, we knew what we wanted when we decided to re-landscape our front and back yard, but going from head to paper to reality doesn’t always happen mainly because we wanted too much that at the end would not look good. Lucky for us, Oren, with his exceptional experience and knowledge, could make it happen. Oren’s knowledge as an arborist made it easy for us to communicate our ideas while taking advantage of his design expertise. He was creative in working with our budget, his expert crew was hardworking, conscientious, and respectful of Covid protocol, and Oren continues to follow up to make sure our garden is thriving. We could not be happier with our new front yard, and are looking forward to having SOD Home Group back for future projects."
5,"We have been dreaming for a few years about how we will design the kitchen, what will it have and how it will serve us. We wanted it to be and look no less than perfect. We worked closely with Mr. Oren on the initial design (which after a few corrections and meetings, become the final one) and he gave us many beautiful ideas and solutions to select from and to have as part of the remodeling. At the end, we are happy, very much with his design, work, time frame to finish the remodeling job and his super happy personality. Oren is a pleasure person to work with. He always made sure that our vision of what we want… will matches what he can do and now we are in love with the new kitchen. Very high skilled company and we recommend to anyone that in case they want any beautiful remodeling job with a truly honest company and excellent customer support... they will have to contact this company."
5,"I highly recommend Oren, SOD Home Group! He is very knowledgeable, answered all my questions (and more), very professional, and responsive. He spent over 3 hours showing me all the possibilities that can be done to my kitchen, if you know little about all the little details about remodeling your home (like I do), he will explain it to you in terms that you will completely understand and turns your ideas into this beautiful 3D design. Oren also had great ideas and recommendations on how to attain your dream home. He knows house histories, and why houses were built in a certain way! He is unlike any other contractor that will just throw out random price of how much the renovation could cost you without showing you hard proof. I’m a visual learner, so when Oren made this amazing 3D design using the exact measurement of my kitchen, it blew my mind. It even gave me a chance to actually change few things that did not quite look right with kitchen. Most importantly, he will make sure you will enjoy and have fun designing your home. Oren, you are the best!"
5,"We are really proud and happy to give this rating and review to SOD Home Group based on our excellent experience with Oren, the team of people who worked at our house, and the company. We really value his professionalism. Oren proved us to be very honest, quick understanding person and mainly good listener (based on the fact that he made it happen with our budget). Oren heard our concerns and goals and was very realistic about what to expect for taking on an addition project. Oren also provided us with several additional ideas that we didn’t know we can implement them at all. We decided to hire Oren and his team immediately after we went over his estimate and 3D drawings of the remodeling project. Now that they finished our addition remodeling project (6 months after), we can write clearly that we highly recommend Oren for any major projects for your home."
5,"We hired SOD Home Group to handle a large remodel of my home. Oren and his crew removed a large load-bearing wall and reworked my old living room and kitchen into an open concept floor plan. He also had some great ideas to cleanly route our TV/media equipment into the new coat closet that he built for us. Ultimately, all of our concerns and requests were addressed. My husband and I panicked when our new hardwood floors were incredibly squeaky, and he had his subcontractors come back to fix the problem. When our new kitchen cabinets from Home Depot arrived crooked, his company expertly solved the issue. On top of that, Oren was able to complete our project several weeks earlier than we were hoping. We are expecting to hire Oren again when we will be ready to execute our next home renovation project."
5,"We had creative SOD home Group redo all of our home and due to the COVID-19, it took longer then we thought it would but the final remodeling work is stunning. My husband was very specific about what he wanted and Oren with his professional teams were able to deliver it beyond our expectations. Working with Oren was very easy, straightforward and they were always professional. What made this remodeling safe and well was that Oren made sure that each day the teams will clean as much as they could and that they will wear masks and gloves while working. We don’t think that we will ever going to use any other contractor after having such a significant experience with them. They are definitely our go to."
5,"Oren and his crew just finished the complete remodeling of our new home. The work took several months and during this time they remodeled each space including the kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, entry etc… Oren started with the 3D design and after we agreed on that phase, he came up with execution plan including the prices. The work was managed by him daily and according to the schedule that he planned for us. They informed us on every step of the work while Oren made sure that the price will remain within the agreed budget. We really love the new remodeling and our home got a brand fresh look. We highly recommend Oren and each one of his crew for any remodeling project."
5,"SOD Home Group is the BEST home improvement company by far!! We worked with Oren and his crews of people and right from the beginning of the work, Oren was very professional, honest, hardworking man and good communicator. He always was on time and he made sure that the people will deliver the best results in the work. Our project (which was a complete kitchen remodeling) was completed on time and within the agreed budget. We will use SOD Home Group for all of our future projects."
5,"SOD Home Group did a major renovation in our home, removing two load-bearing walls holding the second floor, remodeling our kitchen, the downstairs bathroom, family room and the roof, a complete remodel. Their price was the second highest out of the five estimates we got, but I was looking for a contractor to provide a high quality and hassle free remodel. I really appreciated the communication via the WhatsApp Oren installed on my phone, which made our communication throughout the design stage and the actual project very easy. There were a few minor hiccups with the color of the grout and some other final finishing, but Oren took care of them to our satisfaction. SOD Home Group is definitely for those who want a thorough professional contractor that provides a high-quality hassle free remodel."
5,"We contracted with SOD Home Group to totally update and remodel a large part of our house that basically included the hallway, complete Kitchen, guest bathroom and 2 additional bathrooms and bedrooms. Oren was honest about the work and gave us a very realistic estimate and a time frame of the completion date for the entire work at our house. This was an excellent plus because all the other contractors that we brought in to our house were just trying to get the remodeling job signed and would probably up charge us later. Oren was very communicative from the first day and a very easy person to reach if we had any question or concern about the work progress or even if we were interesting in a minor change. The teams of workers were respectful and efficient, mainly since we had to complete the job during this COVID-19 timing and to move in with the family during the process. While there were some issues that raised during the work, Oren could get the remodeling job completed and we’re thrilled with our new home. This was really our first and largest remodeling project, so we felt it went as smoothly as possible. Our only issue was the tiles we ended up choosing for the floor and shower were not the best quality. We wish that had been flagged to us sooner since we spent a small fortune on the remodel, but the bathroom looks beautiful and we’d highly recommend shopping around for tile."
5,"We went over many estimates for our complete ADU project we needed to do since we work from home because of COVID. The Addition included: kitchen and a small bathroom. We hesitate on who should we hire for this, as we know stories when the remodeling projects not finished or done correctly. All the contractors we met were too pushy to make us sign, and we didn’t want to move forward with anyone because of that. We met Oren from SOD Home Group. he was very friendly, professional and accessible throughout the entire project. He really did a fabulous work from the design to the demolition and finally the installation. His team came every day; and they completed the work on the promised time. Oren has done the best remodeling in my house, hands-down! And we will definitely contact him soon to also renovate our other house! Trust, friendliness, and professionalism are absolutely what you will get when choosing this company."
5,"SOD Home Group was strongly recommended to me by a co-worker who stated that the company was exceptionally reliable and did a quality job. At first, I thought their price was a bit high but because of the recommendation; I chose to hire them to remodel my entire house. They were great from start to finish. I was worried about bringing a team into the house during COVID, but they were great. They wore masks; they were super respectful and treated my house as a living space and not as a construction zone. The crew was extremely courteous and kind. One of the major reasons I chose to hire SOD Home Group was because I was assured by Oren, the company owner, that he will manage my project directly and that he would be involved in all stages of the project. Oren stood by his word and made sure to always keep me updated throughout all the stages of my project. He made sure I was always aware of the upcoming schedule and verified that I always had all the required materials to keep the project running smoothly and seamlessly. The quality of work came out as expected, stunning! The Kitchen and bathrooms were completely transformed and I feel like I am living in a brand new home. I am so impressed with Oren and SOD Home Group. This project came out better than I could have ever imagined, and I couldn’t be happier."
5,"Oren and the guys at SOD Home Group did a stellar job on our big home remodeling project. We added a second story to our Los Angeles home, nearly doubling it in size. We also moved a kitchen and living room wall and completely gutted our kitchen. We basically rebuilt the entire home, while doing our best to change the character of our home.We had tried to start this process several years back, running into snags and unethical contractors along the way, and are so happy that we landed in the capable hands of this team. At every step along the way, we felt honestly communicated with and cared for on a personal level. Besides this, all the subcontractors they worked with were top-notch and considerate of our neighbors. Not only did they do a remarkable job and make our house the talk of the neighborhood, they went above and beyond to really be sure we were always 100% happy with all the work being done. Even with the pandemic hitting right in the middle of our project, they finished within our original timeline as promised. I would without a doubt recommend them for any project you have, large or small. I’m attaching a few photos to show the scale of our undertaking. Enjoy!"
5,"I hired Oren and SOD to do a major construction and remodel project back in 2015. We received a number of bids and went with SOD b/c they were most competitive, organized, and responsive. Oren took the time to understand our project and vision for the remodel. He said ""once you're a customer, you're always a customer"" and stayed true to that statement. The project progressed according to schedule, which is rare for a project of this size. My 3rd party architect made some mistakes (not SOD's fault) that resulted in change orders, permit delays, and additional expenses -- which Oren ultimately waived in good faith. The project ultimately finished on time and according to budget. We're now 5+ years later and Oren is still committed to ""make it right"" without question as issues arise."
5,"We hired Oren, the contractor for ADU Garage Conversion. We went with him and his team on such a large remodeling project because he is ‘the’ specialist in that area. They also gave me very competitive price. Oren and his team were a real pleasure to work with. Oren and the team that worked at our house were always on time, respectful, disciplined and responsible. The project was finished ahead of the promised schedule and outcome is great. Big thanks to Oren. very honest and helpful person. Highly recommend SOD Home Group!"
5,"SOD Home Group is a company that lets you sleep at night.  They take on your project like they are doing it for themselves.  From the person answering the phone to Oren crunching the numbers to Eden who managed my project and visited our home daily and made sure that the workers are given the right attention to all the details. SOD Home Group become like a family to me who take care of you every step of the way.  I am remodeling my entire home, complete with alternative systems, room additions, and interior/exterior finishes.  Six months of being displaced and watching my home being rebuilt from start to finish.  I made the right decision when selecting SOD Home Group.  They are professional, experienced, and personable.  Half way through the job and I’m still feeling good about my decision."
5,"Oren, Eden and Daniel were wonderful professional people and that we hired for our room addition at our house and to our kitchen project. They were very interested in suggestions we had and very amenable to incorporating them. Nothing of the project was too much for them. They took each and any of our ideas and implemented them into the work while making sure to stay in the range of the budget. The room addition project that we hired them for was to remodel the kitchen and living room space at our house. We will be very happy to hire them again in the future. They are real professional people."
5,"We recently had a room addition built at our house. Our addition project started before the COVID-19 situation and it was managed by Oren, and we couldn’t have asked for more skilled and communicative contractor. From the beginning, he was with us, guiding us on how to plan out our addition that will fit our budget, and explaining us all the stages and processes involved. Oren set the timeline for the start of the construction, and what would be involved, and he also provided us with many ideas on best practices that would result in a highest end quality for our budget. The working teams were professional and always polite, and they were very receptive and responsive to any of our questions and issues we had. From A to Z, the addition project was perfect, and on target. We are very happy with the final results. We will definitely be calling up Oren for any future remodels, and we would not hesitate to recommend him to friends and family."
5,"Oren at SOD Home Group is highly recommended! He seriously was able to fix the problems of another contractor who decided to stop in the middle due to complicity of the project. Most of all he can do many things with a high degree of quality. This is HIGHLY recommended handyman! Thanks, Oren for all the great work you have done in my home and will definitely hire again."
5,"What a complete pleasure to work with! SOD Home Group were reasonable prices, efficient, honest and cared about my home. They did such an outstanding job! They were ON TIME and super knowledgeable.  We really love hosting our friends and family in our home, our kitchen was a separate room facing the backyard, so we had architectural plans made to add a large family room on the expense of our backyard, and open the kitchen to the new family room. It took SOD Home Group about 3 months to finish the job and we couldn’t be happier.  If you are looking for honest and talented contractors at fair prices, then SOD Home Group is exactly what you are looking for."
5,"Oren and his skilled team at SOD Home Group were the most professionals, polite and skilled people while Oren the contractor was such a great supervisor that we worked with during our large remodeling project that included the kitchen, bathrooms, and outdoor landscape project that was ended last week. The high quality and the installation of all the parts of the new kitchen were done as Oren promised to us and were finished exactly on time. Oren ideas and help were very useful from the layout design aspect. They made our dream kitchen a reality."
5,"Oren at SOD Home Group did a STUNNING remodeling job for us. We basically redid our entire first floor that included the kitchen, guest bathroom, living room and dining room area and all of it looks gorgeous. Oren and his team of people were easy, polite, and honest people to work with, super responsive, and very affordable related to everybody else. They also painted the entire spaces, installed washer dryer hookups and installed our new wood flooring. We will hire them for forthcoming projects. Can’t wait!"
5,"I only have the highest praises for Oren, and his work. From the beginning, Oren displayed so much warmth and sincerity towards us. From the first consultation, he gave tremendous time and detail to what we could anticipate if we were to hire him for our project, a full bathroom remodel. He was never in a rush, so open to conversation, and actively listened to what our expectations were for our project. Oren always carried himself with utmost professionalism, while establishing and maintaining a personal relationship, with constant, open and timely communication. The entire process was incredibly smooth. Oren gave us direction each step of the way, allowing us to choose our style and shop within our budget. Everything was done is a timely fashion and the project was finished so quickly! Every person involved in the project was professional, and we did not feel that our privacy was invaded at any point. We could not be happier with the final result of the bathroom. We would recommend Oren to anyone looking to do any remodeling or reconstruction, and would definitely work with him in the future! Thank you Oren!"
5,"I'm writing this review because me and my husband were very happy with the work that they did!. Oren is a great person to work with and we felt that he is a professional person that tries hard to make us happy by doing a lot of things that we never included in the job even. The workers also were happy and they mentioned several times that they want to do this bathroom remodeling project on the best side. the project that they did for us included the new floor and replacing the shower with a large bathtub with stone walls all over the tub. In addition to that, we replaced all the light fixtures and the outlets/switches as well. We love the new bathroom and we do recommend this company."
5,"We hired SOD Home Group to convert our upstairs living room into a fully permitted bedroom, and we cannot be happier with how everything went, including the remodeling process and the outcome results. We truly recommend asking for Oren as the assigned project manager. Oren is smart, very professional and super reliable man when it comes to construction, communication and execution. We had few setbacks during the remodeling work and Oren stood up during all of them placing our priorities and comments on the top. The working crew who was assigned and worked on our remodeling project were very well trained, clean, honest, and they completed the remodeling project on the time frame Oren and his office set that. We honestly know that If we will ever have another remodeling project to do… We will definitely contact and hire SOD Home Group and mainly Oren."
5,"We had an excellent experience with SOD Home Group with this current remodeling project. Oren and his team remodeled and upgraded the kitchen at my house. Oren was the project manager and he was absolutely amazing person, very helpful and pleasant, answered all of our questions and was able to save us some money with his valuable advises. The remodeling project went smoothly, and he finished all of it on the promised time and within agreed price. We love the new kitchen, looks beautiful!"
5,"SOD Home Group transformed our house into a stunning new look and feel. Each and Every part and detail of this complete remodeling project was way far exceeded all of our expectations. The honesty, high quality of work, trustworthiness of all the working team members were beyond superior. Oren’s communications skills were the main plus and that on top of the staff from the main office who gave us the perfect feeling that this project is being done at her house! They all made sure that each and every stage of the work will be done no less than perfect. A full 10 thumbs up we want to give them without thinking twice."
5,"We had a really horrible experience with the previous contractor that started our project… and just left it in the middle due to workers problems… we were so lost that we didn’t know what to do. When we were referred to SOD Home Group, we really hoped for at least a better experience. Now that our project is finished… all we can say is that it was amazing and we are extremely happy!! SOD Home Group really knows what they are doing, they took over the project, listened to our original ideas and vision and stepped in right away to do it the right way! our master bathroom and kitchen start to take shape very fast and they went above and beyond their promises just to please us and to deliver what we wanted. Everything was done in a professional way and in a very timely manner while making sure to keep us in the loop during the remodeling process. We will be calling SOD Home Group for any future remodeling projects we will have. They were amazing!"
5,"We could not be happier with our recently remodeled home and our experience with Oren and his team. Before embarking on our remodel, we talked to many different contractors and while we liked a lot of them, we felt that SOD Home Group was the only one giving us a truly honest assessment of what was possible and the cost of it all. From our first conversation with Oren, we had complete trust— something we didn’t feel with many of the other companies out there. He’s a perfectionist, and anything that was not to our liking in any way he immediately fixed. Any unforeseen problem was handled in a way that actually left us happier than we were before. Their attention to detail and quality is incredible, and it shows in the work they do. Oren and his team transformed our house into an incredible place, and it was a pleasure working with them."
5,"We’ve used SOD Home Group for two projects 1 year apart. The first time we hired them, it was for a full back landscaping project - design, irrigation, plantings. Oren did an amazing work, kept to the promised (upon) budget and finished the entire project as scheduled. We loved the yard and received many complements. This year we decided to build a new pool, which required all new landscaping work. This time around, in addition to having design, irrigation and planting needs, our ideas included fencing, benches, BBQ island as well with slopes and varying elevations. Oren was amazing and he pulled all of our ‘preferred’ and ‘want’ into a stunning design plan that met our budget and Oren and his team executed the design perfectly. Once again, in addition to the enjoyment we receive from our beautiful backyard, our friends and family have nothing but complements as well.  We highly recommend SOD Home Group."
5,We just finished our remodeling project with SOD Home Group who did a stunning remodeling work at our house by completely demolished the existing kitchen and to build the new designed one. Oren was the main person that we dealt with during the entire work and he made sure that everything will go according to the plan. He also managed all the people who worked at the house (close to 15 different people) while the office made sure that all the orders and deliveries will be handled in the most professional way. We wanted to have our new kitchen project finished before the new year and Oren promised that it will and we can write here that he did fulfill his promise. highly recommended company!
5,We hired them during the COVID-19 to remodel our kitchen and living room. Oren managed the remodeling project from start to finish while he MADE sure to follow all the safety measures including the cleaning after each day of work. the project took a little longer than we thought but we totally understand that. the delay caused due to the extra safety measured that they took. Highly recommended company mainly during this hard time.
5,"I can't say enough about how great SOD Home Group was to work with. I priced out kitchens everywhere and decided IKEA was the best product for the price, but was intimidated by the designing, and installing process. Once I discovered SOD Home Group I knew it would be helpful, but after going through the process, I can't imagine doing it without them. Their design was great and the detailed measurements, pictures and parts list were so important. Whenever people see our kitchen, I make sure to tell them about SOD Home Group as I believe they were such an integral part of making our kitchen reno successful. We saved thousands of dollars going with IKEA, so it was well worth the investment in SOD Home Group to make the process so much easier. Thank you SOD Home Group!"
5,"I found SOD Home Group and its team who managed by Oren to be a very experienced, knowledgeable and creative asset to the remodeling project of our kitchen, living room, laundry room and guest bathroom. During the work, Oren was available for all of our questions/concerns and he also helped us with all the issues that were raised up during the work and we are very satisfied with our beautiful new remodeling project."
5,"As a Realtor my responsibility is to my clients. When my sellers wanted to do improvements to their investment property in preparation for Sale we chose SOD Builders for the job they were AMAZING! they took all the headache out of the renovation they acquired the permits, offered insight to the design and materials and even when we hit budget snag they were able to accommodate David and his team were super professional and skilled. The property sold before ever hitting the market while under construction and was over our target price all cash 7 day close. Everybody was happy. Will definitely call on them when I have another project. And so should you."
5,"Oren at SOD Home Group was very professional and helpful from the early stage of the project all the way to end of it. The customer service that was given to me was impeccable. During the work, I had several adjustments and changes and Oren addressed all of them without questioning any of them. I would recommend SOD Home Group and Oren’s staffs in the future."
5,"After purchasing our second investment house, we wanted to update the house since it was still stuck in the in the old remodeling style. We did not know where to start or what to do and after a lot of research we were referred to SOD Home Group by a friend that did their entire house with them. We didn't know what to expect. After 30 mins of our meeting we were in love with David’s ideas and suggestions to improve the layout and finishes of our new kitchen, master bathroom and guest bathroom. He was very professional and spent almost 4 hours with us showing us his beautiful designs and completed projects from his previous clients. We decided to hire him and we are so happy that we did. David came up with an amazing 3D concept design (that looked much real then the actual spaces) for each space that we wanted to remodel. He managed the remodeling project from start to finish and with the final decoration of the home. Our house looks amazing and our kitchen is, now, huge and has an island to die for. Our master bathroom is like a high-end spa at a five-star hotel. We are really thankful to the team from SOD Home Group for making our home an amazing place for our family."
5,"SOD group was great to work with. We did our master bathroom remodel, full house carpet, and some special electrical work with them and it was a great experience from start to finish. They were on time and followed through with every promise. Doing the project during Covid added extra challenges and they were extremely, safe, responsible and respectful of our space. Their contractors were all excellent and also very respectful. We highly recommend them. Ben, Eden, and Micah were a fantastic team."
5,"Thank You Oren and the Team at SOD Home Group! We just completed our bathroom remodeling & we really love it each and every day! After our research that included several other companies, we decided to hire SOD Home Group. Oren told us all about the entire service that they provides, their past expertise in working with home projects, getting all the permits, design, materials and fixtures, electrical, through to the actual work and the final step of clean up. They seriously were able to handled it all! Oren was our main person that we worked with and he gave us a beautiful, modern bathroom design plans which was what we envisioned. Oren was really great person! He was there with us every step of the way. He answered all our questions (we really had many lol) because this was our first remodeling ever. The SOD Home Group team really took care of everything! We have already referred two couples who are looking to do complete remodeling of their houses."
5,"I highly recommend working with SOD Home Group. Our remodeling project included a complete kitchen remodeling, the removal of a wall, the removal and installation of new floors throughout the entire house, the replacement of the electrical rewiring, and several other upgrades to our old flip house. Oren and his team transformed the house into a stunning modern lovely place. Our old and ancient kitchen is now so beautiful, and we love using it and spend a lot of time cooking in it! we were continually impressed by the high quality of the work they did. The remodeling project was finished on time even though we had few numbers of difficulties along the work. All the workers came to work on time and were also very polite. Each time we asked any changes, touch-ups, or adjustments Oren returned to us right away to make sure we were pleased with the work. We also appreciate all the help they offered in making design options during the remodeling project. Overall, we had a wonderful experience working with Oren, and we will definitely hire SOD Home Group again for future projects!"
5,"We really IN LOVE with our kitchen. Oren and his team and office staff were artistic, clean, resourceful and respectful, and more than that – really true professionals. Oren met with us at our house and listened to what we wanted (and mainly needed) and offered many ideas/suggestions that we really appropriated. We now have a newly kitchen, very functional, warm, inviting and absolutely gorgeous kitchen that we wanted for a long time now! We had such a positive experience; I have recommended Oren and SOD Home Group to our friends."
5,"We interviewed and spoke to a lot of construction companies for our master bathroom and kitchen remodeling project and we ended up by hiring SOD Home Group.What a great and professional people of no less than sensational skilled people! We couldn’t be happier from the whole work that they did for us at our house. They were absolutely honest, fast phase, and very experience while they always kept guidance and advise us during the work which was fantastic, and huge plus. Oren, our project manager was wonderful! We are so happy with the final results of the work which was leading me to also have them redo my flooring.
Thanks a lot!"
5,"Oren and his crew from SOD renovated my house and they just complete the entire remodeling last week. The complete home remodeling that they did came out stunning and we are stunned by the way our house turned out. Oren managed and handled the whole remodeling project on a daily basis but…
a.He made sure that the project will be finished on time and within the budget
b.He made sure that each day the workers will have all they need in order to finish the daily and weekly tasks (and not before he personally inspected it)
c.He made sure that all the materials will be at the house at least 1 day before the workers will need them for the upcoming task.
We are so appreciative of the work that was done by the SOD teams and we are very comfortable to hire them again in the future for any additional remodeling that we may have."
5,"SOD Home Group is an excellent company, and we are confident that no other company in our country could have done a better remodeling job with our kitchen and first floor. Our remodeling project was supposed to be the kitchen space only, with a hardwood floor refinish and painting the walls. Working with Ezra, our project manager, and Oren, the designer, was very easy and productive. Ezra was extremely knowledgeable about the overall project and we are confident he did the best he could to provide us with accurate, and honest advices about the some issues when they came up. He earned our trust by consistently advocating on my behalf. He was very helpful and took pride in their work. Oren has a great eye for detail, a really heartening can-do attitude, and a hilarious amount of enthusiasm. She really knows design, and our house is significantly much more beautiful because we listened to him. SOD Home Group was great at communicating and has a good system for invoicing and change orders. They’re a steady, logic, and generally good construction company. We are confident any issues we had with them would have been issues with most other construction companies. Oren and Ezra definitely made an impression on my wife and I, and we would be happy to work with them in the future."
5,"We had a great experience working with SOD Home Group, our project manager Oren. The renovation was literally problem free (this is actually our second remodeling project so we knew that we will have some issues along the way but with this remodeling… all the problems were resolved fast and painlessly... we are very happy with how our remodeling project came out and we love using the beautiful and well-designed kitchen. We definitely recommend using SOD Home Group’s team and office staff because everything was made to fit our needs; it also went much faster than we thought it will be. We also loved that they were able to handle everything from A-Z including the cabinets, flooring, appliances and countertops and the price was reasonable for the quality of the products."
5,"For a while, we searched for a company that can remodel our kitchen and master bathroom. Our past experience with construction companies was ‘OK’ and we learned from our mistakes. SOD Home Group was recommended to us by some people who we know and they were very happy with Oren, his work and his team. From the idea to completion Oren was creative, skilled and professional person to have. Our challenge was that we were at home during the remodeling and we were very impressed by the preparation work that they did before the demolition started! The communication, care and dedication from the team was amazing. We were not used to this style of support from them! The result of the remodeling is what we really dreamed about, plus!"
5,"Oren, from SOD Home Group, remodeled our kitchen and all the upstairs bathrooms. He did an amazing job which included all the design elements that we really wanted, and he also came up with many great solutions to our initial wishes, all with wonderful style. The new kitchen is stunning and very practical. Now that we finish the work with them, we can say that Oren and his team are very trustful people and they can make anyone remodeling dreams come to life. Thanks, Oren for your amazing remodeling job!"
5,"From the planning stage, to the completion of all the permits from The building & safety department the remodeling project of our house… the work that was made by our contractor Oren (from SOD Home Group) was much more than just ‘excellent’. The results of all the spaces at our house (Kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms etc..) ended with a classy, very efficient, super comfortable 3 bedrooms 2.5 baths house with stunning rooms and beautiful features. Oren is a truly master contractor and his way of work made us fall in love with him."
5,"SOD Builders Group finished the conversion of our garage into a guest room that included a small kitchen, bathroom and living space. The remodeling project took 2.5 months and it was based on a daily basis work under the supervision of Oren and Odelia (from the office). Each stage started only after Oren personally visited our house and confirmed that the previous stage was complete. This way of work made our remodeling so easy, stress-less and easy. Shril on the other hands.... made sure that all the orders, delivers and invoicing will be no less than perfect and she made sure that everything will be ready for the teams at least 1 day before they will move to the next stage. 
Each week we had several conversations with Oren regarding the progress and we were in the loop at any time during the work.
we are very happy with SOD Builders Group and we will hire them again in the future."
5,"We want to thank SOD Home Group for all the hard work that they did at our house AND while we were out of the house while the work took place. Issac met with us several times before the work started and he handled the project like it was his house... he made sure that the teams will arrive to work each day and that the daily and weekly tasks will be completed while he inspects them personally. More than that he always informed us with all the details, pictures and videos about the work progress. We highly recommend SOD Home Group for any home remodeling project!!!!"
5,"We used SOD builders to completely remodel an old house. It ended up being a big project, and SOD/Oren was great to work with. They are very dedicated to making the customer happy. And while there was some delays and heartaches along the way (understandably for such a big project ), we are very happy with end result. What is more, they even came back a year later to fix some minor issues that had cropped up. That is amazing customer care. Thanks to Oren and Team."
5,"It's always a pleasure to work with SOD Builders. Oren's knowledge in the field is very impressive and he brings such an added value to each project. The SOD Builders team is a group of professionals, easy to communicate with and their attention to detail is impeccable. Oren's work ethics are rare to find nowadays; honesty, integrity, and quality. If he promises something, he will deliver on it. To say that I have been impressed with the level of service they provide their clients with will be an understatement. Our projects together always turned out to be a huge success with referrals from those clients. Therefore, I highly recommend SOD builders to homeowners who are looking to remodel their homes with peace of mind."
5,"We really love the new bathroom that was remodeled by Oren and his workers. We worked with Oren from start to finish and by doing that, we had no hassle or many people to talk to about anything related to the project at our house. The old bathroom was too old and we wanted to have a new look by replacing and installing everything including the new shower and floor. From the moment we signed and paid the initial payment, Oren made sure to take care of everything and only informed us with the relevant information including, the arrival of any delivery or to go and select the materials. The new bathroom was completed after 3 weeks of work and the last week of the work was to fix and correct the minor issues that we had."
5,"Our recent experience with SOD Builders was a long distance remodeling project relationship thing. We hired them for our project before we moved into the home (because we are out of state). As part of their work, they installed new floor around the entire house, totally remodeled the guest bathroom including some major upgrades to the master bathroom. Due to our situation, many of the design details were discussed and agreed over the phone and by emails while most of the remodeling work was even done without us visiting the house and seeing the progress. Oren definitely made this ‘almost’ stress and super difficult work entirely easy and nice. We had our total trust and confidence in them and the team that worked made us feel that we are in awesome hands during the process. The high quality work and the time frame that took them to finish the work…made us so pleased with the decision to hire them and we felt it right after we finally moved in. We recommend SOD Builders for their excellent services, high quality and also because they are truly a pleasure people and company to work with."
5,"SOD Builders was hired to remodel our house that we just purchased los Angeles area. We are very confident to recommend them because many different reasons but for the sake of this review… we’ll just mention some of them. 
- They were very dedicated to provide us with the required results of the work.
-They were multipurpose and flexible during the work even if it was a small modification that we wanted to do.
- They were open and honest with us about how long specific stages of the project will take.
- They were professional when it came to the designs and layout of the remodeling. Our project manager (Oren), the designer and the office were very involved in our project making for a unified project.
With the points above… our project turned out to be a stress free construction project. The remodeling was the main thing that turned our house into a new property. We are so happy with the new our and we can’t wait to hire them again in the future for a pool remodeling project. We are fully satisfied with  the beautiful work executed by SOD Builders!"
5,"We had a townhouse remodeled and it included all the upper and lower cabinets in the kitchen, master bathroom redesign and remodeled & guest bathroom downstairs with new marble counter tops,  faucets, double sinks, wall mirrors & recessed lights on top of new layer of paint and electrical work.  The whole remodeling project final costs was much less than we originally budgeted and it was finished much faster than we planned. Our biggest concern was that we couldn’t be there physically to oversee the daily work because we live in another city and we relied on the experience, honesty and professionalism of Oren, his team of people.  They both kept us up to date on the progress of the work & each day they sent us pictures of the work that was performed each day. We are happy with the ideas that they came up with during the work and we would highly recommend them.  Many thanks to the whole SOD Builders crew for an excellent remodeling job."
5,"SOD Builders gets my high score for being so skilled, honest and professional during the entire pool construction that we recently had at our house. We always talked about getting a nice pool, but we needed to have specific requirements before starting the work. The SOD Builders team made sure to stand behind certain standards prior taking on this pool project and this made us feel so comfortable and secure that we decided to hire them and moving forward. Within few months, Oren and the team had the pool construction complete and now it is really a proud project to see and use. We couldn’t asked for a better construction company than SOD Builders to design and build our dream pool. We highly recommend SOD Builders for anyone who is looking to bring a remodeling project to life."
5,"When I decided to go with SOD Builders, Oren and his team including the office staff did a great work by remodeling our kitchen (I must mention that this was not an easy remodeling project because of space issues). The kitchen space turned out to something that is gorgeous and super functional. On top of that, Oren helped me with the selection of all the materials.  me and my family really love the overall service at SOD Builders. they always were there for me, always answered to all my questions even when I had a problem during the work, Oren sent someone at night to fix the problem. I must mention that all of my questions/concerns were always answered in a timely and professional manner. I highly recommend SOD Builders for any kitchen remodeling project."
5,"We convert the garage into a guestroom that is 550 sq/ft in size. We hired Oren and his company at SOD Builders to do that after he was able to give us a great price on the materials and the labor. Oren was able to include all the items that we wanted to have in the space and this included a small closet, kitchen and bathroom. What we loved was the fact that Oren designed, estimated and executed everything including the paint colors and textures of the floor and he was able to bring us several samples with combinations of what we should do. The bedroom was remodeling was completed after 3 months and the end results are awesome."
5,"Oren at SOD Builders did a perfect work with the 4 bathrooms project at our house. Oren was professional and very polite to us and he had a lot of patience towards his workers and the vendors that worked as well. The bathrooms that we remodeled (Master bathroom, 1 guest bathroom and 1 jack and jill) included a long vanity with 2 sinks and faucets, New stone floor with nice design, Paint and all the hardware that installed on the doors, walls etc... The bathrooms that we have included a shower and bath tub. All of them have been included in the remodeling and we love the new look."
5,"We had such a wonderful experience with SOD Builders all the way from the design during the actual work  installation and final check list of our remodeling project with the team. Oren on the supervision side of the work were wonderful people when it came to ideas, planning and execution. The workers were superb and perfect problem-solvers. After the work was completed, Oren stayed in touch with us in order to be sure that we were very satisfied and happy with the complete work (kitchen, 2 bathrooms and the entry of the house). Highly recommend!"
5,"Oren at SOD builders came over to our house (we got his contact information from a coworker who just hired them for a large-scale remodeling project). he measured the kitchen and bathroom and took some pictures in order to generate a great design for the spaces. His design looks very nice and we hired him for this work. He brought also one of his workers to take a look and see if he would like to change or modify anything. 
the work was divided to sections:
1. demolition of the existing one
2. move some lights and outlets
3. patch and fix the walls
4. paint the kitchen 
5. install the cabinets
6. install all the lighting fixtures
7.install the counter tops, sink and faucet
8. install the appliances 
9. do some touch ups of the paint.
during the work, we had no issue with any of the employees. 
they did their work and made sure to move everything before work."
5,"We used SOD Builders for a remodeling project recently and I cannot recommend them highly enough. They did awesome work at all stages of the remodeling project, from drafting to design to the actual work. On top of that, they were very friendly and nice people to work with. My remodeling project included: New kitchen, new hardwood flooring and paint of the entire house, in addition to some minor bathroom updates. From the beginning, the design team made me feel at ease with their wonderful suggestions and attention to all the detail. Working with them really felt as a collaborative effort. They very open to my ideas, implementing the good ones and explaining the differences. In addition to designing the cabinetד, they helped me select all the appliances, flooring, paint. The team was top-notch. They were friendly, skilled, hardworking and excellent craftspeople. The whole remodeling project was completed within our budget and just a little bit over time… but that’s because we added more things during the work. Were thrilled with how things turned out!"
5,"We had the pleasure working with SOD Builders and the team. Our remodeling ended up much better than what we wanted. The remodeling involved tear down a wall, brand new kitchen, 2 bedrooms, the back entry of the house and also the front entrance. The office staff, the designer and the working people were very personable and easy people. We had the vision for the front entry and Oren with his team were able to build a mock up so we could feel how the final look will turn out. They always arrived to work on time, worked with the budget and provided wonderful recommendations when issues and problems came up. We will hire them again for all of our future remodeling projects."
5,"It was a pleasure to hire SOD Builders our big remodeling project at our main living house! We had no problems, issues, delays, of missing days during the work with any of the workers, supervisor (Oren) that worked at our house NOR with any of the office staff. The remodeling project that included the kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms and garage AND the outdoor kitchen came out nice and perfect and within 4 months from the day we hired them and the day the work got started! We are very happy, lucky and fortunate to have SOD builders at our house."
5,"We were happy with the estimate that we got from Oren about our guest bathroom, Kitchen, Garage and few other items at our house. Oren was nice to us during the remodeling and he communicated with us on each step of the remodeling. His workers and his supervisor came every day to work and they were nice people as well. Over all, The new bathroom looks good and nice and we are pleased with the quality of the work that SOD Builders did."
5,"I have hired SOD Builders on major repair and renovation project for my damaged house that got damaged after a fire damage. The customer service and attention that I got from this company and mainly from the actual people that worked at my house was outstanding and I would highly recommend them with my eyes closed to anyone that need to any remodel any house that have this type of damage. Here is with my own words of why and what they did at my house that caused me to write this review and recommendation about them: 
a.Honest & ethical: From the first time I called them till the moment the final payment was done, I noticed that all they care was to make sure to do the work on the best side and not to try and find reasons to earn more and more money. During the work itself, there were additional problems that were found and most of them were taken care of without even letting me know or to try and charge me for additional money.
b.Budget – The work was divided to 2 sections... section 1 was for the first time they arrived to my house and tried to save as much as possible things. And the second time was for the complete work that needed to be done in order to make the house as a living house. In both things, the amount that was set, was fixed and didn’t changed and more than that. On the second stage, the budget that was set didn’t raised or included any hidden charges.
c.On-time: They give realistic timeframes and realistic quotes. They may not the cheapest or fastest, but you can be sure and confident that they're costs will be reasonable and that they will complete the job without any hesitation or concern when they promise and within budget.
d.Great working skills and extremely ethical working people: The people at SOD Builders were able to provide me with excellent ideas about the new repairs. Because of the damages, I have the opportunity to redesign the kitchen mainly and the first floor of the house.
e.Great people! The company assigned to my house several people that did the actual work and they were managed and supervised by Oren. Oren was the most serious person that we dealt from the company and all he cared was to make sure that the work is being done on the most perfect side and without any problem. The rest of the people were excellent people."
5,"We were satisfied with our previous contractor who remodeled our master bathroom but this time he wasn’t available to do it due to some family reasons and we wanted to remodel the rest of the bathrooms including the kitchen so we started to make our research and to find a good contractor. Our neighbor hired SOD Builders recently and he showed us his remodeled bathroom and it was amazing so we asked for the phone number of SOD Builders. We called them and spoke to Christin who was very nice to us, she was able to schedule the meeting with Oren and to start the work within a week and a half after. The price was fair and we hired them. The remodeling project took 8 weeks, which was within a promised time frame. They did a very good job, and the quality of all the finished products were at highest level and it looks beautiful. We truly can’t ask for more. Very Professional contractor, We will recommend and hire their service again – for sure!"
5,"In one word,  WOW!
Oren Dagan and SOD Builders has far exceeded our expectations with their outstanding customer service, design team, and quality of work. They have been so wonderful to work within our home remodeling in Westlake Village. Their team has been prompt, patient, and professional in dealing with my wife and me in our crazy time. They have team, great eye for the most up to date trends and trades yet have been very practical in dealing with our budget and the fact we have four young children under the age of ten. The whole staff from top to field to the office has been great, and I would recommend them to anyone looking for the (one word) WOW experience."
5,"We had the privilege to work with Oren and the fantastic team of SOD Builders as we were building our new home in Palo Alto. Their talented architects, project manager, office stuff,  design team, site emplyees, and subcontractors covered all aspects and details of our new home. They created a caring friendship and with us as their clients and worked with us to achieve comprehensive coverage of all the details from the initial building plans to furnishings and accessories. Their design team took the time to review our lifestyle and really listened to our likes and dislikes, their production team communicate to us throw the app on a daily basis and were always there to make us feel safe and confident while demonstrating an unmatched customer service level to ""under promise and over deliver."" as Oren told us in the beginning.  They carefully worked alongside our family in the decision-making process resulting in an experience that exceeded our high expectations in the quality of craft and overall design, but they also came on a budget! 
 
They worked tirelessly to place neat and clean, hang pictures, accessorize beyond belief.
Their concierge team kept surprised us, make us feel special and unique, and at the same time, they made sure we are safe and on our side. The experience was beyond belief and could not have been more seamless as every consideration of detail was checked and rechecked. 
 
 Oren, Michal, Kathy, Rose Tomy, Mario and the entire team of SOD Builders, took our fantastic house and gave the welcoming, warm feel of a family home that we can be proud of. Our family is forever grateful for all their help and will not hesitate to use them again in the future. Thank you, family!"

The materials and final products used were high end and we are thrilled of the new look throughout our home. We really appreciate all the attention that was invested in all the details, the professionalism and the passion to accommodate our needs. We were treated with lots of respect and compassion as they always answered to each and every question we had AND they made lots of efforts to pleased us. Recently we called Oren to check and see if he can take care of an electrical problem that we had in our kitchen. Oren did not think twice to send his people and to provide us with a very fast service. We will call on Oren and his ‘Luxcess Home by SOD Builders’ crew again and again!"

2,"The company cancelled a scheduled appointment the day of without a call or email explanation, simply a calendar cancellation.  I was working from home in order to make the appointment. It wasn’t until I called that I was told their schedule was booked and that I’d need to reschedule. In the future a more considerate approach would be to call and explain the last minute cancellation then request for a reschedule."
5,"Luxcess Home by SOD Builders is such a great construction company with outstanding customer service and very high-end standards. All of their workers are very professional, skilled and well-mannered while Oren always was there for us to answer all of our questions, comments, concerns and ideas. After we finished our remodeling, we can say clearly that we definitely won’t hire anyone else ever for any remodeling that we may do in the future while we will keep recommend them to our friends, family and who ever we know. Bottom line is that they were the greatest team that we can ever imagine to work or be involved with."

For our recent purchased house, we needed to remodel our kitchen and living room. This remodeling was no less than our previous ones and we were not disappointed... Oren took care of everything that related to the remodeling, from the planning stages all the way to the execution of it. He placed a lot of attention to each and every step while focusing on the budget and schedule. We were amazed when we arrived home each night to see the progress and how they left the remodeling space clean. His team of people cleaned every day before they left the house. Each worker was professional and we didn’t have any major problem with any of them like many other people sometimes have. Oren was a complete pleasure person to work with. He earned our trust and business for any future remodeling projects that we will have. Thank you Oren for our remodeling and service."

Our kitchen remodeling was a complete remodeling that included all the upper and lower cabinets, sink, island and new hardwood floor. Other than the kitchen remodeling project, we also had them to remodel our 2 closets by installing a complete shelving units in each one of them. During the remodeling process Adam was polite and expert. He was on time at the house each day, worked around the set budget and made sure that no matter what, the work will be on schedule while ensuring that we were all in agreement with the designs and plans before any work will be done."
5,"We have hired and worked with Luxcess Home by SOD Builders on two projects at the same time. The first project was at our main house where we had them design and install new kitchen, new appliances, new coat of paint etc… and at the other house we had them remodel all the bathrooms. We truly loved how Gal and his professional team of people managed and executed the 2 projects. It was great to have them at our houses and to see the daily progress of the work. Gal is a very patient person with great sense of design imagination that knew how to bring our vision into a reality. During the work, Gal always able to give us his great advices so our remodeling projects will be much better and functional. His team of professional and office staff were amazing as well.

All the working crew including the office staff did amazing job and always kept the working space as organized and clean as they could mainly during the working days and also before they left for the day. They were honest, skilled, professionals and at the end, they completed the work on the agreed time."
5,"We used Luxcess Home by SOD Builders on our recent large scale remodeling project last month where we had them design and build our custom modern kitchen, completely remodel the laundry room and 2 bathrooms. The workmanship that they did for the whole remodeling was unbelievable. Everything came out completely wonderful... We can’t be happier with the results of our remodeling product. Thank you"
5,"After the several estimates that we got from several contractors to remodel our master bathroom and kitchen, we contacted Luxcess Home by SOD Builders to move forward and to finalize the estimate and do the work. Our project manager Gal was the main person that we dealt with and he was the one that generated the estimate and he was very responsive, reasonable and educated. Few days after we signed the agreement, the remodeling project started. The remodeling process was very fast and the work came out awesome. Our master bathroom and kitchen turned out so beautiful and functional. Gal and the team were wonderful. We definitely recommend them and we will hire them for any future remodeling projects."
5,"Great company to hire! Ehud and Oren worked with us at our remodeling project that included paint, Remove a wall, built a closet and install new floor at one of the bedrooms at our house. Ehud was the person that we dealt about what we want to do and Oren supervised the whole work with the workers that came over each day to the house. The work went pretty fast and the work that they did came out very nice and in good quality. We had no problem during the remodeling and Oren took care of all the concerns that we had."
5,"We had a great experience with Luxcess Home by SOD Builders... Before we started the conversion of our 2 car garage, we researched and shopped around for few months until we went ahead with Luxcess Home by SOD Builders. Because we are a picky people, we went physically to see several remodeling jobs that they did recently. We were impressed but also worried at the same time. Based on what we saw, we felt that our estimate will not fit our budget and that we will not be able to afford it. The sales rep delivered us the quote and spent 5 hours with us. He didn’t push us to sign the contract and more than that, he didn’t try to persuade us. We took all the information he gave us and few days after, we called him and agreed to talk over the weekend. Shortly after that day, we called him and scheduled the meeting at our house. The price for the work was fair and we felt that we are in good hands. We signed the agreement and a week after, the project started. We converted the garage (about 500 sq/ft) to an amazing single room including a bathroom & steam shower, small laundry area and a kitchen. Everything came out perfect. The additional unit blend well with the rest of the house and all of our friends including our family members that visited us after the work was completed, could not believe how nice the new space… They were able to deal with all the challenges that the project included and how the new hardwood floor installation was blended to the house as a one long hardwood floor Hallway .We are very happy with the results"
5,"My experience with Luxcess Home by SOD Builders was more than excellent. Our project manager Gal was professional, honest, full of ideas and a person that can be trust. We will definitely hire Luxcess Home by SOD Builders in the future for any additional remodeling projects. We have no complaints for any of the staff that was involved at our project. They all did a wonderful job learning our needs, requests and budget. During the work process, all of our concerns were addressed professionally."
5,"We are extremely satisfied with our new bathroom that was remodeled by Luxcess Home by SOD Builders. Oren supervised this remodeling project from start to end and during the entire time of the work, he listened very well to all of our comments and visions of what we wanted to have and get in the remodeling. Each stage of the work was planned with extra thought, causes and carried out on the best way it could be. The finished remodeling by far meets all of our goals, expectations and vision! Many thanks to all the people that were part of this work and we do recommend them to anyone."
5,"Gal came over and gave us a quote for a roof replacement. He also gave us an honest appraisal of possible additional work that the roof needed due to an existing water damage. At the end, we also did the additional work. Gal never pressured us or pushed us to any of the work and he was able to do the extra work at a very reasonable price. They started the roof project within the time frame that was promised by Gal and they finished it on time. Gal explained to us everything pretty well and he even made sure that we are happy with the new roof before he even asked for the balance. Luxcess Home by SOD Builders is absolutely a good company with skilled people!"
5,"Luxcess Home by SOD Builders worked at me house doing a big remodeling. I had to remodel 2 bathrooms &Kitchen. In addition to that, they installed new hardwood floor around the whole house. The new floor was an engineered floor. The bathrooms remodeling included everything from tiles, vanity, lights, shower and bath tub to paint and switches. The kitchen remodeling included all the new cabinets, island with counter top, new sink, appliances and counter top with back splash. The work was done by several teams of people that managed by the company and they did a great job! I had no issue with the people that worked at my house and more than that, I was in touch with only 1 person (Gal). This company was very professional, reliable and honest with me and I will hire them in the future."
5,"Luxcess Home by SOD Builders recently designed and finished our large addition and a remodeling project to our house. All the communications, professionalism, efforts and the high quality of the entire work were no less than perfect. The working crew that were involved in our work, were very skilled, kind, very dependable and polite. Avi was recommended to us by our friend who also used their services for their remodeling project by Luxcess Home by SOD Builders and since the work was completed, our family and friends keep given us a great feedback and comments about the work that was done! We will hire Avi and his team at Luxcess Home by SOD Builders again for any additional remodeling project we may have and we will continue to recommend and refer Luxcess Home by SOD Builders for any type of new construction & additions."
5,"After my research for a home improvement company I called and spoke to the office of Luxcess Home by SOD Builders. During the meeting with Adam, he presented to me some samples the work they did. My remodeling project was to do a room addition that will be used as an office. Adam was able to work around my budget and he included some free additions to the deals! Adam had a large crew to work on my project and he made sure that it will go according to the schedule plan that he designed for me. My new office was completed within a reasonable time frame (a little bit over the time due to some issues that raised during the work ad caused the delay) and Adam made sure to keep it within my budget (which was the best thing)."
5,"We have used Luxcess Home by SOD Builders for our roof repair (a year ago) and this year we decided to just do a complete re roof. Last year, Adam informed us that the repair will be a temporary solution and that this year will need to just replace it with new one. Our overall experience is much higher than just great! Adam was very professional the entire time of the work and very communicative. The customer service is perfect and all the billing system worked like a charm and without any issues. The installers were very professional and honest too. We will definitely referred them to our friends and family."
5,"We had Luxcess Home by SOD Builders redo our entire kitchen and master bathroom. All the crew including Adam (our project manager) were wonderful. Our kitchen was demolished and rebuild completely. Adam made sure that his vision of the new kitchen will include all the things that we wanted and that will remain within our budget. 
The master bathroom on the other hand got equipped with a jet shower system and it was gutted and remodeled in 1.5 weeks. Adam was very perfectionist and he made sure that everything will be done without any mistake or problem. We are highly recommend him and his team. They are skilled, honest and great people to hire. Our main tip is that once anyone will use Luxcess Home by SOD Builders they will never want to hire any other construction company!"
5,"Great contractor to work with. Adam delivered exactly what he promised and his workers did a great job. The kitchen that we did included almost everything from New floor to paint and a nice island too. The workers worked on a daily basis and each day there was something that we could see as progress.  The materials were selected from a collection of samples that Adam brought to us when he designed the kitchen on his computer. The new design that he did was very professional and included all the items that we wanted to have in the new kitchen. We had no problems with the workers as well. They came over each day and worked on the task that Adam gave them and Adam himself, came over several times per week to see how things are going."
5,Luxcess Home by SOD Builders recently finished two extensive home remodeling projects for us: the first one was our kitchen remodeling that was from the studs and up and then the upgrade of all our bathrooms including the master bathroom. Ehud’s skills and professionalism came into place when he was able to recommend us about any design alternatives would be the best for us including his experience background which allowed to make our new spaces to no less than a dream come true. Both remodeling projects were finished on time and in the agreed budget. We were so happy with the work that was done for us by Ehud and his people and we already referred him to our 2 neighbors in which they already hired them as well for their home remodeling projects.
5,"We are new to California and our new house needed to have a complete landscape designed from scratch. It was too much to think about this big project and how mainly to find the right person/company that can help us do the remodeling we wanted for our new house. We feel lucky that we were able to find Adam and Luxcess Home by SOD Builders! Adam and his perfect team ... were so professional to work with and they delivered us a gorgeous outdoor living space that by far exceeded what we imagined was doable. Our house was a pre-construction house and our yard was empty and we wanted execute our visions of a beautiful outdoor living space mainly because of the view. Adam was able to check and see that what we wanted is something that can be executed. He really listened to everything we said and wanted and we were are so happy of that.

5,"Luxcess Home by SOD Builders designed and remodeled my bathroom from start to finish. The bathroom project started with several meetings that we had before the actual work and Oren at Luxcess Home by SOD Builders was our main person that we dealt and worked with. The work started on the agreed day and it was completed few days after the due date that was set by Oren. The most important part besides all the rest was that Oren made sure to keep the final price exactly on the agreed budget! The new bathroom is much nicer and functional than what we had imagined. We surely valued the honesty, customer service and hardworking skills that we got from Luxcess Home by SOD Builders (mainly from Oren). From day 1, Oren listening to our ideas, vision and his expert assistance to the overall remodeling. We highly recommend Luxcess Home by SOD Builders and we plan on hire them again for our house."
5,"The people at Luxcess Home by SOD Builders can do every type of remodeling project you’d expect from a construction company -- they are very skilled, professional and with many years of experience. They offer many quality trades of projects and they are extremely responsive. To our opinion, what separate them from all the other ones out there is their creativity and vision. Our house project required many structural repairs, but mainly the kitchen which is absolutely the center of the house, we wanted not only to be functional, but also to be no less than a beautiful space. Luxcess Home by SOD Builders did it! Gal was our designer and she walked us through all the possibilities based on our ideas and brought them to life. We love the new kitchen! It’s definitely gorgeous and functional. We know that anyone could live in this new kitchen! Gal walked us through all of the important details that come up during our home improvement project. We are looking forward to hire them again soon for our bathroom remodeling!"
5,"Luxcess Home by SOD Builders and mainly Gal, did a wonderful remodeling job to our kitchen and bathrooms. We did our big search in order to find the right home remodeling company for us & we know that we found the perfect one. Luxcess Home by SOD Builders were not the cheapest one from all the estimates we got… but we know from the past that cheapest doesn’t mean the greatest. Gal & his crew at Luxcess Home by SOD Builders were professionals, honest, hardworking people and mainly detailed. They know very good their stuff & each one of them was really expert in his field. We had no clue how to the remodeling should go but Gal’s experience & skills proved to us to be highly effective. They were always on time, arrived to work each day & made sure to clean up at the end of each day. We noticed clearly their strength in being very detailed in any step of the work because we are a perfectionists people ourselves & absolutely not easy people to please. We are happy and pleased with this company’s performance. We are looking forward to hiring them again in the future. Thanks Gal!"
5,"I contacted Luxcess Home by SOD Builders for a master bathroom renovation with a tight budget. Starting at the day when I called them, I told them what I wanted to do and if they can come over to check the bathroom and to give me an estimate. Yossi was the person that came over to my house and he checked and asked me some questions in which showed me how skilled he is and when he presented me the quote… I was surprised that it fit by budget without even asking for discounts. Yossi was very understanding and he was able to send his crew to start working 2 days after due to the fact that they had another job completed just few blocks away from my house! The crew worked very carefully and Yossi made sure that the budget will stay as is and without any changes. I was amazed to see how the progress get along each and every day. More than all the above, I was very amazed that they finished the entire project earlier than Yossi initially quoted me. I am so thankful that I hired them for my bathroom remodeling project!"
5,"Ehud, was a real pleasure person to work with. We hired Ehud at Luxcess Home by SOD Builders to design and create an entire new outdoor living space including a pool. Ehud did a work that completely surpassed all of our dreams! He was very creative, wonderful vision, hardworking person and with great attention to details, which was very important (specifically for this size of a project)!! Ehud was at the house each and every step of the way, from the design stage all the way to the end of the project. He was well planned, expert, easygoing and very accommodating to all of our needs. If there was any issue or if we changed our mind on anything, he was right on it. We were very fascinated with his team as well. They were very respectful, careful and reliable and went out of their way to make us happy and satisfied. We highly recommend Ehud and Luxcess Home by SOD Builders. We very much in love with our new outdoor space flows. Thank you Ehud, we miss seeing you!"
5,"From our initial meeting with Oren & Adam from Luxcess Home by SOD Builders… we knew that we were dealing with a experienced, qualified and skilled team of people who could bring our dream pool into a reality. Everyone who was involved at our project really listened to our ideas and vision while their new design of how the new pool will look like was much more improved compare to our original concept. Oren is a wonderful project manager who managed an expert team and kept us completely informed in regards to the progress of the work and made all the adjustments hassle-free. Our new pool was completed within our budget and a little bit before the promised time and we truly enjoyed contributing in the makeover of our back yard. It was a real pleasure to have Oren, Adam and the team provide us with excellent service and a wonderful pool!"
5,"Overall the project went very well. We chose SOD Builders because their price was competitive, but more importantly their timeframe was quick. Our priority was the completion date because my wife is pregnant, and we needed the house to be move in ready before the baby arrived. The beginning design phase took longer than expected and made us nervous if the estimated completion date would be met. However once the project started and we were assigned our Project Manager Udi, everything moved quickly. Udi kicked ass. He was on top of scheduling crews at the house every day, inspections, and correcting minor changes my wife and I wanted. All said and done our house was completed on time. The project included full kitchen remodel, bath remodel, electrical, plumbing, hardwood/tile flooring, fireplace refacing, and paint throughout. From the beginning of demo to completion was 2 months which is an impressive turn around time for a full interior remodel. We pretty much have a new house to start a new family and we are very happy"
5,"The entire project that included so many item at my house was designed and managed by Gal of SOD builders, with a design that was created by input from me and installed by his several professional teams. The project contained the full remodeling of the kitchen, dining room and living room. All new cabinets (from diamond cabinets) were installed, red hardwood floors, custom cut marble counter tops, back splash, new appliances, under counter sink and all the rest of the items that required for this remodeling project. The entire remodeling work took about 7 weeks from beginning to end and I was able to live in the house during the whole work. The construction teams were so professional and reliable and made sure to do everything according to the plan while Gal managing and monitoring the daily and weekly tasks and making sure that they are coming out in perfect condition. They also made always sure to clean at the end of each day. At the end of the project, I must say that the project had a fabulous outcome and is certainly a top quality. I don't feel I could have had a better outcome from any other contractor. It was just great!!!!!"
5,They were on time and set us up exactly as we requested. We have been planning to expand our back yard and living space and now our new fire pit area makes everything flow completely into each other. We just love our new back yard!
5,"SOD builders is an excellence home remodeling company that for sure will works very hard for their clients! We have met with Adam on our large scale remodeling project at our new house that we recently purchased. In the past, we hired him on some remodeling projects and we were very happy with his work while this time is no difference and he was able to bring to life our vision and design. He was very committed to our project and we noticed how much he cares for everything. His work with his crew was very tight and it worked like a charm. No problem or issue was left alone during the work and each part of the work was ended only after he physically checked it and approved it. Our large scale remodeling was to remodel the kitchen, bedrooms and bathrooms. The kitchen needed to be redesigned and Adam came up with some great ideas that left the house in an open space design that each section of it was separate from the other one while in the meantime, there was no large walls that showed the separation. The work was completed after 2 months of a day by day work and each day, we had at least 6 people working together at the house, each one on a different section. We are very happy with the complete results of the work and we want to thank them all here in this review. Thank you Adam and everyone who was involved in our house remodeling."
5,"Allen at SOD builders done wonders at my home. I needed several projects to be done and I just could not decide where to start. I wanted to upgrade the kitchen and bathrooms and to upgrade the living room area. So I asked around all my friends & family for any referral and one of my friends, referred Allen to me. Because it was a big remodeling that involved a lot of money, I searched and checked about him and his company before hiring him and paid my hard-earned money. On my first meeting with Allen, I was the one that did most of the talking and he just listened and took his notes about my taste, goals and more... Allen helped me to prioritize what to start first which was a huge help to organize my thoughts and to understand that it is better to start with something but to do it on the best side. So after that meeting, I decided to remodel the living room, bathroom and kitchen area. Allen planned and helped me with all the stages of this work and he even went with me personally to select materials. The only minus thing that happened was that the finishing date did not end on the scheduled date (which is ok and normal for this size of remodeling). The quality of work, craftsmanship and perfection in the design & completion, on top of the service that I got was remarkable. I always got answers to my questions and comments. All the involved workers and sub-contractors came on time each day and never caused any problem. Allen had always found the time to pass by and check their work and progress. There were some problems during the work, but Allen and all the workers were there to address it right away and solve it. I know I could not achieve that results of my work with any other Company. So thank you Allen for the wonderful job & until the next remodeling."
5,"Oren and his skilled team of professionals made our dream remodeling of kitchen, living room and laundry room. From our first appointment with Oren, continued to the demolition stage all the way to the completion of the work, the whole team and involved people of SOD builders were expert, honest, highly motivated people and well organized. Any issue that was raised along the way… was addressed correctly and handled in a professional manner and we were always informed of the progress, deliveries and installations of our project. We must state that our remodeling project was also priced right and our price didn’t change during the remodeling. This was something very important for us and we are happy that it stayed that way. We felt like we were in great hands and we will definitely call on them again for any future projects."
5,"I have not had the pleasure of hiring Ehud at SOD builders for upgrading my landscape plantings, build a new fire pit with seating area, replace all the existing backyard floor with new stamp concrete one, Adding an awning system that will be useful during summer time and mainly to add a nice BBQ spot. I was very happy with SOD builders and I was a somehow concerned how this whole work will come out. After the first few days of the actual work, I knew that the work will be done on the best side and Ehud will deliver exactly what I wanted. My backyard is now done and it has never looked so beautiful than it is right now. Ehud did a wonderful job and his planning and understanding what I want was fully worth it! More than that, Ehud spent almost a week with us to find the right materials for this work and this part was the worst part BUT at the end… I appreciated all the time and affords that he put into this part of the work. Ehud was really on top of everything and he did so much just to see how I’m pleased and happy with the work and progress. All the people that did the actual work were easygoing, resourceful, and skilled and were willing to spend the extra time by making sure that perfection will be the right definition for the work they do and they always found the time to talk with me about issues or problems that happened. The cost for this awesome project was very reasonable. I do recommend anyone to hire and use SOD builders."
5,"During the years and each time we moved to a new house, we have hired many contractors and we did had satisfied results with most of them, so we knew what to look for when we need to hire a good contractor when we need one. SOD builders was one of the contractors that we hired in the past and we were very happy with them and they were top notch with excellent results. As soon as we hired them this time, the remodeling project passed all of our expectations. We hired them to remodel our backyard and kitchen including the replacement and installation of 5 windows that 1 of them required them to expand the wall in order to create a new balcony sliding door. Before the work started, Allen and the office staff ordered all the materials and they started the work like a week before they all arrived to the house. The first thing that started the work was the demolition of the existing spaces, framing, plumbing, electrical, new cabinets (upper and lower), lighting fixtures, stamp concrete on the back yard part, tile, drywall, new paint and the installation of all the appliances. They worked fast, professionally, and flawlessly. Every day we noticed a change in the progress and the workers came on time and they stayed until they finished the daily tasks. We never had any complaint or problem with anyone that was involved at the remodeling project. The new kitchen was completed on time, within the budget and in a professional manner. We love the new kitchen and the stamp concrete in the back yard!"
5,"When we hired SOD builders to remodel the kitchen at our house, we were told by the people who referred us to them that they would stay on schedule and for sure on budget. Since we had 1 bad experience with our previous contractor, we were hesitating to believe it. Adam and his sub-contractors were without any doubt the most skilled, honest, trusty and reliable people we have ever met. They were polite and respectful to the fact that we were living in the house during the work and they made sure we were ok with everything. The remodeling spaces were neatly cleaned at the end of every day and left as little dust as possible in the rest of the house. Everything they did, was approved by us prior (on a daily basis) to be sure we were all on the same page. All and any issue that came up during the work, were addressed right away in a professional way. Adam and his contractors are truly the best in terms of workmanship, reliability and honesty."
5,"We had our bathrooms remodeled by SOD builders just recently! Our master bathroom was the most major turnaround from all the other bathrooms that we did. Our supervisor Adam among his team of people with his sub-contractors, were professional and productive. Adam worked hand by hand with us to reach an amazing results. His ideas and participation along with our spoken requirements ended in a really overwhelming results. Adam was able to generate for us a before & after designs so we can fell the transformation of how it will be after the work is complete. The work was performed while we were living at the house and their work was not interfering our day to day things. They worked clean and they made sure to protect all the spaces to prevent any type of damages. The work was done in a continuous manner with Adam regularly checking all phases of the job as it advanced! Punctuality was a main feature with him! We would have no doubts in referring him to anyone looking for an honest and reliable contractor!"
5,"From the first consultation meeting that we had with Adam all the way to the final walk thru of the remodeling project that was done by him and his crew, Adam was a great person to work with. The work that he did for us (A complete kitchen remodeling, bathrooms remodeling, laundry room upgrade and the 2 car garage) was done in fairly time and with high standards of quality. Every one of the crew members made sure that their part in the work was done to the high standards of the rest of craftsmanship that was defined and managed by Adam. During the remodeling project, we were provided with all the relevant information including solutions to raised problems that came up and all of our questions were answered in a professionally manner. Now that our project is complete and after working with Adam at SOD builders, we are sure that our house will serve our needs for many more years to come."
5,"SOD builders just finished a major kitchen remodeling project for us. Adam removed all the old floor and replaced it with new ¾ hardwood floor. On top of that, he refaced all the kitchen cabinets, took down a wall including some cabinets that were between the kitchen and living room and added a new overhead beam. The old countertop was also removed and a new marble countertop have been installed and polished. The dishwasher was relocated and replaced with a new stainless steel one. In the electric part of the remodeling we relocate several electrical switches and outlets and installed an overhead exhaust fan. We are very pleased and satisfied with all the work that Adam and his people did for us. Adam is careful, easy person to talk to and he did his best to keep the functionality of the kitchen for us as much as he could during the remodel. Everyone appeared at the house on time and mainly were focused only on the project. The kitchen was completed on time, but only due to the fact that they also worked extra time on Sundays too just to stay on time! More than that, during the remodeling, we came across few problems with the plumbing and electricity, but Adam was on top of it with the electrician and plumber so those issues were solved at no time. Adam’s schedule is pretty full but now we know how worth is the wait. We will not think twice to hire them again. We are very proud to write this review!"
5,"We are very proud and happy to write this great review for Oren and the whole team at SOD builders! We decided to select SOD builders out of 6 other home improvement companies that we met and talked to in regards to our home remodeling project. We much mention here that the other 2 companies were too rough and pushy people that all they wanted is to just make the sale and to have us signed on the contact which was the reason why we ended up not hiring them. This type of work was a big no for us and never want to deal with this type of people or companies. Oren was the exact opposite from that and his approach was first to understand what we want and what is our vision in regards to the kitchen and bathrooms that we wanted to have. After he understood that, he provided us with his ideas that were in fact nothing less than improvements on that and this was enough for him to come up with a 3D design that reflected the entire concept. Our kitchen and bathrooms came out much better than the definition of ‘Stunning’ and this is exactly what we wanted to get from anyone that we hired for our house. All the workers came to our house each day and on time while focusing on perfection and daily tasks, stayed on the agreed budget and schedule! We WILL hire them again for sure in the future for any home improvement project that we may have. High recommendations and perfect references! Great office staff and supervision!"
5,"Based on my recent experience with Adam with my kitchen remodeling, I can only write that I will recommend SOD builders to everyone I know. Prior for me hiring them, I got 3 other estimates and Adam was definitely my guy from the moment we ended our second meeting about the project. Adam was quick, qualified and easygoing. Before I wanted to go ahead with my remodeling, I knew more or less what I want to do and how I would like it to be done. Adam was very communicative and patient during the meetings and he heard everything I wanted to do and need even though it wasn’t an easy task. My kitchen space is medium size and had a lot of potential. Adam was able to implement most of my things and mostly to fit it within my budget. During my remodeling, I wanted to do some things that were out of his comfort zone. Adam connected me with his vendor who was able to do them as well and I was very happy for that as well. If I could write any word for my experience with SOD builders and mainly Adam, it would be ""WONDERFUL""!"
5,"I hired SOD builders for designing and do all the construction work for the front and backyard of my new house. Avi and his team were professional, more than responsible and they put a lot of attention to details and perfection during the whole work. Avi was extremely communicative and reactive, he always answered all the questions I had and he worked with me hand by hand to design, plan and deliver all of the things that I wanted to have for my landscaping project. His team was regularly at the home from start to finish. And the entire team at SOD builders made no hesitation to make sure that I was happy and pleased with the work they did. The company kept stuck to my budget and any change that could increase that number, was conditioned to my approval. Avi showed me all the available options that I can have prior of me making any choices from hardscape to plant selection and placement of features. This is a really devotion and this company have honesty and they do look and care to make sure that customers comes first and primary before making the money.  The whole team were creative in a way that they passionately shaped the backyard from an empty lot and converted it into a gorgeous outdoor living space that perfectly work for my family and friends. I would recommend them for sure over and over again and I will hire them again when we need any additional work done!"
5,"We are very happy with our kitchen remodel that was remodeled by SOD builders and supervised by Allen! During the remodeling, we honestly enjoyed working hand by hand with Allen. Part of our meetings prior to hire them, Allen came over with a stunning design designed of the new kitchen and the design was very impressive and exactly as the real kitchen which we are so proud of. The entire crew of workers were involved in the remodeling of the kitchen and the breakfast area and they were great people to work with during the whole time. Allen guided us each step of the way with his knowledge and ability. We can't write here all the compliments we get about the kitchen from all the people that come over and how their face look when they open the doors and see it for the first time! We truly enjoy spending time in the kitchen and the breakfast area now. Thank You, Allen and crew!!!"
5,"We recently hired (Adam) SOD builders to do a complete kitchen renovation at our house which includes painting, replacing the existing floor with new marble floors (24”x24”) and to upgrade the electrical wires and adding outlets and switches. Adam was the project supervisor and he did an excellent job with his professional crew, supervision the project, managing the work schedule and handling the sub-contractors. As part of his work, he sent us a daily report/update. We both work full days during the week and we were thankful that we could lean on Adam for this remodeling project. He also quickly understood our vision and the style we wanted while he did the hard work by searching and finding all the accessories for this job (lighting, marble tiles, faucets, cabinet pulls, and more...) so they all will match and fit. During the work, he was cautious to our budget and helped us solving several scenarios of problems in order to make them fit into the budget. We know that the highlight of our work with Adam was when he found and designed the tile backsplash which came out stunning, and he found a way to make this tile work within our budget. We hope to do work with him in the future on our patio project!"
5,"We worked with Gal from SOD builders to remodeling our master bathroom. We were looking for someone that can guide and help us with good ideas and options and mainly to listen to what we want or need. Gal was able to deliver all of that and even more! At first, He met with us and listened to what we wanted to do and he gave us some great suggestions that at the end he was able to implement them throughout the entire remodeling. Gal communicated with us in an excellent way and he was easygoing even though we made some changes or we couldn’t make a decision. We are very happy with our new master bathroom and Dan was the one that helped and guidance us. During the remodeling, Gal with his team came to work every day and on time, kept us informed and were patient with us. They worked on the master bathroom as if they were working on their own houses. It was a great practice and we will work with Gal again including recommend them to anyone we know. We are very happy with the end result and the process of getting there."
5,"We hired Allen from SOD builders to remodel our master bedroom and bathroom in addition to a small remodeling of a Jack and Jill bathroom. All people in the working crew were enjoyable people to work with. They were professional, skilled and came over to the house each day and on time. We am very precise about how things need to be accurate and neat OR in other words, it is hard to meet our expectations especially in the remodeling aspect. At the end of the work, our expectations were met. Our special requirements do cost and it’s hard to find someone that can actually do it right, but overall Allen was able to achieve it in a realistic price considering the value of actual work and materials. Our 2 bathrooms and the master bedroom are gorgeous and we enjoy showing them to our family and friends. We would not hesitate to use Allen or any of his workers in the future. Great work and thank you."
5,"We found SOD builders while they were working on a remodeling project in another house on the neighborhood. During that work, I approached the supervisor Allen and we asked him to see the work. After we saw what did do and how beautiful it is, we asked him to pass by our house and to see what we want to do and to give us a quote for the work. We wanted to remodel the kitchen and bathroom and also to paint the entire house. Allen came over and saw our house. He then went back to his office and did his homework including a 3D design. Dew days after, he called us and set an additional meeting with us to show us his ideas and prices. The remodeling project started a week after we agreed and signed all the documents and it took them less than a month to complete it. Allen did a wonderful work and he was able to implement most of the things we wanted. The kitchen came out beautiful and very functional while the bathroom got his new look and design. The final touch was the paint of the house which gave us a brand new look of the entire house. The whole remodeling was done in a very professionally manner. Allen put a lot of attention to all the details of the work. Thanks to Allen and entire crew that worked including the office staff for making our house look great!"
5,"We couldn’t be happier with the remodeling job that was made for us by SOD builders, under the supervision of Ehud. Ehud met with us several times before we hired him and he talked with us till he understood completely our goals and what we were trying to achieve with our remodeling. Ehud really listened and helped us finalize our project so it will fit with our opportunities and budget. This approach of Ehud gave us more trust in him and it was different from other contractors that we met because their approach was too rough for us and we didn’t like it at all. Ehud was also very familiar with the city codes and regulations, which saved a lot of time in drawing up the designs and money as well. Based on our meetings with Ehud, the office staff was able to come up with a wonderful 3D design which included most of our things and all we needed to do was to give it few touches till it was exactly what we wanted. The remodeling team and the sub-contractors were also professionals and polite while they gave a lot of attention to our schedule and preferences. In general, the whole team deserves this great review for the quality of the work they did for us. Our remodeling project was now a large one, but the time and affords SOD builders put into it, made us feel as very special clients."
5,"We recently hired Gal at SOD builders for a complete renovation of our kitchen, 2 bathrooms and master bedroom. Besides the fact that Gal not only finished the entire renovation on time and on budget, but the quality of it was more than wonderful and beat by far our hopes. Gal and the whole team including the sub-contractors were so skilled and available during the work and made it easy for us to stay living at the house while they were working. They were mainly careful with everything and they cleaned the working space daily and made sure it will be as safe as possible, not just at the end of the work. The most and important thing was that Gal answered each and every question or concern we had during the work and he always made sure that we were happy with each and any task of the work as they were installed. More than that, Gal and his crew were able to deal very professionally with any of the several surprises that came up during the work and they solved them always with minimizing our stress. We truly in love with all the remodeling that they did and with the fact that it was such an easy and stressful process that we are already considering how and what we will remodel in our next project."
5,"Oren from SOD builders was hired to create our dream house. We renovated two bathrooms, added an additional bathroom & laundry room and installed hardwood floors in all the bedrooms. We worked mainly with Oren. Oren was always reachable and reactive. He was creative and unbelievable from the design stage all the way to the actual construction. All of their workers and sub-contractors were generous, respectful, hardworking people with high reliability. Their cabinet maker person did beautiful work and was a pleasure to work with. During the work, there was a mold behind the old cabinets and our concern was that it will cause a major delay with the work. Oren made sure to take care of it with one of his vendors and they were tremendously helpful by solving that problem and keeping the project on track. The mold problem was an addition in price but Oren was able to get us the best deal with the mold remediation. Now that the remodeling is over, we can say that a lots of extra things were done for us and without any additional charge. A lot of them were just being done without even asking us. Oren was able to finalize the remodeling under budget and a little bit early than expected. Our house was treated as if it was their own. We are very pleased with the remodeling they did in the interior aspect of our house that we are currently in advance stage to work with them on the backyard and pool. We highly recommend selecting SOD builders for any project."
5,"We hired SOD builders to create an outdoor patio living space on our home. Oren and his workers were professional, organized, and very polite, offered a project plan, had an on-site project manager (Oren), and a team of well-seasoned, personable and talented sub-contractors who had worked together for years. They were trustworthy and communicated well throughout the entire project. There were never any surprises to the budget process and all was well-documented and shared throughout the progress of our project. We were able to work together as a team, sharing ideas, making any adjustments, and the results are a gorgeous outdoor space for my family to enjoy. We have great respect for Oren and Jacob. And, here is another example of how they stand behind their work -they just contacted us for a follow up even though the work has been completed few months ago. They wanted to have a walk through the addition to review any issues that may have arisen over the year since construction was completed so they could be fixed. I don’t know any contractor that offer such things to his clients. We will use SOD builders for all the other renovations we plan to do in our home. We know they will exceed our expectations on those too!"
5,"The house that we purchased is very nice and was not maintained for a while before we purchased it. The kitchen and the two bathrooms were too old and needed to have a complete renovation. Although we knew that beforehand (since the property was below value), we didn’t fully grasp the extent. Our main concern was that we had a limited budget for any of the repairs that we wanted to do. We were afraid that the repairs that we want to do will be too expensive and much more above the amount that we could afford. However, after investing a great amount of time in research, we realized the budget can be stretched right if we will find the right contractor. We have called a several contractors to come by and to give us a proposal for the remodeling of the kitchen and the 2 bathrooms. SOD builders was by far the best estimate for the remodeling.  It was a little over our budget, but we were happy to put up the extra money because we really liked the designs they gave us. Signing with Oren was very easy and after that was done, Oren was able to start the work immediately within few days. Oren, was on site nearly every day making sure everything is going well and according to the plan. The work crew came in each day and even when the weather turned bad and was extremely hot. We were surprised to find how neatly they made the remodeling site. Each day when they finish the work for the day they would clean up and prepare the space for the next working day. This made it really easy to walk around my house without bumping into things! They installed brand new marble counter tops in the kitchen, new cabinets and floor tiles. The bathrooms got a new coat of paint, double sided vanity and counter top. All of it fit comfortably with our budget. Everything looks new and even better than the rest of the house. Hopefully that will be remodeled soon too, and when it does I will definitely hire SOD builders again!"
5,"We hired SOD builders to perform a big remodeling of our home. The team and the sub-contractors that did the actual work, were professional, dependable and knew exactly what to do under the supervision of Oren and his foreman. The work went smoothly (at least as we know) and they were able to complete the work on time and without increasing the original budget (which to us it means a lot because it shows how professional this company is). Every job in that scale, has problems and issues that coming up during the work and as soon as walls are being taken down and to our opinion, the main key is to have a good company that can deals with them as they were minor issues or problems (and this can be achieved only by really professional ones). SOD builder’s staff and mainly Oren, were always there to respond and/or to provide a solution for anything that came across during the work. We are extremely happy with the final results of this project and we will recommend them to anyone who would like to do a new construction project or just to remodel any part of their house."
5,"After meeting in person and interviewing 4 construction companies and general contractors, we went ahead and hired SOD builders to do a major remodeling project at our house. We selected Oren because he had a great vision for design while implementing our ideas and wish list into the actual remodeling. Oren was also gave us a fair price for that work and we felt that we are in a good hands. Oren was able to provide us a detailed budget and mainly to give us a good schedule time for our remodeling work based on what we wanted to have. During our meetings with Oren, he was able to help us decide about some difficult design issues. Our project foreman, Michael was very pleasant person to deal with. Michael and Oren were very communicative with us and were able to answer all the questions we had during the work and even before we start and while they were working at the house, we got from them a weekly updates on the progress of the project and of each stage of it. All the concerns or problems that came up during the work, were quickly solved. During the work, Oren brought to the house several subcontractors (like electrician, plumber etc…). All of them were nice people and all they wanted was to do their part on the best side and under the quality rules of Oren. The work was finished a little bit over the schedule time that was assigned by Oren but most important, it was under the budget! The house turned out to be so beautiful and much more pleasant to be in! We will hire Oren and his crew again and we will definitely refer them to anyone planning a remodel."
5,"After questioning several construction companies to repair and renew our kitchen we were very impressed with SOD builders and are glad we hired them. Before retaining SOD builders, we questioned and appraised estimates that we received from other possible contractors. Most of them weren’t able to work around our ideas and visions for the kitchen design. There was something lacking in His presentation or they didn’t represent His companies or themselves as professionals who were willing to hear us. Most of the plans were designed on kitchen remodeling prototypes containing cabinets mounted in a straight line. They didn't grasp the concept of our kitchen and the end result we were trying to achieve. Oren Harel changed all that. He presented himself as professional, honest, dedicated to provide us with an excellence product. His work just proved to be very reliable by doing so. Oren was always willing to listen, take his time to really understand our ideas and to help us come up with the right plan for our dream kitchen. It was obvious that his professional history and experience gave him the ability to imagine our own ‘vision’. He had the ability to start with the end product in mind. The original contract was well prepared, well offered, fully clarified and easy to understand. His demonstrations were professional and each stage of the remodeling project was exactly as described. His performance to meet that end was evident in the working relationship that he had with his subcontractors. All the subcontractors that were working with SOD builders Construction in our remodeling, were outstanding, professional and open-minded for every step of the way. We easily came to trust on the SOD builders’ capabilities. Any question or concern that surfaced, Oren was able to take care of it immediately. If a change was required, we reviewed the amendment before signing the updated proposal. All these acts took place prior to starting any part of work. Oren was a huge asset to us. He was compassionate about our condition. He was always on time, showed up when he said he would. He called when he said he would. Oren was working hand by hand with all the subcontractors. And seriously involved with each day’s work and he always was on top of the daily construction needs or necessities. Oren was the kind of person who was welcomed into our home. He was forward-looking at all times. He was creative, trustworthy, very qualified and true to his word. Once we started working with him, we knew that we had hired the right company/person. He did everything he said he was going to do. He didn’t cut any corner. We would trust SOD builders with any project and without reservation, recommend the company to anyone."
5,"I was very pleased with the work and service that was provided by Oren. Oren and his team of workers remodeled my master bedroom by replacing the carper, installing a custom fireplace, paint the room, and remodel the master bathroom by replacing all the tiles, vanity, fixtures and plumbing. Oren is very attentive to details and perfection. He did a great job by supervising his people on a daily basis. His total price was very competitive compared to other contractors and mainly there was no hidden charges at the end of the remodeling and his quality of work was exactly what I expected to get for my money! I will recommend him to family and friends as I have been getting a lot of compliments for the work he did. Before Oren start to work at my house, he brought many samples of materials such as tiles and paint and lots of pictures which made the process flow and very easily. Also, his staff were very consistent by making sure that all my needs have been met. He will be my first choice when I will decide to remodel my kitchen as my next project. Thank you Oren and SOD builders!!"
5,"Our kitchen was a bit too small and uncomfortable because of a separating wall that was between the kitchen to the dining area, so we wanted to make it bigger and lighter and mostly to have the feeling of open space that will enlarge the space since we have the long windows and sliding doors by the dining area.  This remodeling was set in my mind for a while so I needed to put it in action.  I was just afraid it wouldn't be what I have in mind but SOD builders remodeled it the way I really wanted and expected to have. The moment Oren took down the separation wall at the kitchen, the space become so much bigger with so much light. I also wanted to replace the tile with wood floor and on the walls to have a nice tiles as back splash. Oren was able to get a great deal for all the materials and the big light creamy color ceramic tile on the floor with a really nice design with some stainless steel appliances and light grey pieces on the walls. Everything was going to look way too nice comparing to the cabinets so new dark brown wood cabinets were done too. I love my kitchen now and will use them in near future for sure."
5,"When we hired Oren from SOD builders, we liked that we dealt directly with the owners and no unprofessional salesman who work for commission and keep trying to push in order to sign the contract now and add as many items as he could knowing that we don’t know much about construction. After we met with Oren and his supervisor at our house, their attitude and their interest to know what we would like to have and how we imagine our new kitchen to look like etc.… we felt very comfortable and we scheduled the second meeting so we can see the design of the new kitchen and what Oren included in the new kitchen in regards to storage space and appliances. I must admit that this guys (Oren and his supervisor David) are definitely professional people and they have a great level of understanding and listening!!! The new design included all the features that we wanted to have and the total price was near the budget that we set at the first meeting. They total price for kitchen remodeling was about 10%- 18% less than all other 3 contractors that came to our house in order to do the same kitchen that we did with SOD builders. The job was done in a record time, so clean, so smooth exactly as promised."
5,"I fully recommend SOD builders! Oren and his team completed two remodels for our home in Tehachapi. The first remodel included two custom bathrooms in 2014. The bathrooms were designed by Michelle (The designer in SOD builders); Michelle works on many projects with Oren. Michelle highly recommended Oren for top-notch quality. We found Oren's team to be extremely knowledgeable, professional, and trust-worthy. Although the project took a bit longer than anticipated, it was well worth the wait, as the results are impeccable! We worked with Michelle and Oren again in for this remodeling on a much larger remodeling which included gutting and totally renovating the kitchen, living room, and dining room, as well as new flooring and interior doors throughout the remainder of the house. Shawn, Oren's cabinet maker, custom-designed the quarter-sawn Oak cabinets - amazing attention to detail! Shawn, as well as all of Oren's team, are excellent craftsmen. Oren, the supervisor of our remodel, suggested we vault the living room ceilings --this was not in the original plans, however, these ceilings transformed the room without adding square footage. 
Oren's work is top-notch; you get what you pay for. Do it right the first time. We really love our new home, and we would highly recommend SOD builders and his team!"
5,"I wanted to take the time and to express my experience and appreciation of the work that was done with SOD builders. Few months ago, we decided that it was finally the time to remodel all the bathrooms at the house (3 in total). We search and looked either online or by asking our friends and family in case they know a company that is worth to hire. After several recommendations and good search results, we came across SOD builders and we were impressed by their online site and past projects. From what we saw and heard, we decided to call them and to get more information about what we want to do and to hopefully schedule a face to face meeting and to take it from there. To our house arrived Oren and he checked and saw what we would like to achieve and to get from the bathrooms and what is the budget that we can afford. The first meeting was very good and few days later, we got the estimate for the work and Oren asked to meet with us again in order to go over it and see what can be changed. Oren understood exactly what we wanted and he made us feel like I was in very good hands. He was firm, capable and skilled. We really love my new bathrooms and we hope to work with SOD builders in the future."
1,"They took our $1,000 deposit and never worked on our deck or kitchen.  They were going to build our deck then remodel our kitchen for $80k.  It didn't happen.  They were to work on our deck prior to out kitchen.      It took over 1 month for them to respond to us at all after giving them our deposit check for $1k.    We kept waiting and waiting for a response, but we never received anything from Adam (our project manager).
Adam came to our house, he was a great sales person.  He convinced us that a SOD Builder is a fantastic company.  My wife had a great rapport with Adam during the initial interview/quote.  She mentioned I would travel to his home country (Hungry) for work.   He was excited and asked me questions where I went and how I liked it.  He seemed very personal and trust worthy, and I was sold.
I cut them a check for $1k on April 1,2016 for a deposit.  It was cashed on April 15th, 2016.  
Adam promised they would start immediately and he would personally be in charge of the project and be able to start the week of April 11th.  We were so exited getting a new deck and remolded kitchen.   They signed us up for Buildetrend.com.  This was a way for us to see the progress of our remodel.  I thought we were in the right hands.
We sent all the prints for the deck and permits to Adam.  The prints for the kitchen and permit were in progress.
We scheduled a time Monday April 11th, for the foeman to come get an assessment on the Demo of our deck., since Adam was the project manager, we thought Adam was going to be there too.  But to our surprise, only Damien (subcontractor) and another 2 workers were there. 
Damien asked for the drawings that we gave to Adam.  I was shocked, why didn’t Adam (Project Manager) give Damien (Sub Contractor) plans for our deck?  Our architect gave the official prints to Adam?  I don’t have a copy.  I ran scrambling thru emails looking for some type of schematic.  I finally found it after 20 mins of looking.  our Architect came by 10 mins after.  Our Architect was also expecting the Sub-Contractor to have the blue prints.  This was totally unprofessional.  There was no communication between Adam and the Sub-Contractor. 
After Damien left, we were told by SOD via Karla,  that Adam would “oversee” the project from the office.  He will never be on Site, only for emergencies.  The interview was the last time I talked to Adam or receive and email from our “Project Manager”.  This was not conveyed to us as the owners.  I wish he would have mentioned it during the quoting process.  We didn’t even get Damien’s email address.
Back to the story.  Now Damien has the plans, no work for the rest of the week. We try to contact Adam, to get pricing on the wood.  No contact from Adam from Tuesday Apriil 12- Friday April 15.  
Monday April 18th rolls around, no work has been done on the Deck, no contact from Adam for pricing.    We try to contact Adam or anyone from SOD, but nothing.  No Contact from Adam from Monday April 18th – Friday April 22. 

Monday  April 25 rolls around this is the 3rd week, NOTHING  has been done to the Deck.  NO contact at again from Adam or SOD.  Monday April 25 – Tuesday April 26th.

Tuesday night, April 26th I’m so frustrated, I email again,  thru builder trend and finally Angie’s list.  Pleading to get some answers from Adam.  All I want is our deck to be started.  
On Wednesday morning of April 27, 2016, I finally get a response from SOD, but they say   “I know that Karla and Adam are working on getting the pricing for you. They are just trying to collect all the information they need in order to give you an accurate price.”  Why didn’t they call us at all for those 3 weeks?  NO contact, ignoring our emails.
Later in the day, Oren Dagan contacts us via Buildertrend.com.  He says he wants to start the project next week, but he wanted to know:
•Do you want us to start working on the kitchen at the same time.
•Do you have the permit ready for the kitchen?Is your architect going to do that?
•Do you have the engineering (if needed) drawing for the wall removal?
•Are you ok with us starting the deck already, before the kitchen or do you want it all in once?
•Can you provide me with few days that i can send the carpenter over?
•Have you chosen your appliances, fixtures, hardware and etc for the kitchen? do you need any help or list of items needed?

WTF!! We talked to Adam about this way in the beginning during the quote.  He took lots of notes. He even itemized all these items on the agreement that we signed.   It’s like we are starting all over again! All they wanted was their deposit from us. 

We were totally frustrated."
5,"Oren from SOD builders was our lead contractor for our complete home renovation. After the initial design that we got from the architect and speedy construction, Oren did a great job by helped us with design of floorings, bathrooms, light fixtures, countertops, marble and tile work. We know that it’s hard and rare to find a contractor that have the qualities and abilities that required to create the perfect project but also patient, supportive and highly determined to get the remodeling project done. Oren, the on-site contractor and supervisor, did an outstanding work. The rooms came out beautiful with open space, light and clearly creative while at the same token, fits to our style which is warm and personal. Because this was the first time we did a home remodeling, it was a big deal to us that Oren will be able to absorb our vision for our house in terms of its style, realism, beauty and potential. SOD builders was equal to the task! We basically love the new kitchen that Oren designed and implemented at the house, the high ceiling in the media room, the marble master suite, the light engineered wood flooring, the amazing molding and the guest bathroom. We know that many contractors or construction companies could built our house, but what SOD builders can offer is a passion for your home and a promise that they are equal to the task of fulfilling its promise in the absolute standard of honesty and integrity to which they clearly hold themselves."
5,"I hired SOD builders to bring the backyard finally to life. My house is a new construction house and the lot was mainly dirt. This project was a challenging one because of the uneven space and I wanted to extend it by removing part of the hill side of the back yard.
 After spoking with an office personal from SOD builders, for the initial meeting that I had with them, I met with Oren. Oren was able to provide me with 2 designs including an estimate for each one of them in order to help me get few ideas of what I can do and mainly the cost of the extended lot. 
My main goal was to had an outdoor kitchen that will include:
-BBQ area with nice seating table and chairs.
-Rounded fire pit that will be surrounded by a stone bench with pillows.
-Grass area.
-Outdoor patio that will be inside/outside seating. This was my main goal in this remodeling and the most important task.
My main concern was that during the past, I did some remodeling work and my experience with them was not good at all. In one of the cases, the contractor just left the site in the middle and never came back to finish the work. Luckily enough, this was not the case with SOD builders. Oren was particularly educated about this type of projects and he provided great recommendations. Sure enough, there were some problems and issues, but Oren solved them when they arrived and without involving us too much with the solutions. This could only happened when you have all this extensive experience with what you do and love to do. I was mainly fascinated with the hard working and ethic of the actual workers. I can state that they always came to work at the house on time, they were polite and made sure not to leave a mess after each working day. SOD builders did such an excellent job and each time I hear a good word from someone that visit my house, I feel much happier about SOD builders and MAINLY Oren."
5,"We used SOD builders, Inc. for our kitchen remodeling project. This remodeling included all the new and custom (upper and lower) cabinets with an island in the center of the kitchen that added so much beauty and functionality to the super strange kitchen layout. The quality of the wood cabinets is really great and high. Great thick wood, anti-slam doors, changeable shelves, modified doors, and even custom handles. Oren from SOD builders, Inc. installed all the counter tops that matched perfectly with the wood. The island that we did, was furnished with the under sink and wine cooler. The efficient recessed lights and the low voltage lights in the upper cabinets added so much functionality features to the kitchen which was excellent. The engineered wood flooring was installed by Oren’s workers in the kitchen after Oren helped me personally to get a great discount on from his vendor. And Last thing was the back-splash who also was installed beautifully. Oren is a remarkable contractor in the Los Angeles area. He provide outstanding customer service and deliver a great construction. He also have a very professional and great staff.  When I contacted Oren for the first time, I felt I was in good hands. He had an incredible attitude, and he arrived ready to the appointment. The remodeling project was managed in a fast pace and everything was remodeled with real knowledgeable specialists. Looking how the working crew was working on the kitchen was pretty substantial. They were very accurate, detailed and cared about quality. I was surprised to see the crew cleaning the site after finishing their daily work. At the end, we had a very good experience with Oren from SOD builders, Inc. and we are very pleased with the great work and final price. I highly recommend SOD builders, Inc. construction."
5,"Oren and his team from SOD builders were fantastic people to work and deal with for the remodeling project that they did at my house. They remodeled my kitchen, 2 bathrooms and the 2 bedrooms. In the kitchen we remodeled the whole kitchen by replacing the cabinets, counter top, back splash, lightings, sinks, appliances and all the hardware. Oren and the designer were able to design the kitchen completely on a set of 3D designs and they were able to do it as close as possible to the real thing. This design was a great feature that allow us to see how it will look in reality. The bathrooms were also designed and planned by Oren and his office. The bathrooms were demolished completely and Oren redesigned it completely by replacing the shower (in one of them) and the bath tub and shower in the other one. On top of that, He installed all the vanities, faucets, lights, outlets and floor. The bedrooms were the easy ones because all we did was the new paint, crown molding, closet and carpet. Oren made sure that the rooms will be ready first so we can live in the house while the other spaces are being remodeled. We noticed that Oren has a great attention for aesthetics, functionality and beauty, He always keeps the resale value of the house in mind just and he kept mentioning that to us in case we will thing to sell the house in the future. His communications skills added a great amount of trust and happiness and even the suggestions that he gave us in regards to the whole remodeling were a good plus. They were very patient with us during the selection process of all the materials, and even coming back multiple times when our little ones prevented us from being as efficient as we hoped. We've heard so many bad stories of contractors that either left in the middle or did a bad job that caused to redo all the work again. This was certainly not the case with SOD builders and the people there, they were efficient and even surprises happened, they did the work without any additional fees. The only increase that we had was when we decided to increase the work around the fireplace in the living room. We will recommend SOD builders to our friends and family, and we will show their work s referrals. We usually don’t give reviews, but they were worthy."
5,"I recently had the powder room at my house completed remodeled by Oren and his workers from SOD builders. The old powder room had so many issues and it was not functional enough to our needs. It was originally done by the original builder so Oren and his team had a few challenges on their hands due to the bad existing layout. Oren was able to address all the issues with the powder room by maximize the space and installing as many cabinets as he could and I am extremely pleased with the end results. His team of workers installed new drywall, fully sanded and painted the walls and ceiling with color combination that was recommended to me by Oren at one of our meetings before I hired them, they also fixed the plumbing and replaced some of the pipes, did a complete electrical work by adding several outlets and switches and installed the vanity, toilet, and tile flooring. Oren made sure to provide me each daily with any update on the project and he made sure I was happy with every detail and stage of the powder room. He was extremely patient and understood exactly what I wanted.  I am very particular about my home and I stressed to Oren how important it was for me to have every perfect. Oren understood and reassured me that he would make sure I was happy with the results. Oren and his team exceeded my expectations which is pretty hard to do. I recommend SOD builders for anyone looking for a quality contractor to remodel their home.  I will definitely be using SOD builders for future projects in my home."
5,"Hiring SOD builders and working with Oren was a great and smart decision to do. 
We recently did our huge kitchen transformation. The job included the removal of few walls, ceilings popcorn being removed, new plumbing, new lighting and outlets with some smart home features etc...The interview process was very intense and massive. We feel we interviewed a fairly amount of contractors (7)! We talked and met a variety of people/companies, from small to large. We called to each one and spoke to them over the phone and did a research about them making sure that they have valid license, insurance and bond. We talked to few secretaries that couldn’t say our names correctly even and made mistakes with the appointment schedules.  When we called Oren from SOD builders he (the owner) answered...huge and big advantage on the rest. Some of the contractors that visited our house for an estimate would either agree to all of our requests by saying, ""absolutely or of course"" yes we can knock down this wall and not worry about support.  And some of them kept telling me how they wanted to model our kitchen, not listening to our requests or ideas... Oren was a very straight to the point kind of guy and without any selling stories.  He told us we could knock down walls but be sure about any support beams that would have to stay or replaced.  The first day we talked through the design and all the financing options.  Since it was our first big project, we honestly didn’t have any idea about how much it could cost. The demolition was quick and clean. It took them only 2 days to complete this task. The working team were very nice to us and we got to know a lot about them. They made sure to use plastic covers every day and sweep up at the end of every day and made sure our house was livable. We ran into some of the beam support issues we mentioned above.  Oren came up with a great solution that caused us to redesign the kitchen look. Oren came up with a suitable layout that worked for us.  This actually changed the focal point of the kitchen and we loved the new look with this change. The project took a bit longer than we thought it would but was within the time frame that Oren promised us.  We could've had it done in less time but we wanted to take our time and to make sure that we are comfortable.  The final kitchen is really stunning. We can see that there was a lot love, care, special touch and craftsmanship into the smallest finishing details. Oren was on site almost every day.  If it wasn't him, then his foreman was.  He was equally as professional and committed as Oren was.  Oren saw every step all the way through and ensured no detail was over looked.  There was even a few details we asked for at the beginning of the project that we failed to remind him of that made its way into the final product.  We were really happy to see this. There were several of small problems and things that needed to be addressed after the project ended, but Oren was there.  He popped in to make sure all was still good.  He does this because the house needs a chance to settle in a bit.  He addressed them no problem. OVERALL EXCEPTIONAL JOB by Oren and his team at SOD builders.  We will definitely be working with him again!!!"
5,"We recently hired SOD builders for a few projects at the house. The remodeling project was including: 
-Adding a balcony Door and window from the bedroom to the patio/backyard, 
-Full complete bathroom remodeling. 
-New fireplace and mantel installation. 
-Re-tiling the entryway and the kitchen with dining area.  
 Oren and the workers definitely won our business after meeting us at the house and worked around our budget and they delivered exactly the results that we were hoping to get from them. Oren was very professional and knowledgably throughout the whole time of the remodeling and any issue that we had with anything, Oren was able correct it. He was also extremely helpful by explaining us how things would look after we had trouble visualizing few things, like the pattern of the tile. What really put them over the top in our book was that 3 weeks after… the remodeling was done. Oren called up to follow up (after the work was completed) and ask if everything was still to our satisfaction. I have noticed a few small gaps in the grout on the flashing around the shower but it never really bothered me too much.  But since he called, I mentioned this to him, and he sent one of his guys over to take care of it. Oren's worker also installed a new water regulator in the shower after the water pressure was too high after using it for a month. We are pleased with everything and would recommend to friends and would use them on future projects.

I have attached before and after photos of the fireplace and bathroom jobs, the work speaks for itself."
5,"We found SOD builders, after being frustrated in the past from other contractors. From the initial meeting that we had with Oren, we were impressed. Their values of customer satisfaction and their deliver everything they said. Oren was the manager of the work and he was on time for all the meetings that we had with him. He was very straight, kindly and motivated to be invited into our house. He came back and took all the measurements that he needed for the kitchen, asked us many questions about what we would like to include in the new kitchen and 3 days after, he brought us a 3D design for us to look at and see how it will most likely look like. It was exciting to see how fast they could generate a nice design. Oren knew what he’s doing and we were sure he has done this type of jobs many times before. Their prices are reasonable. We wanted our kitchen finished as soon as possible, so we agreed with Oren to start the following week. That gave us little time to buy all the appliances, hardware, countertops, tiles Etc… Oren personally went with us to 2 showrooms where we picked out our tiles and countertops. He also helped us to search and buy all the options for the (sink, faucet, hardware and more…). To be honest, I was probably a nightmare type of work. We moved out of our place during the month of the remodeling and we were a little worried that something would go wrong and we would end up on a terrifying remodeling show. Now after this remodeling is over, we can say clearly that is nothing to worry about when SOD builders are working at your house. Their workers was clean, friendly, willing to answer questions. I discovered that Oren visits the job site every few days, but he too sincerely cares about your home. He always called regarding the schedule, timeline or if there was a problem that need to be solved. We asked for changes to the electric wiring after the tiles have been installed. Would I recommend them to others? Absolutely yes. We will refer this company to all our friends."
5,"We would like to express our excellent experience with the remodeling of our house that was done by SOD builders and managed by Oren. Our recently completed full home remodeling that included:
-Master bedroom
-Master bathroom
-Hallway 
-Guest room remodeling
-Laundry room
The remodeling came out great and we are honestly enjoying each part of it due to the success of it. When we initially met with Oren in the beginning of this year, we discussed the first project which was to remodel the kitchen, laundry room and entry of the house. Prior to meeting with Oren, we met with several other contractors. Some were big companies that sent to us a salesman that tried to keep adding things and things that we didn’t need in order to make the estimate much bigger and with tons of promises that most likely can’t be fulfilled. What we knew from the past was, that in order to have the closest estimate as possible, we will need to have our own architect that will provide us with a fully detailed design of the work that we want to do and by that, we will know exactly what we need. Oren with his own expertise was able to see it and understand the design very easily and this was a real bonus and we could tell from our first meeting that he definitely brought much more to the table than the other contractors. What we didn’t know before Oren completed the remodeling, was how great his work will be and how efficient as well. We feel pretty much fortunate, as most of the time you hear horrible stories from people about construction. Oren and his team always kept us up to date and there was hardly a day when someone wasn’t at the house working. The team was trustworthy and competent, and we could always reach Oren and his staff at the office when we needed. For these reasons, we were very comfortable putting our second project in his hands. We would not hesitate to recommend Oren for any remodel or construction project. We thank him for making our home beautiful."
5,"From the first day I called SOD builders and met with Oren, I was impressed with their customer service very much and how they know to follow up everything. After talking to Oren over the phone and explaining to him my goals and what I would like to do, I knew instantly that this would be the company that I will hire to remodel my kitchen. Oren and Jacob, the owners are extremely knowledgeable And he know how to manage and handle every aspect of the remodeling, visit the house on a daily basis and perform regular checks about the progress of the remodeling and clearly not only takes pride in each and every work, but is knowledgeable and definitely involved in each step of the process. He, and his office manager Yael, and his interior designer, Rachael, guided me in all my decisions and made sure I stayed on budget and still get the most out of the needs in this remodeling without compromising any of the design elements I wanted and needed. The crew that were working under the supervision of Oren were hard workers and knew exactly what they need to do and they did it on the best side making sure that everything is in perfect finish. They were professionals and very polite. I have never dealt with workers like this before and I was extremely suppressed with them. In the bottom line, the new kitchen is beyond my expectations. We finished the remodeling of the new kitchen ahead of schedule and a little bit above budget (for some additions that we wanted to have and were not included in the initial estimate."
5,"At first, we wanted to remodel the kitchen at our house by our self, but we figured out that it will be so hard and complicated for us to even manage this type of a project so the best option was to hire a contractor instead and let him do it. This idea a great idea but the only challenge we had was that we wanted the kitchen to be done as soon as possible. We did our research through several online sites in order to find the “right contractor”. We were honestly impressed by the all the photos that we saw about SOD builders past projects and we decided to give them a call and to meet with them in order to determine if they are the right for us. In total, we interviewed 6 contractors (so frustrating and time consuming) and we looked over all the estimates that we got in order to compare them apple to apple and to scope the project. SOD builders estimate stood out because they were the one that reached out to us when we had all the hard and easy questions about the estimate. The kitchen space was the biggest issue because it supposed to be the main focal point in the house and the main space in our requirement in the remodeling. Oren had so many great ideas! He suggested us to tear down the wall that separating the living room from the kitchen. We loved this idea because it will give our home a big open space feeling AND connecting all rooms. At the end of the work, we were blown away by the new transformation. Oren listened to our ideas and he was able to incorporate all of them into the new design of the kitchen. All the work was done and completed on the time that we agreed before we signed the agreement with Oren. We couldn’t be happier with the way everything turned out. There is more work to be done in our home but we are holding off until things get more settled. SOD builder’s construction will be the first place we contact once we decide to move forward."
5,"I hired SOD builders for a 650 sq/ft. of living room addition. Before we hired them, we already had all the necessary plans on hand including all the secured building permits with the city. When it comes to workmanship and speed, I must admit that landmark construction was very fast while investing extra attention to perfection. All the teams of workers worked fast even when it came to fixes and adjustments. They replaced the wood floor with new engineered wood flooring, repainted the entire ceiling and one living room wall and blended new stucco on the exterior wall. The new addition required new foundation, framing, and window installation. We are thoroughly content with all the work that was completed by SOD builders. 
1)they made sure to cover everything all around the working area in order to prevent damages and extra work due to paint spots and dust from all the sanding. 
2)They came to work on a daily basis and few times they skipped work BUT they made sure to confirm that 2 days ahead. This was very responsible from them to do.
3)Oren the Project Manager was available and reached all the time. When he couldn’t talk or answered, he called within the hour.
In regards to pricing… the price that we got from SOD builders was in the middle range. Oren came over to the house several times to discuss about the details and the process of the project, and after that he start working on the estimate."
5,"I found this fantastic construction company almost by an accident, literary driving close by, and never regretted it. Few months ago I needed to renovate my kitchen and to make a very quick decisions on whom to hire to help with the design and with the actual construction. The personal at the company were very friendly and I was very lucky to find that my advisor, Oren, was available to take my kitchen remodeling project right away. We met a few times at my house, Oren explained me all details of all variations of the cabinets the company is working with, and I made my choice very quickly. The counter top was installed by another company that specialized in counter tops and Oren arranged a few meetings with the company without any delays and to my full satisfaction. The design part took very swift period and after few changes was approved and sent to production. The cabinets came directly from the factory on time and in good order and condition. Oren worked with workers, explaining them the details of the design and how it will need to look. We have chosen a contemporary cabinets for the new kitchen with several twists and new materials. By the end of the remodeling, the installation was very easy and painless, and I am very happy with the result.  I love the new kitchen and I would highly recommend Oren and SOD builders to anyone who needs high quality kitchen."
5,"I contacted SOD builders and spoke to Oren about what I would like to do at my house and what is my style and goals. Oren came over to my house on the day and time that we scheduled over the phone and he inspect the 2 bathrooms and kitchen. For a while we had major mold problems in the bathrooms and we start to have our concerns about it which caused us to do this remodeling ASAP. For this remodeling project, we spoke to few other contactors and we received few bids as well, but we still decided to go with SOD builders even though there was not big of a difference in the price, I was impressed with the way SOD builders and mainly with Oren. What caused that was the great communication that we had with him and his way of thinking and ideas. A week after the meeting and after we saw in details the design and estimate that Oren did for us, we signed the initial contract and we gave our approval to complete remodel the bathrooms and kitchen with Oren and his team and we set a date to start the work. The problem with mold that we had in the bathrooms, Oren brought his people to do the demolishing first and after that, they moved forward and start the construction. We were more than happy with the final results of the remodeling and we would recommend SOD builders to anybody we know. For us the total cost was the main issue that we have and after that was the communication. SOD builders was the only company that was able to work with us about the price and during the work, He made sure to stay in touch each few days with us throughout the remodel. Once again, Oren, Leslie and the actual people that did the remodeling were all outstanding. Everybody that worked on our home was friendly, very knowledgeable, and took great care in the work they did."
5,"I was referred to SOD builders by a neighbor who had a driveway installed. I had an old concrete backyard and old bricks on the front of my house. I met with Oren after I spoke and got the basic information from the office staff about how they work. 
Oren was able to present me so many available options for my backyard, front walkway, drains and chimney. His estimate included various options I could choose from and he was very fair. Oren was able to meet with me at one of his suppliers in Ventura and he helped me to select the pavers for the house. He was able to share his experience with the different types of products. 
Oren made sure to keep in touch by either calling or texting every day during the project and introduced me to Jacob who was the foreman. Both of them were extremely valuable as anytime there was a decision in cutting a paver, or locating a drain they provided their experience to make the best decision for my specific job. The crew worked hard all day, and cleaned up the debris on a regular basis. 
I am very happy with the job they did at the back of my house and in the front. The new look of the house is completely different now. I am considering another project on the side of my house, and there is no hesitation at all about who will I hire for that job. I will definitely hire SOD builders. I highly recommend them."
5,"We recently hired SOD builders and their crew of workers to design and remodel my new master bedroom that included the master bathroom as well for our house. Prior to the remodeling, I researched and met with three other contractors and designers and asked them for an estimate and referrals for that job and after meeting with all of them, I knew that Oren from SOD builders was the right contractor for me. Oren was extremely creative, honest and open minded person that cares a lot about the project from the begging of the work till the end. Before the work started and during the process of finding the right one, I was concerning is I do the right decision and what will happened if… to start this work, but after the work started and Oren start to appear at my house and supervised the actual work, all my fears and concerns vanish and it was a really smooth process. Oren and his team communicated with me before, during and after each stage of the work to make sure everything went smoothly and without any mistakes and more than that, he went above and beyond a lot of things that weren’t included to make sure that I get exactly what I wanted. Oren even went with me to select, buy and pick up all of the items that I needed for the project including the floors, paint, crown moldings, fixtures, stones for the vanities, doors etc.  He even helped me to make the final look as I always wanted. Things happened when he said they would happen and there weren't any big surprises or hiccups along the way. They completed the project on time AND MAINLY on the budget which was the biggest factor and fear in this whole work."
5,"I am so happy I choose SOD builders for my bathroom remodeling project at my house. During the years, I heard so many people's nightmare with contractors that caused me to do a triple search for a good company that can come and do the work without any hidden charges, and mainly to be able to complete the work. I was pretty nervous about the remodeling. After 5 estimates and meetings with contractors, I decided to go with SOD builders after my research about them showed me that they are a good company and that they are in business for a long time already. Oren was the project manager, He was very helpful, super nice and professional. I am kind of a picky person, and he was very patient with me. He came to my house or call me every day and check to make sure I am happy with every step on the way. Oren and his team worked six days a week, came on time, clean up every day. When they left, they made sure to keep the rest of the house as clean as possible. Now after my bathroom remodeling is completed, I have a beautiful new bathroom to enjoy. I am very happy with it! I absolutely recommend SOD builders. Remember to ask for Oren, you will not be disappointed."
5,"I just completed my full home remodeling that included the kitchen 3 bathrooms, Dining room and 2 bedrooms. SOD builders was the best construction company that I've worked with. Oren and his team of professionals were good with communication (they returned all my phone calls and emails within the same day of the following day) and were responsive to all our request, questions, ideas, thoughts and changes mainly when they start to open walls. They are fully licensed, bonded and insured contractors and came up with the proper paperwork to prove it. The initial pricing was competitive and logic while the add-ons we had during the work were very well priced. The kitchen remodeling included basically everything from new floor and new cabinets to new paint and island in the middle. The bathrooms were also remodeled and they needed to have new shower, vanities, plumbing and paint as well, and the bedrooms needed new paint and carpet with cabinets for the closets. 
The working crew and some in home vendors were on-time and at full size throughout the remodel. Jacob, the foreman, was great person to work and deal with. He came up with some great suggestions and ideas for changes that really improved the final work and few of them even made the work a bit cheaper and saved us money. The quality of the whole remodeling was more than excellent. It was completed on-time (2 months from start to finish) and on-budget – which was the main important thing in this whole work. The final items were addressed in a timely manner to our complete satisfaction. We've already recommended him to a friend and would highly recommend this company to anyone doing home remodeling. It was a pleasure working with them and when we finally decide how we want the living room lighting I'll have them back to do the work!"

5,"When I and my partner moved into the same house, we instantly realized that we will have to make several improvements in order to fit the house for both of us. The first thing that we had was the tiny sink in the master bathroom and the shower. This master bathroom was the first thing that we needed to do.  In addition to that there was not enough space for the both of us. We also had some plans in mind for this bathroom bedroom closet in order to make it as a walk-in closets. Once we agreed to a master bathroom and closet remodeling, we met with Oren from SOD builders and when he came over, he looked and took it from there. As part of our meeting with Oren. We brought up the idea about remodeling the kitchen, bedroom and to do the hardscape in the back and front of the house. By adding all of this as a one big deal, Oren and his workers were able to do much better work than what we thought to get. The bedroom is the master bedroom at the house and Oren redesigned it and gave it a completely new look and feel.  In the hardscape part of the house, Michelle (the designer of the company) came up with a brilliant concept of how it can be and the sketch of her design caught our attention immediately. Her design included all the new plants, trees, Stamp concrete and outdoor small kitchen with BBQ that included a bar, seating area and a fire pit. 
In the front of the house, she was able to design new entry to the house and several steps with nice rocks and tropical trees. The deal that we got from Oren, was very good and we took it. We were able to live at the house while they worked there and it was not as bad as we thought it will be. Oren made sure to concentrate at the house first and to do all the dirty work in all the spaces and then to do all the outdoor items. The work was completed after 3 months of work and without any major problem. The office communicated with us during the whole project and it made it easy and comfortable. If you're nervous about hiring a contractor, don't be! You just need to follow our advice and feel free to contact SOD builders."
5,"The work that we needed to do was kind of big. We had to interview several companies prior to execute the work. When we met Avi from SOD builders, we were kind of worried about what will he say or recommend us to do. Our thoughts were not good! Avi was pretty experienced with this type of projects. He was able to show us several projects that he did in the past and we were able to confirm them. The work that took more than 3 months, was pretty intense.  There were people each day working on the house. The roof people, the kitchen workers, and the windows. During all the time of the work, we met with Avi several times when we had to see and check all the plans prior to have them done. Avi was able to explain to us everything about the work. There was not a day that the workers missed to come over. The whole project went without any problem. All permits were taken care of by Avi and all we took care of were the payments. The price that we got from them was a little bit less than all the other estimates that we got."
5,"We remodeled our medium size kitchen (approximately 15 ft by 20 ft) that included new paint, new floor, lighting fixtures, Counter top and sink. The work was performed by Avi and his 4 workers. Avi worked hand by hand with them and made sure that our kitchen will be completed as we wanted. The work was divided by several sections. The first section was the demolition in which the workers removed the old kitchen including the drywalls and after that, was the installation of all the new lightings and cabinets. We were happy with the fact that Avi ordered all the materials for the kitchen and we only had to select the colors and types from the big selection of samples that Avi present us. The new kitchen was completed after 4 weeks when originally Avi promised us that it will be longer than that. His workers came to work each day and worked till late hours. We will recommend Avi to our friends and we are very happy with the new kitchen that he built for us."
5,"Avi from SOD builders was fantastic from start to finish of my remodeling project. He met me at the property several times to get a more detailed proposal together. He was informative, good communicator and honest. You know those types of contractors that just end up doing the bare minimum and still end up taking twice the amount of time they ""estimated?"" Avi doesn't that way. I unfortunately didn't choose him for our investment property but wish I had. The contractor I ended up choosing came from a personal reference and we had a good rapport but ended up doing exactly what I said above. Taking twice as long (a little bit of extra, unexpected work, and bad time management and perhaps scattered with a little lazy), and going over budget. Avi on the other hand I believe, from his detailed analysis of every little thing gave me the confidence that he would've finished near to the estimated completion time and would have done so responsibly and with enough detail that I wouldn't feel compelled to go back and go through every little thing to ensure I got my money's worth. During the whole remodeling at the house that included new floor, paint, lighting fixtures, closets and carpet Avi was there to make sure that everything is good and going according to the plan. Avi made sure also that the workers will cover all the things that they won’t replace so they will be protected while they were working."
5,"This is the second time that we use this company for a project at our house. A while back we used them in our previous house and we liked the way they worked, their price and the end results of the work that they did. This time was not difference. Out initial meeting was with Oren. He came to our house on the day and time that we scheduled ahead of time. When he came over, he looked at the bathroom and came up with some nice recommendations and ideas that can still fit in our budget and be nice. The bathroom includes: paint, vanity, Floor and shower. The massive work took over 2 weeks. Each day, Oren made sure to come over with his team of workers (3-4 each day) and to guide them on how things need to be done and what has been done since the last time he visited our house. The total amount was very fair and we didn't have any changes or hidden charges at all."
5,"SOD builders did a room addition to our house, it was clear that additions are their specialty. This is our first time remodeling so we were new to the process, Daniel, our project manager took a special care of everything that was involved in this addition from revising the plans, helping in choosing the final materials, purchasing them and making sure that they will arrive to the house on time so all the workers will keep working without stopping due to missing materials. The whole work went smoothly and without any problem. We are honestly and fully satisfied with the end results and we are so happy that we hired them. The workers arrived to the house always on time and didn’t miss any day during the work, they were honest and open to any idea that we had and answered to all of our questions when we had them. We knew we wanted to add another bedroom to our house but were not really sure about the specifics. Daniel shared his ideas while working with ours, Daniel and the workers truly know how to work with their customers which made this whole experience so much easier. In the past, we heard horrible stories in the past about companies surprising customers with hidden fees which results in paying more for the project than originally planned. The price we agreed on was the same from beginning to end. If you are looking for a trustworthy and dedicated company then we recommend SOD builders 100%"
5,"We highly recommend SOD Builders!  Extremely professional, competent and hard working.  Oren was extremely patient with us as we tried to work out how to get the kitchen of our dreams within our budget.  He genuinely wanted us to be 100% happy with the design before we committed.  The price Oren gave us was very competitive and included an interior designer, Carmit Oron, who pulled a beautiful, functional design together that is perfect for our busy family.  Oren made everything so stress free for us, he took care of all the details of the building permit and project management.
The workers turned up at our house on the set date and from then on we had workers in the house most days.  If they couldn’t make a day in the week they asked if it would be okay to come at the weekend.  They were reliable, polite, friendly and very tidy, putting up plastic screens to protect the house from dust and sweeping at the end of the day. We were connected to the whole team with the BuilderTrend App, this was invaluable as my husband and I both work and it allowed them to communicate with us and send photos of the progress.  Oren checked in with us regularly and and answered emails 24/7, always with his goal of us being happy, nothing was ever too big a problem.
We are so happy with our kitchen and I will be calling SOD to do our next projects.  Truly a first class construction company with exceptional customer service!  Calling SOD was the best decision I made!  I love my kitchen!"
5,"I contacted SOD builders to see what it will require to remodel my kitchen. At first I spoke to Michelle who was very nice and polite to me over the phone and she asked me some basic question in order to understand what my goals are. After that phone conversation, she asked me if I would like to schedule a meeting with Oren. The meeting was scheduled for the following week and Oren arrived to my house on the time frame that Michelle gave me (she was kind enough to even call me an hour before to make sure that I’m home and to inform me that Oren was on the way). The meeting with Oren was very good. Oren was able to provide me with good samples of cabinets, Floor and paint colors combinations. His main goal on that meeting was to see the existing kitchen and to get some measurements of the space in order to maximize the space. At the end of the meeting, Oren and I scheduled another meeting in order to present to me a 3D design of how the new kitchen will look like and how much will it cost me (even though I mentioned my max budget at the first meeting). The second meeting was very good as well. Oren presented to me the kitchen design that showed me how the new kitchen will look like and I was very impressed. After finalizing all the estimate, materials, colors and the price, Oren went back to his office in order to generate a schedule work plan so I will know what and when my new kitchen will be ready. The work went pretty smooth and it went according to the schedule plan that Oren did. The workers were nice and polite as well and Oren visited the house almost every day to make sure that the work is going according to plan. A month and a half after, my kitchen was completed and it came out even better than the one that I saw in the design."
5,"Very good company and people to work with! Originally we were interesting in removing a wall in the dining room area that will show a bigger open space. We spoke to several companies and we came across SOD builders. We loved the fact that they are having multiple offices with lots of years of experience and that in our initial meeting, we were able to get all the answers for our questions and the ideas that could improve our house. Oren, is a great communicator person and he has a good amount of knowledge when it comes to remodeling and design. He met with us several times and he also was able to give us a price that was very comparable to the other ones we got. The work started with the removal of the wall and it continued from there to the kitchen and bathrooms. We rebuild the space for the bath tub prior to the new installation of it and floor. We couldn't have been more pleased! Oren did expert work, very cleaned and detailed. They worked up daily and they were so nice and pleasant people.  We are so thrilled with this bathroom.  We had no idea it would look so nice... I can't recommend this company enough. SOD builders is the one stop shop place... they provide everything that you will need for the job.  If you are looking to upgrade or remodel your bath or kitchen, go with them!"
5,"We hired SOD BUILDERS, as the first project we decided to NOT complete ourselves due to some difficulties that came up and it was too much for us. We’re typically DIY-er’s and we are pretty good at it (if we do say so). Our kitchen project was much larger in scope than we could tackle and a friend recently had SOD BUILDERS complete their kitchen. We didn’t shop around and we trusted on our friend recommendation and we also saw the finished kitchen that they did. Our initial meeting with Oren, just gave us all the information we needed in order to give the approval for this project. We were paired up with Oren, who visited our home, listened to our ideas and took them to the next level. His details and space planning expertise was good & complemented by Juan to help select finishes. This was also the first time I put my trust in others to select or at least to help us with finding finishes and materials. Their pricing for this project was reasonable and worthy, the project management and coordination was painless and the overall results are stunning."
5,"My husband and I purchased our home in last year that needed of lot of remodeling.  The house was in a very bad condition and it needed to be fully renovated. From our past experience, we knew how the process was going but we were fully committed to finding the right contractor for this and to get this renovation project going and complete. It pretty sad to see that no one in my family, friends or neighbors were able to refer someone they had used in the past because they had such a bad experience during or after the remodeling. We interviewed pretty much a lot of contractors but we must say that Eran from SOD builders was the most honest and pleasant contractor we've met from all the other ones. From the very beginning he told us what to expect and what we need to do before hiring ‘A’ contractor. He initially told us we need an architect to change the structure and layout of the house. We tried to differ from his advice but we realized he was right about hiring the architect. We needed an architect to legally change the structure and layout of our house. Eran invested time to gain our trust by presenting to us some of his previous jobs for reference. His estimate (SOD builders) was not extremely low which means his work was not low quality but it was not extremely high either. it was in the middle!  We believe his price was very fair and reasonable for all the amount of work we required. Now after the work is completes, I can write that I am very happy we decided to hire him for this project. 
From the moment Eran took over this project, his team has made this process a lot easier for us. they completed the demolition of our home in 4 days which was impressive! They began by leveling out the floors and created the new layout of our home right after. They were knowledgeable, well experienced and they followed all the steps and stages in the plans. Everything that was on paper was coming to life right before our eyes and it was an unforgettable experience. The footing & foundation are very solid, the framing, exterior finishing and the interior finishing were remarkable and used great materials. Overall, his team are highly skilled contractors and I will forever be grateful for their talent and exceptional customer service. His team was extremely professional, respectful, hardworking and reliable individuals. They were always united, always on time and always available to answer our questions. It was such a beautiful, pleasant experience that I will always speak very highly of SOD builders and I will never trust anyone else other than this team to do work in my house or any other project I may face in the near future."
5,"We had a great experience with Oren from SOD builders. Oren was able to do a good job at our house remodeling the master bathroom and bedroom of our kids with his bathroom too.
The bathroom in our kid’s room is jack and Jill that has a shower/tub with large vanity. The decision to work with Oren and his workers was taken after several meetings with him and his designer Michelle. Michelle was very creative with her ideas about what to do and Oren explained to us each step and stage of the remodeling. The materials were selected by Oren and he gave us several options after he learned what we would like to do and what type of styles we love. The work in the bathroom included the removal all the old tiles, bath tub and shower and install new ones with the design that we selected. The work came out very good and it brought a new life to the bathroom including the new shower handles, Paint, vanity with sink and faucet.
The master bedroom required more work due to the age of it. We wanted to have marble floor, and special tiles all over the walls, paint and some extra storage cabinets that will allow us to have extra space. Oren worked with his workers on this project on a daily basis and the remodeling came out very good. Oren was able to assign 2 teams of workers to our house and to make sure that the work will end according to schedule."
5,"Oren, from SOD builders, is great general contractor I have ever hired. A close friend recommended him and I couldn't be happier. Oren first did some smaller jobs, like replacing all our toilets with water-saving models. He also fixed a serious leakage problem that we didn't know about because it was caused by the flooring people not putting in the correct toilet seal. The musty smell that we couldn't find is now gone. He finished a bathroom remodel, tearing out the vinyl shower/tub and replacing it with a Jacuzzi whirlpool tub. The bathroom was quite large and now looks even larger, not to mention beautiful. He and his workers on the tub and tile installation that was complex and time-consuming. I was especially happy that he was able to adjust what I wanted to do to keep me within my budget by suggesting different tiling pattern choices. We went with his suggestions and it is so much better than what we were going to do. We would highly recommend Oren for repair work and remodels, though we hope he doesn't get too busy. We have started a new to-do list for him."
5,"This company (SOD Builders) proved to me how great they are! It’s hard to remodel a house especially when you don t know where to start from or what to begin with. I found SOD Builders on several places including a magazine and I called to their office and spoke to Sofia. Sofia scheduled an appointment with Oren and she also called me an hour before to confirm the appointment. Oren came over and after a 2 hours meeting, he was able to give me an estimate for the kitchen. He was so good of explaining the all the building and safety codes so I was pretty amazed with his knowledge .He didn't push me to sign anything like other companies did and he wanted to have another meeting with me in order to show me a design of the new kitchen. I liked that so, after the second appointment and looking at his new design of the kitchen, I decided to hire him. His team of demolition people, carpenters, framers etc... Was so knowledgeable and clean .This guys do know how to take care of customers and how to work clean and good. Oren was coming almost every day to check the work and go over the details with me again in order to make sure we don’t miss anything and that I’m happy with the current progress. The job turn out great .Oren made sure that I will not have to pay any other fee more over the contract. I would recommend him to all my friend. I am very HAPPY"
5,"Oren with SOD builders was the Manager that managed our remodeling project and his end results work and schedule was just perfect.  I know when usually you start a remodeling project of any kind, you figure the schedule to be very flexible and the remodeling project to always take weeks or months to finish beyond what the contractor says, but in my review here I would like to tell you that Oren and his crew of people finished on time.  All the workers worked every day and did not miss one day or late, and the work was without any doubt top notch.  I had, really, nothing to complain about.  Therefore Oren and SOD builders deserve this positive.  What I liked most in this remodeling was that Oren made sure that the workers will know exactly what do each day and that all the materials will be at the house waiting for them and not the other way around."
5,"I had two bathrooms completely remodeled with SOD builders (Oren). Oren did a great & quality work and delivered 100% on budget. I was concerned about any hidden problems or charges at first, since I had some concern there were few leaking pipes behind the wall that might have caused an issue. Oren and his guys did a thorough probe testing before starting and making their estimates. Everything ended up very well and I got two beautiful new bathrooms, even though it was one week behind schedule but completely on budget which was great thing after all! Our experiences with Oren (The supervisor) and the Designer on top of the tradesmen were 100% positive. They took our need to leave in the house a fully functioning bathroom at all time and made it happen (I must mentioned that several other companies told us clearly that it will be 'impossible' to have it when I got an estimate from them - that was also more reasons to what SOD builders gave us and lived up to). I am very pleased with our choice and the results."
5,"I have no complains about this company and the people that worked at my house. At my house, Oren sent 4 workers that came over and did all the paint work. They covered everything and made sure to move all the bulky items so they won’t get damaged. After they finished the work, they returned and arranged the items and then moved to the next area. Oren assigned to my house his supervisor Charlie and he visited the house several times during the work time and made sure that we are happy and that there are no problems. Most of the paint work was a sponge paint with 2 colors but the common areas were with a special paint which took longer to do. I'm very happy with this company and I highly recommend them for any paint work."
5,"SOD builders just finished a full remodeling of our house. It all started with our meeting with Oren and Michele by measuring and understanding what we want to do. Michele came over several times and presented to us her designs and Oren was the person that tried each time to improve the space and to maximize the quality of the materials. The remodeling started with the Kitchen and bathroom at the same stage of work, while the work in the kitchen in process, Oren and his workers started to work on the dining room & laundry room. The plumbing and main rain replacement repairs work was done by several of his people and they did a great job in that part too. The kitchen that we remodeled was with oak wood and included an island, counter tops, new outlets and appliances.
The hallways contained several closets and storage spaces that were designed and installed by Oren and his people. All exterior windows and texture coated the exterior of our house. We had never before taken on anything like this and Oren walked us through every step of the way from permitting to code to design explaining what needed to be done in realistic steps. The crew of workers showed up to the house on time every day and did a very professional job in all respects. Any difficulties were taken care of immediately by either Oren or Avi. Many great ideas came from these 2 and also from Michel. The proof that SOD builders are great company is at the end results, as now we have a beautiful home with all the modern touches and for much less than other bids that had much less work involved. Everything that Oren said he would do, he did. I would recommend SOD builders for any size job you have in mind, they stand by their word."
5,"SOD builders provided us with an amazing customer service throughout the process of the remodeling from start to end. Their prices were very competitive. It doesn't get much better than this. We were having foundation work done on my elderly mother's home in LA. We arranged this remotely via a friend that recommended us to Avi and Oren. Avi took time, care, and patience to make sure that the remodeling will be comfortable with the process and to answer each and every one of our questions. This alone makes us recommend them as highly as possible. Customer service of this level is very very rare today. The work that they did was managed by Oren. Oren brought his 3 men team and made sure they will do an amazing work and as fast as they could.  I would use this company again without any hesitation. I'd give 6 stars if I could."
5,"we LOVE LOVE LOVE SOD builders. this is the THIRD time we are using them over the last ten years, each for progressively bigger and bigger jobs. they are so kind and on top of stuff and just get it done. they have a manager assigned to the task so you have someone you can always call and they have someone for everything. just whatever you need. and they do it right. 
whether it was little finishing touches or knowing just how to redo our old hardwood floors, what sink to put in, how to fix our cabinets, fixing the deck outside, making our outdoor area a beautiful patio space we now love, making beautiful built ins for us, interior and exterior painting, fencing, electrical, refreshing our kitchen so that now it is just gorgeous, all of it, just done perfectly. 
literally, i cannot say enough good things. i would never ever use another contractor. working with SOD feel like you have an uncle in the business that you can just call when you need help. and you know will be taken care of like family. 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
5,"Great company and people to deal and work with! The main thing that I liked in this remodeling was the communication and the care that Oren showed me. He gave me the feeling that his is remodeling his own bathroom and he cared for every detail in the remodeling. The bathroom remodeling that I did, started with the selection of all the materials, color combinations and all the hardware that Oren will install in the bathroom. Oren planned everything pretty good and he made sure not to have any extra materials so the total amount will remain the same. At the end of the remodeling, the total price was the same as the original estimate and this meant a lot to me because I heard so many stories where the final price become higher due to extra items that the contractor add during the remodeling."
5,"We had the need to enlarge the bathroom and to add a bath tub. We spoke to several contractors and companies about this project and we met with few of them. When we spoke to SOD builders. The person that we spoke with was very nice and polite. She scheduled a meeting with Adam. Adam came over at the time frame that was scheduled ahead by the office and he was the person that was able to give us a good quote for that and we were able to speak to some of his past. After we approved the quote and gave our OK to start, Adam sent his workers to start work. The work started with the demolition of the existing bathroom and adding the new frames. Then, all the plumbing and drainage was completed with the lighting. When all of that was completed, they did all the drywall and paint including all the electricity. The floor was one of the last items that they did and it came out great. I want to mention that we enjoyed working with Adam and his team of workers. They are nice and professional people."
5,"We recently had a master bath and a guest bath remodel with SOD BUILDERS.
Their project manager Lance was very helpful in choosing the right materials and answered all our questions in every step!
The team was very friendly, respectful and cleaned every day the work was done...
Although some issues/extra fixes came up, they could finish project on time.
Best customer service from the office too.
Love our new baths!"
5,"This was my first remodel, and it was a large project for a small space. SOD was very professional from the beginning. I never felt nickel and dimed which is typical for construction companies in this market. The workers, project managers and management were very responsive and focused on making sure I was happy with the work. The quality of the remodel was excellent. I've gotten so many compliments from guests who have seen my gorgeous, new bathrooms."
5,"Look no further! The construction team from ""SOD Builders"" saved my life after a stupid contractor disappeared leaving my house roof bathroom and kitchen un-finished ,he left trash all over and my roof was open,uncovered and literally exposed to the rain,wind and weather...
I found SOD Builders on HOUZZ and made a decision to hire them after interviewing Oren and Michelle ,
They were able to address the issues we had and found ways to help us to complete the work in minimum time and cost (!!!).
Me and my wife can't explain how we thank this company since they are our new angels!!!
Thank you ! thank you ! Thank you!
We are going to recommend SOD to anyone who need construction and home improvement work!"
5,"We've remodeled several homes, and SOD Builders was by far the best experience we've ever had working with contractors. 
We remodeled our entire home and added 800SF to the back of the house.
The build pool house (we can't wait to use it this coming summer). Either Oren or Adam was on the Job Site almost every day, the workman were courteous and cleaned up after themselves, and the job was finished ahead of scheduled and turned out beautiful. We could not give a higher recommendation. Excellent company to work with."
2,"I've been waiting for awhile to write this review. I was genuinely hoping things would have worked out between us and SOD but that was not the case. To be completely upfront we never got to the actual building/construction part of our relationship with SOD. We worked with them for over a year and ultimately left with a sour taste in our mouth over the whole experience. I'm giving two stars because even though we didn't end up working with them their designer (Michele (sp?)) and some of their staff were great to work with. 

We wanted to do the following to our home:
Remodel master bathroom
Master bedroom - Install new flooring, paint, and sliding glass door/one window replaced (They quoted $10,000 for *just* this - FYI)
Stairs - refinished
Living - build a custom bar, resurface fireplace

We reached out to SOD through Houzz and they were prompt to reply. They sent someone out to give us a quote. Everything went fine, and we called a few times after that but never received the quote. After a few months (we were slow to follow-up too) they sent someone else out to give us another quote as it had been awhile since the first guy had come out to our house. That's when we started working with Michael and things went terribly from that point on. I mean very very terribly. 

Michael came out and did a walk through of the house with us. He was having a hard time grasping what we wanted and wasn't understanding our vision. On top of that we were having a hard time understanding him and what was included in their services. At this point we were becoming frustrated but Michael assured us everything would be fine. After a month we received the quote from him. It was extremely poorly written and we couldn't tell what was included and what wasn't. We had three separate phone calls with Michael and still couldn't tell what we were getting. We said we wanted to think it over for a few weeks. After a month we again contacted Michael and asked about the price difference between adding a bathtub to the master or not. He then told us we would need to pay him $5,000 for an architectural designer before he would do anymore with us. This set off major red flags for us. We were told before that design was included with SOD. Michael then said he was going to be out of town but he wanted to send his colleague, Ram, to our home to see it and take some measurements that he missed. We thought that was weird but agreed to call and set-up a time with Ram. After speaking with Ram it became VERY clear to Ram and to us that Michael hadn't work for SOD in over a month and Ram was very panicky because he thought Michael had told us when he clearly hadn't. The most alarming part was NO ONE FROM SOD EVER CALLED US TO TELL US. So, we almost signed a contract with some other company and didn't even know it....

At that point we called SOD and I feel like we were super reasonable since they never bothered to tell Michael's clients he had left the company. We just asked to meet with someone else. They sent their designer out to our home. She was great and really restored our faith in SOD. When the owner returned he came out and sent us a new quote. We were discouraged to see the same quote style from Michael and ended up having to have ANOTHER call with the owner to figure out what was included and what wasn't. We solved it by making a spreadsheet since about 10 items we asked for didn't show up in the quote AT ALL. After that we took their final numbers and compared them to what Michael provided us in his first quote when he actually worked for SOD and they were much higher. We approached the owned about the difference and he said - doesn't matter. I won't go down to that price. So, he wouldn't honor a price his former employee made and we spoke to SOD again. 

They never called us after that. They never made any attempt to do right by us even though they basically set us up with someone who tried to defraud us. I am honestly just 100% disappointed in the whole experience. 

I think they do great remodel/construction work if you can get past the poorly explained process, bad company organization, and lack of customer service. We didn't and we lost a year of our lives to it. I would not recommend SOD to anyone, and I don't think they care about what they did to us or how our project was handled."
5,"I met with Eran from SOD last Spring and he had a lot of great ideas for my kitchen and bath remodel. Their bid was very competitive and I selected SOD to do the project. One of the key differentiation was that Eran did 3D renderings of the space and we went through several rounds before finalizing the scope of work. This was a great way to finalize all of the details in a visual way, which saved me on hiring a designer and undoubtedly saved a lot of rounds of changes once construction began. Throughout the project, everyone from SOD was incredibly responsive and Eran was my point of contact throughout the entire project. He's easy to work with, highly service-oriented, and always available by phone/text or email.

SOD has a large team with plumbers, electricians and provides full services - from counters to flooring and shower doors. The quality of the work was very high and they were also receptive to getting the smallest details just right. I was most impressed after the job finished when Eran and team went above and beyond to make sure that every last detail was taken care of.

SOD is an entrepreneurial, modern construction company and I would use them again."
5,"I would definitely use SOD again for any future remodeling projects. During the initial process of getting bids from various vendors, they were not the cheapest or the most expensive, but they had the best customer service and that is what won me over. This being the first time I've ever done a remodel, I went over every detail of the bid and checked their referrals, licenses, insurance coverage, etc. Even before I committed, Daniel was super great at responding and answering all of my questions and putting me at ease. The process was painless and ""pressure free"" and I very much appreciate their approach.

Daniel was an absolute pleasure to work with and his team did a wonderful job. They were polite, courteous, considerate (they made sure to cover areas that they would be walking through, cleaned up the area daily, etc), and very accommodating during the entire process, especially with changes along the way. They remodeled both bathrooms at the same time from demolition to finish. It was hard living with both bathrooms being done simultaneously and seeing as how these were my only bathrooms in my home, my ""must-have"" was to have a working toilet during the remodel (showering could be done elsewhere, but a working toilet was deal breaker for me!). They not only finished ahead of schedule (total time: about 5 weeks), but they also did a few extra's for me i.e. installing a ceiling fan, replacing hallway ceiling lights. The results were remarkable and I couldn't be more pleased with the results. I've received many compliments on the work and have referred them to several friends and co-workers and will continue to do so.

I would not hesitate to use them again. When I remodel my kitchen, I plan on using them again."
5,"I chose SOD for a complete kitchen remodel and plumbing upgrade. Working with the designer Michelle was a pleasure.  She had a clear sense of what we were looking for and knew just when to offer her opinion as we were sorting through the dizzying array of options.  When the building actually began, everyone at SOD was easy to contact, the crew always professional.  There were a few glitches, but they were minor, nothing out of the ordinary for such an extensive job. 

Early in the process, Oren, the owner of the company, told me that he would do whatever it took to make sure I was happy at the end of the job--and he completely delivered.  There was no request that wasn't honored, no small issue that was ever contested. They never made me feel picky, even though there were times I felt that way.  Oren called me a few months after the job was done to make sure I was happy.  When I mentioned a few minor issues that had come up (a cabinet door was sticking and the faucet had worked a little loose) he had someone come out within a day to take care of them. SOD didn't give me the cheapest bid (they weren't the most expensive either, for the record) but it's worth a little extra money to find a builder that does beautiful work and is willing to work with you to make sure you're satisfied."
5,"Oren, the general contractor, gave us a bid that was reasonable and when he came to our house he brought his designer Michelle, who showed us pictures and gave us ideas about what could be done to our house.  Michelle was with us to help pick out tile, granite slabs, paint colors, and cabinet styles.  The job itself had one hic-up but was remidied by Oren.  The foreman/woman that was assigned to our job told us that if we had any questions we could call her day or night and she would be available.  This turned out not to be the case and Oren eventually let her go and we were given a new foreman, Robert, who was available whenever we needed help.
   Overall everything went well.  Oren had workers at our house just about every day and the workers were very professional in doing their jobs.  They even swept up at the end of the day so we wouldn't track dust into the rest of the house.  Our remodel started on January 6th and was completely finished by March 14th.  I have waited until now (6 months after completion) to see if anything went wrong before giving my review and I can honestly say that everything has held up well.  No cracks in the drywall, and no leaks anywhere.  Given all that was accomplished in just over 2 months I would say that Oren and his crew did a wonderful job."
5,"I am extremely pleased with the job that SOD Builders did for me: a full kitchen remodel, including a complete gut and redesign of the room.   The quality of their work was top-notch, the workers were always professional, respectful, and friendly.   In particular, SOD's designer was very helpful in bringing my vision to life.

No project of this magnitude is completely glitch free, but SOD was very responsive to my every request.  This is not a contractor you have to worry about deserting you mid-job.  

The answer to the ultimate question ""Would I hire them again for other work?"" is ""Absolutely"".  Though it took a bit longer than I would have liked to complete the job, in the end I couldn't be happier with the results.  I will enjoy this space for decades to come."
5,"We absolutely love Oren and SOD Builders, Inc.  After meeting with multiple contractors to remodel our entire home and we added 1500SF to it, Oren was a breath of fresh air.  He wasn’t pushy like most other contractors.  Instead, he was polite, knowledgeable, trustworthy and professional.  This project was our first re-model (pretty massive for first remodel) and we didn’t know anything about the process.  Oren guided us through everything from start to finish. He listened carefully to what we wanted, gave us suggestions, and showed us lots of examples on his computer of other homes he had remodeled and build.  Lance and Michelle went with us to stores to help us pick out everything in our home--appliances, tile, and counters. They built us all custom cabinets  He was patient and supportive, always offering his perspective and advice and helping us make color and style decisions.  He, Michelle (our head designer), and the rest of their team were all a pleasure to work with.  They were hardworking, polite, knowledgeable, paid attention to every detail, and showed true pride in their work.  Lesmi checked in with us every day, either by phone call or by email.  The crew cleaned up at the end of each day.  The team was so efficient that, despite us adding a few additional projects along the way, they finished the project ahead of schedule.  And, we are extremely happy with our new home.  It is more beautiful than we could have imagined and we are so thankful to Oren and his team.  We have already recommended SOD Builders to family and friends and are looking forward to having him redo our rental home in the near future."
5,"We called SOD to start a kitchen remodel.  During the time they quoting us on the kitchen our hall bathroom's pipes exploded and we decided this project was more pressing.  We were glad that we got to work with this company on a smaller project before tackling the huge project of our kitchen remodel.  SOD did an awesome job with the bathroom.  We are extremely happy with our new modern bathroom. It is beautiful.  We always felt comfortable with all the specialists that came to work on the house. The work they did was top notch.  Any questions or concerns we had during the project were addressed quickly.  They also helped us to figure out design details, and since this is not my forte we really appreciated the guidance.  

We were so happy with the bathroom remodel that they are working on our kitchen now.  It is coming together beautifully.  I would absolutely recommend them for any project that you have."
5,"We love our kitchen and what's even more amazing, we still love everyone at SOD.  Through every step of the way, we felt like Oren, Michelle and team did everything in their power to give us exactly what we wanted, or, as was often the case, something better than we could have imagined.   We are a bit clueless on the design front.  We knew we wanted a Dwell worthy high end kitchen that had warmth and natural stone elements while still being sleek and modern. We had no idea how to do this.  Michelle helped us design the kitchen, change the layout, reposition things, and redesign the kitchen again.  She helped us select materials, match stain samples, hardware, everything. And this ""call me anytime and I will pick up or call you immediately"" service is just part of the deal. It's how SOD operates. 

If there was ever anything that we were unhappy about, it was addressed immediately. I believe someone came out three times to make sure the wall of cabinetry fit into the soffit line perfectly. We chose an incredibly difficult tile to install for our backsplash. Each tile is individually cut and affixed to paper.  The tiler pulled out individual tiles that we felt were too dark or light or misshapen... dozens of them, until it looked perfect. They were very accommodating when working with the Miele specs for the custom panel refrigerator and even redid a panel when we saw a blemish. The cabinetry makers SOD uses are craftsmen and you can tell when you look at the end result and feel the substantial drawers and cabinets in your hand. The cabinetry and drawer hardware used is on par with what Poggenpohl and Boffi.  After months and months of hard use, I still get a little thrill every time the drawers soft close smoothly. 

When we were conducting our search we were looking for quality, excellent customer service and affordability. SOD provides all of these. NOT ONCE did we feel taken advantage of or overcharged in any way. Our quote did not change.  There weren't any hidden costs or fees.  In fact, we found that we were so on budget that we were able to splurge on our cabinet hardware and backsplash.

It has been nine months and we have not had a single issue with anything in our kitchen.  It is still beautiful, it still looks new and it is very, very user friendly.  This is a kitchen used and abused by children but appreciated by adults. 

We couldn't be happier and will use SOD again in the near future."
5,"Professional, clean, knowledgable and punctual. They finished building our new roof before a week was over and did not leave a mess! 

I'd definitely hire them again."
4,"I sent an urgent request to SOD builder to get a bid for my bathrooms and garage remodeling project due to the water damage at home. SOD customer service was really nice. After I canceled my first appointment, they were able to schedule a project manager to visit my place according to my time. The project Manager was helpful and professional. We got the estimates within 3 days."
5,"I had a guest bathroom remodel job and met with approximately four contractors. SOD Builders came in with a cost that was within our budget. We broke the job up into two stages, the first was a demo of a 3x3 shower and build a walk in tile shower that can accommodate ageing parents with a grab bar, shower bar, soap shelf and seat. New tile was laid and our new shower was a nice combo of large tile, glass tile mosaic and stainless steel appointments and a seat. Oren and his crew took about two weeks for the complete job which also included installing a shower light fan combo, paint and trim. The second portion of the rebuild was the installation of a new vanity and placing tile where the old vanity once stood. This vanity was not made for a corner and SOD builders took the marble splash guard and matched it to another piece to create a corner vanity unit. We are very pleased with the work performed and the crew that worked on this job. We would highly recommend SOD builders for your construction / remodel jobs."
5,"Services provided:
Completely remodeled the kitchen, updated 2 bathrooms, completely remodeled the master bathroom, relocated the laundry room, installed attic insulation, replaced all windows and interior/exterior doors, and installed wood flooring.

Details:
Oren and Michal, his designer, were fantastic to work with.  Oren and Michal both met with us to walk through our home and understand the project we wanted to do.  Oren's bid was competitive, but the biggest reason we decided to hire him is because we could see how passionate he is about his work and we felt that Michal's vision was a perfect match for the look and feel we were going for.

Michal was very helpful in the planning phase and helped design our kitchen layout and cabinets, as well as our master bathroom.  She was also extremely helpful when it came time to start picking finishes.  She totally understood our style and helped us narrow down design options.  In addition, she was not afraid to let us know when she felt that we may be making choices that we could regret.  We greatly valued her opinions and support!

We had bought an older home that needed a lot of updating and improvement, so the job was quite big.  Luckily, we were not living in the home during the remodel.  However, we stopped by to check the progress at least a couple of times per week and were always impressed that the workers cleaned up after themselves each day and stored their tools even though they knew we weren't living there.  Whenever we did see the workers, they were always pleasant and courteous.  

About mid-way through the project, Oren's foreman leading up our project left the company.  This caused some delays, but the new foreman, Hector, was even better than the first and did everything he could to help make up for lost time.  We had told Oren from the beginning that he could take his time because we weren't in any hurry to move in (we were living at my father's house so that I could take care of him until he passed away from cancer).  The project was completed about 2 months behind schedule, but we had added some work to the original scope and wanted Oren to take his time to make sure everything was done exactly how we wanted it.  

We have now lived in our home for about 3 months.  After we moved in we began to notice certain issues and defects and kept a running list of items to be fixed.  Oren sent his crew back out about a month ago and fixed everything on our list with great attention to detail.  We could not be any happier with our ""new"" (old) home!

We have worked with other contractors on smaller projects at our previous homes before and they always quoted us much lower, but the final bill was much higher and the quality of the work was lacking.  We paid Oren exactly what he originally quoted us and are very happy with the results.  We would highly recommend Oren for his professionalism, attention to detail, and passion for his work.  He is an honest person and demands the same level of honesty and quality from his crew."
5,"I was impressed by SOD Builders commitment to satisfaction. We had lots of small details that we wanted to do right and Oren was absolutely willing to get all the little things done properly, and without a charge. The most impressive thing was that we agreed on a price at the start and Oren stuck to it even when it would cost him extra money to get right.

They did also a very good job of keeping my place clean, keeping things running while doing construction, and overall being very responsible and with a great regard to quality!"
5,"SOD Builders is a one-stop shop to my dream house.  With a complete team of project manager, designer, architect, licensed plumber/electrician, tile/floor specialists, painters, carpenters... they can put together pretty much any requests that you may dream up for your projects.  They did a gut renovation for me on an entire floor including demolishing and rebuilding a kitchen and 2 bathrooms, removing popcorn ceiling and smoothing out textured walls, updating all plumbing and electrical and putting in new hardwood floor.  SOD Builders provided high-quality work, expert advice and top-notch customer services.  The one thing the owner, Oren, said to me most often during the project was “whatever makes you happy, we’ll do it!” and they do!  They are very flexible to unexpected changes and always accommodating to the needs of the customers.  I picked out all the floors and tiles I wanted, and the project manager, Adi, helped me looked all over California to find the best prices for the materials.  When a part of the fireplace didn’t turn out looking like the design I had in mind, they immediately sent a team to rebuild the area to change it to look exactly like what I wanted.  For the bathrooms, we decided to put up tiles on all walls, we originally thought since all the walls were also newly built, installing the cement boards under the tiles would be sufficient enough, but Oren insisted on using the floating cement because he believes the method makes the bathrooms much more durable and provides better quality even though it was more costly to him and took longer to build.  There were many examples like these throughout the project.  I would highly recommend SOD Builders to anyone."
5,"Services Provided: 
Combined a kitchen area with a breakfast area, pushed out an exterior wall, enlarged the opening between the kitchen and dinning room, gutted the entire area, redesigned the ceiling in a pyramid fashion to solve the problem that the breakfast area had a vaulted ceiling, installed two new large windows then built an unbelievably beautiful, entirely functional high end kitchen.  We were so pleased with the work we had SOD remodel two bathrooms, a laundry room and install new linen cabinets in a hallway.  They also installed a beautiful large garden window in the dinning room.
Comments: 
If you are looking for an honest contractor who can make your most ambitious dreams come true, look no further than SOD Builders.  I alrey had my own idea (I even had my own drawings) of how my new kitchen should look.  I interviewed several highly rated contractors but I selected SOD for several reasons.  I met with the Project Manager, the Head Carpenter and Oren Dragan, the owner, all of whom seemed completely confident that they could meet my every expectation.  SOD did not give me the lowest bid I received, nor was it the highest but I was impressed by the fact that all of the major trades people were employed directly by Oren.  That meant that they were hand selected by and responsible directly to him.  It also meant that scheduling the various trades would be easier.  It turned out that all of the tradesmen (Carpenters, Plumbers, Electricians, Cabinet Makers, Tile Installers, Painters, etc.) were highly skilled, professional and hard working individuals who worked together like a well-honed team.  While the basic plan was mine, the end result was more than I could have imagined due to the experienced and creative input of Oren's team.  Joe, the Head Carpenter, came up with the idea of the tiered ceiling to beautifully unite the kitchen ceiling with the breakfast area ceiling which was vaulted.  He even took the time to build a model of his idea out of a cardboard box to give us a visual of his concept.  I could not ever improve on Golan's, the Cabinet Maker's designs for the cabinets.  Every drawer and cabinet were perfectly placed and completely functional. All the drawer open to the full extent.  All of the drawers and cabinet door have soft-close hinges.  The corner cabinet has a lazy susan.  There are slide-outs under the sinks and in the pantries.  Best of all, all of the pots and pans fit in drawers.  The large flat screen TV in the kitchen looks like it is part of the cabinetry.  The quality of the wood and the workmanship could not have been better.  The same quality and devotion to perfection was true of carpenters, plumbers, electricians, tile installers, painters and countertop fabricators.  All of the workers arrived on time every day, worked hard all day long (no goofing off) and cleaned up the area every day before they left.  This project passed all inspections with flying colors.  Oren Dragan made sure that every detail was completed to perfection.  I definitely would use SOD Builders again and I will highly recommend the Company to my friends and neighbors.  It was a no-hassle pleasure to work with Oren and his team."
5,"We first heard of SOD through another review company.  They had the highest review rate and highest score.  So, we gave them a call.  

My wife and I had a very good idea of what we wanted and how much we were willing to spend.  I had originally built this bathroom (and addition) so I had a base knowledge in construction.  When SOD arrived they were very professional and respectful and came with a slew of referrals..  They listened to our ideas and then offered modifications to enhance our vision.  We were very happy with all their changes to our initial design and even more delighted in that most of these opinions actually lowered our costs.  Their offer was many thousands below the nearest competitor and their ideas were superior to any views we had previously heard.  Their time frame was 3 weeks from start of demo to final inspection.

It was several weeks before they began but once they started, they moved quickly and efficiently.  They took great care to cover and isolate the house from their work area.  Demo occurred with the workers transiting the house in a plastic ""tunnel"" so as not to scatter dust and debris.  All materials were quickly hauled off site.  Each phase progressed similarly with the workers taking great care of the non-involved portion of the house before they began work on the bathroom.  I must give credit to Hector (the foreman) for providing a seamless transition from one phase to the next and being on site to take care of each question or request we had.  He was very quick to rectify or resolve any ""problem"" we had.  Another lido needs to go to SOD's tile man.  His work is superb.  When my wife was unable to visualize the new ceramic floor, he painstakingly arranged the floor in each of 3 patterns so she could choose which one best fit her initial vision.  Once decided, he applied the tiles (floor, shower walls and shower floors) to perfection.  The SOD plumber did a very good job of removing an existing water heater (left in place during the demo) and installing the new tankless one without leaving us hot waterless for more than an hour.  A very good feat!   SOD would have finished under 3 weeks but we opted to use a granite provider from whom we were able to procure a pice of fusion granite.  That change forced SOD to hold off on 4 days of work but they neither complained or asked for a change order.  

I am able to give SOD Builders the highest rating due to their work ethics, abilities and final product.  I have all ready referred them to 2 of my friends who are having work done to their homes.  You wont go wrong using this company. 

(this review has also been posted on another referral site by me, the homeowner)

5,"It was a pleasure working with SOD Builders from start to finish! Oren and Michelle came to our house and the end result is way beyond our expectations, WE LOVE OUR NEW HOME!
Oren & Michelle, were the third estimate that we received, they were not the lowest bid but they were very competitive they offered a new design and layout that no other company had thought of, I guess that’s a big difference when you have an in house designer (and no it does not effect on pricing, we had other companies that came and gave higher bid with no designer included). The new layout is great they were able to open up the space in our living room to the kitchen, my house looks like a picture in a fancy magazine, and it is very efficient when it comes to the use of the space.
The kitchen is just stunning and I’m so happy I can show off when I have friends over. When we bought the house the space was divided and it had a feeling of old and small and not so friendly.
The working process was very easy, I was always informed; the crew was always friendly and professional. When question and issues arise Oren and Michelle were available through there system very promptly, and I always had the feeling that there will be no compromising on the quality of work nor my satisfaction.
At the end, we are very happy with SOD builders, now I’m trying to convince my husband on remodeling our master bathroom; it has to match my new modern living space J will keep you posted.
SOD Builders it was great, thank you!"
5,"I had a great experience with SOD Builders. They ended up doing several projects for me, remodeling my master bath and my kitchen as well as retiling my front entry way and adding lighting to my living room. They seemed to work efficiently and completed the projects in a timely manner. 
  I am quite happy with the quality of their work as well as they way they seem to stand by it. Working with SOD was a really positive experience for me. And even though my house is almost 40 years old I’ve been told by more then one person the kitchen looks like a model home and the changes I’ve made have let the house come alive again. I would absolutely work with SOD builders again."
5,"SOD Builders has done a great job with our massive construction project.  The built us a new structure (garage/guesthouse) and now we are in the process of renovating our yard.  They have built a fence, laid flagstone, and are currently building a veranda.  They do great work for a fair price!"
5,"We had to replace a a bathroom ceiling light/heat/fan in our condo with no attic and had ""hole"" left in the ceiling after the electrician completed their job.  Had three companies quote on this job to drywall and repaint our entire bathroom a long with repairing the ""peeling"" areas around the tile and re-grouting our entire tub area.
SOD Builders was the highest cost, but carried all the insurance, including workman's comp and was very professional...and  at the end of the day---you get what you pay for!  The work that they did was outstanding - the drywall work that they did on our ceiling is like ""art""...you would never even know that it had been cut open.  They took care of all the details and made sure that we were VERY happy and they did what they said they would do - they got the entire job done within two days where everyone one else was quoting at least five days and with multiple vendor partners...?  Would recommend this company and will use them again!  Thank you SOD Builders for taking on this small project"
5,"SOD Builders painted the outside of our house and replaced damaged  patio deck around our pool. 

We were very pleased with the end results of both jobs and would recommend SOD Builders."
5,"SOD Builders re-did our Master Bathroom recently. They had a window of about 6 weeks to tear out the old bathroom and replace it with everything new, including new plumbing, electrical, carpentry, tiles, shower, basin, granite counter top, toilet, heated floor, etc. We had some idea as to what we wanted for our bathroom, but, didn't really didn't know how to put them all together. SOD Builders accommodated us, on occassion having to redo work because we thought it would look better some other way. Their Foreman Joe's favorite response to all of our requests was, ""not a problem, just let us know what you want"". Oren, the owner, believes that the Customer's satisfaction is so important that he is willing to have his workers do whatever is necessary to satisfy his customers. They did all the work, passed all the inspections, completed the work in 6 weeks, to our satisfaction. One thing, to us, ""after sales service"" is very important. How responsive is SOD Builders to a ""call back"" to refinish grouting because of shifting cracks, etc. Oren told us to not hesitate to call them back. I'm sure this will not be an issue for us."
5,"Love Oren's work. He was very professional throught the entire work. I had a wall removed that divided kitchen from living room. he came rightaway and gave me a quote, he explained the details of the work and possible complications. he also gave me an estimated time to finish, which he kept. Love his work, right away he sent, engineers, got city permits and started demolition. his workers were friendly and were ontime eveday, clean after their work each and everyday, protected my furniture from dust. at the end there was several complication that occur. most of which he had worn me about, and he went ahead and took care of them at no extra charge. will definetelly use their service again. top rated on angies list too."
5,"I hired SOD Builders to remodel our bathroom. The entire crew was extremely courteous, professional and thoughtful. 
Since we had to move out of our house during this time, they accommodated our needs and were flexible and understanding. The workmenship was first class and the service they provided was above and beyond. What I appreciated the most was that I was communicated on a daily basis what was going to happen and where we were with the progress.
I will utiilze them for kitchen project in the future. Thank you SOD team."
5,"We hired SOD to remodel our bathroom.  We interviewed three different contractors, and we went with Oren.   He and his workers did a great job--a very reasonable cost, and they were all very respectful and professional.  More than anything, I found that Oren was a trustworthy person, as he never tried to pull anything or do anything that I had questions about.   The project came off better than I had envisioned, and for the total cost that he had first estimated.  When we are ready to do another remodeling job, we will be sure to use Oren and SOD Builders."
5,"I own a company that deals with real estate investments.
We are using SOD Builders, INC services very often.
In the last 3 years we used them for several construction projects that involve a complete renovation of a house and other maintenance works for our apartment buildings. they are located conveniently in Tarzana.
I must say that they never let me down. Always on time, very professional and courteous, Fast and efficient.
Overall I have to say when I see them work I get to appreciate what they do. It is a hard work.
I will definitely continue using them and also recommend to friends and family."
5,Replaced our roof and completed remodeling projects because of longtime water damage. The projects were completed on time and on budget. The workmanship was excellent. SOD was truly professional and honest regarding all aspects of our projects. I would highly recommend this company.
5,"EXCELLENT.  From start to finish Oren was a pleasure to work with and his crew was always polite and punctual and absolutely 
cleaned up after themselves each and every day.  My neighbors had no idea we were doing such an extensive job in our yard
We would highly recommended SOD Builders if you are looking for any type of job and we are actually in talks right now about moving inside to start the interior.."
5,"I have an AMAZING bathroom thanks to SOD, Oren, the owner is a sweetheart, his guys were great especially Joe and his beautiful blue eyes!   Joe helped put it all together, kept everyone in check.  The Tile guy Jaime is an artist and matched every seam, framed the shower shampoo boxes as if they were a picture.  The Plumber William was excellent.  Oren delivered everything he promised.  

I highly recommend Oren and SOD Builders, I will be using them again when I renovate my other two bathrooms and kitchen which I hope will be soon."
5,"Our old, disgusting kitchen was in desperate need of a remodel.  We wanted everything replaced as well as two of the walls removed so that the kitchen would be more open to the rest of the house.  

Oren and his team were great from the beginning.  He gave us his initial quote and a completion date before he started and he stuck to both the entire time.  Naturally, lots of issues/fixes appeared during the remodel (since we went down to studs and it's an old house), but Oren always took care of everything and never charged us more.  His guys did an incredible job gutting the kitchen, replacing the floor, cabinets, fixtures, appliances, painting, tiling, rewiring, building a new pantry, removing the old walls, installing new support beams, everything.  His crew changed often, but everybody was friendly and cleaned up as best they could at the end of each day.  

There were a few things that needed to be done more than once since Oren was not present every day to supervise  (we had a countertop installed wrong, some crooked outlets, etc.).  That said, Oren ALWAYS immediately fixed the problem at no cost to me as soon as possible (and nothing delayed the completion date we were originally given.)  Speaking of -- Oren was always available through email (he uses Basecamp), phone, texting, etc.  We never waited more than an hour for a response to our question or concern.

In addition, we liked Oren and his team so much we also had them replace our galvanized plumbing under the house and our electrical panel.  Both were his suggestion, but the decision was left to us, and we never felt pressured.

All in all, I think the pictures speak for themselves.  Our kitchen was dated and unappealing and SOD turned it into our dream kitchen at the initial price they promised and by the time they promised it by.  Oren was always easy to work with, his guys were friendly, and we couldn't be happier with the finished result.  We definitely plan to use SOD Builders again."
5,"Oren & Gil from SOD did a complete remodel of our kitchen. We purchased appliances, but they did everything else; gutted the existing kitchen and floor, installed brand new electrical, plumbing, floor, walls and even removed a load-bearing wall to open up the kitchen to the den. They took care of all of the permits, inspections, & fees. Member Comments: We interviewed 7 contractors, four from word of mouth and  three through Angie's list. One by one they came through and spoke with us about cost, design, how they operated and timelines. Each one either had their own idea of how they would do it, or was way to high in price, or just indifferent, but when SOD Builders, Ore & Gil stopped by they made us feel very comfortable, they helped us see our vision. They started right away with demo and worked quickly, they seem to be very well organized and since they have their own electricians, carpenters and plumbers on staff, there was no waiting for the sub-contractor to stop by.
They had a cabinet company and tile folks that we worked with to pick out new cabinets, floor tile and back splash, as well as sink, faucets, even a pasta or pot-filler over the stove. They made it very care-free and they took care of every detail and didn't charge for minor change orders. When we asked about the load bearing wall, they were unsure until their engineer came to visit, so they even gave us an estimate on the cost, in advance, just in case we did need to do the extra work and knowing the price upfront gave us piece of mind. In fact when we did have to do the extra work, they stuck to their quote. 
What I really love about working with SOD Builders was their positive attitude and a willingness to make us happy and to stick with their original quote and NO SURPRISES. 
We really enjoyed working with SOD and we are already getting quotes for a patio renovation."
5,"First and foremost, our kitchen looks amazing!  Every time we now step into it, we’re validated that we made all the right decisions.     

We recently purchased our first home which had an outdated kitchen and a backyard patio in need of improvement so we called S.O.D. for a kitchen remodel and enclosed patio estimate.  Upon first meeting Oren, it’s clear that one word to describe him as is Confident.  Confident in his abilities, confident he would come in on budget, and confident we would be happy with S.O.D. in the end.  And he was right.  They weren’t the cheapest estimate but we can’t imagine the quality we received at any lower price.  Plus, the unexpected perks we received (a new linen closet, extending our wall in our laundry area) more than made up for a slightly higher total price.  Also, they were able to come down in price for the covered patio (which also turned out great!) in order to match a competitor’s price and stay within our budget.  

The whole process took about a month and a half (they were kicked out for a week because we had our floors refinished) which was very close to their original time estimate.  They also kept the arduous city-inspector process as smooth as possible and Oren was always accessible by text, phone or email (even meeting with us on Sundays) and he always gave updates throughout the remodel.  

Overall, it was a positive experience with a great result.  We would definitely recommend to anyone looking to remodel."
5,"I have SOD Builders did a remodel to our two bathrooms at the end of 2010. I had good experience with the team. Compared to other two contractors I hired for other remodeling for my home 3 years ago, SOD Builders were much more responsible. They responded promptly, stick to the budget as well. As a designer myself, I think they are very professional and knew the code very well. And I was satisfied with the work they did. I would be glad to recommend them to others."
5,"I cannot recommend these guys enough. Seriously, my family was in the middle of a mold crisis. Twice in two years. The first time someone recommended that I contact Oren and I did. Boy was I glad I did. He came out RIGHT away, helped me and my young kids, took care of everything, figured out what the real problem was (which honestly no one else had been able to do til that point), and then completely saved us. He totally treated us like we were his own family. Responsive, quick, efficient, kind. Knew what he was doing. Had awesome guys working for him that we totally trusted. When we found ourselves needing more help (for different reasons)  the next year, I knew who to call. and again he swooped in and saved us. SERIOUSLY, CALL HIM. His prices were beyond fair, and I really came to just totally depend on him. I am so glad someone referred him to us, and am happy to forward the favor. He really made us feel safe and important and not gouged and did everything he said he would. and did it well. quickly. what more can you ask for??

btw, let me add that i have referred oren to many many people now and they have all been super happy. seriously, he is a gem. LOOK NO FURTHER."
5,"SOD Builders did a complete home renovation for us (new kitchen, new laundry room, new floors and carpets, interior & exterior paint, electrical re-wire, plumbing, new doors, the works). The end product is beautiful, well-constructed, and they were a pleasure to work with. Very professional, very responsive and trustworthy. We look forward to working with them in the future!"
1,"I hired this company and pd $1500 for design work for my backyard. The returned work was deplorable, and the company even admitted that they were having a hard time keeping designers and they had to push it out to a 3rd party. After numerous calls and emails (which weren’t returned) I decided to write this off to good advertising on a sports radio show."
5,"After reviewing and researching multiple landscape companies, my wife and I reached out to Outdoor Makeovers to do a complete gut of our backyard, and when I say gut, I mean a complete demolition.   Navid came out and reviewed our ideas and the current state of our backyard.  He provided better alternatives in design and flow, which we had not initially considered.   We were very pleased and impressed with his design and knowledge and decided to move forward with the project.   

The scope of our project included complete demolition, two patios (one raised) with a fire pit, new sod, mulch and a build out for a hot tub.  Navid provided video updates throughout the project, which, in total, was completed in less than two weeks.  For the size and scope of our project, we were very impressed and almost in shock of how quickly it all came together.  That just goes to show you the dedication of his team.  We were very pleased with the final design and how it came to life with the complete makeover that his team delivered on.  We initially held off writing this review to give time for things to settle.  That said, COVID set in and it actually allowed us to enjoy our new time in the backyard even more than we initially expected. 

Recently, we reengaged with Navid to address a minor issue with how a section of one of the patio’s pavers had settled.  His team came back out and within the day completely remediated the issue.  This goes to show that Outdoor Makeovers stands behind their craftsmanship and reaffirms the reason why we selected this company for our “little” paradise in our backyard.

1,"After reading reviews, not surprised I saw a couple others where they took consult fees under false pretenses. Saw the same on another site so again how are they getting such great reviews?? Whether $35 or $250, deliberately taking customers consult fee is plain dishonest. I lost my consult fee also, with no services or usable advice given. They appeared to lose interest in giving a good consult when I informed them I was getting other quotes. I am sure consult fees are part of how they make money.The amount of excellent 5 star reviews look very suspicious especially since this was mentioned by the rep several times and the ideas were very standard and similar to other vendors. Not hard to create great fake reviews for your company.

Most importantly, the quote was also so high it was ridiculous! There are much more affordable companies out there who do great work. Shop around."
5,"Navid and his teams were outstanding. From day one Outdoor Makeover & Living Spaces displayed exceptional creativity and project management. We had a few ideas on what we wanted to do with our front and back yards, but Navid and his team took what we wanted to another level. Not only did their final product greatly exceed our expectations, but they also turned it around quicker than first planned. Our yard now has a ""wow"" factor to it - my family and I now love to be in our backyard! Yes, we spent a lot of money - but the quality of work and material used was 100% worth it. Every member of the team worked hard and took great pride in their work - and it showed. Thank you Navid and crews!!"
5,"This is our 2nd project with the outdoor team. Our first project was in October 2019 and we reached out to start our 2nd project in May 2020. Working in phases helped us to stay in budget and was a great decision for us. The Outdoor team had our phase 2 patio and covered pergola done by July 1. (Cost for phase 2 was $39,000) So about 6 weeks to complete our incredible project. My favorite thing about the Outdoor crew is that every one of their workers does high quality work. They truly treat your project as if they were working on their own yard. Although this is an outdoor space it feels like we gained more living square footage on our house. Functional, comfortable, and attractive, it was a great way to enhance our home’s value."
5,"This is the second time we've worked with Navid and Outdoor Makeover, and once again we were thrilled with our choice! This latest project involved two retaining walls, a complete regrading of the backyard and added drainage, new walkways and trees. It was a total transformation that is both functional and beautiful, and we're so grateful to Navid and his team (especially Eddie and Sam) for taking such good care of it. They were responsive, respectful, and incredibly thorough. They also made sure our neighbor was completely happy because the retaining wall replacement involved removing and replacing some of her fence. While the quote might come in a bit higher than some other places, you absolutely get what you pay for in terms of the materials, quality of the work, and customer service. We can't recommend Navid and his team at Outdoor Makeover enough!"
5,"Navid and his crew at Outdoor Makeover just completed our big backyard landscaping project which involved moving a lot of dirt, taking out trees and replanting new ones and building multiple retaining walls. From the onset Navid provided great input on how to design our yard and gave realistic advise on how to save costs. Our yard turned out great and far surpassed our expectations."
5,I just had Outdoor Makeover put in a patio.  These guys are the best.  First they help you to design your space with helpful ideas that help you to end up with a finished project better then you expected.  They show up on time and clean up at the end of each day.  True turnkey job.
5,"My backyard looks amazing the Outdoor Makeover & Living Spaces crew is very dedicated and definitely worked very very hard. It is unbelievable that the work was actually completed in 2 days. The communication between Navid, Brian, his foreman and the crew was excellent. 
A minor issue was quickly corrected to my satisfaction. The price was reasonable (not cheap), but the money is well-worth it. My only criticism would be the time between hiring and beginning of the work. With that stated, we did hire Outdoor Makeover & Living Spaces in the midst of the COVID pandemic, when most people were working on landscaping and property renovation. We would definitely hire the team for future projects"
5,"Navid and team are great to work with! They are professional, thorough, and on-time. We had them redo our front yard and walkway, which turn out beautiful. This is our second project with the team and we would recommend them again and again."
5,"Great experience! We met with Navid for the initial consultation. He was very thorough and gave us ideas for the backyard we never considered. The consultation was well worth the cost, and because he helped in the design process, the finished product was much better than I initially expected. The initial design was a bit more expensive than we were willing to pay so Navid worked with us to get the design within our budget.  We actually settled on a design a bit below our budget, and he advised us to budget an extra X% for unknowns that could happen while under construction. That was really helpful because as the project progressed, there were a few additions and changes that really helped make the finished product better than expected. Once the project began, Navid stayed connected and I saw him regularly. When the crews arrived without Navid, each of the different leads he assigned for demolition (Ivan), construction (Gerardo) , and the landscape (Giovanni), had intimate knowledge of"
5,"After reading several outstanding reviews, we contacted Outdoor Makeover to seek help in transforming our wooded backyard into a landscape that we could use and enjoy.  From the moment we contacted them (initially speaking with Tina), we realized and experienced their wonderful customer service – very friendly and client-centered.  This was perhaps the most important quality we were seeking in working with a landscape company, and Outdoor Makeover excelled in this area from beginning to end.  We experienced the professionalism and workmanship of Outdoor Makeover as second to none.  We recommend Outdoor Makeover without reservation (and would gladly give them more than 5 stars!), and are grateful to have worked with the Outdoor Makeover team and experience their fantastic customer service and work."
5,"We had a wonderful experience with KraftMaster Renovations!  The entire team were fantastic to work with.  We enjoyed having 24/7 access to the team and all job information via their platform.  Everyone on the team was attentive, friendly, professional and talented at their job.  Having our kitchen renovated, Carly designed a great plan and Chris the project manager was there with us every step of the way and always popped by if we needed him.  We work mostly from home and found it to be a smooth process for the job to take place during our work hours.  We never felt out of the loop, or waiting for answers.  If there were even the smallest touch ups or changes, they would return asap and handle.  Shout out to Steve, Nick & Robbie - great job guys.  Plus Chris and the electrician team!  Highly recommended."
5,"It is without hesitation that I provide a recommendation for KraftMaster Renovations (KraftMaster) and their team.  KraftMaster exceeded our expectation at every stage, and delivered on-time.  Over the entire length of the project, KraftMaster met each weekly deliverable, and it was clear what the next steps were.  KraftMaster’s lead designer, Maureen, was incredible to work with.  She is a great listener and picked up exactly what we were looking for – an open space with the ability to close off certain areas for privacy.  The transformation of the space is beyond words.   I remember at our initial meeting, Maureen commented that we had plenty of room to meet our needs, I was skeptical, but she definitely proved me wrong.  
Alexandra was simply amazing at sourcing things and being very practical.  We were looking for a set of custom glass sliders which were well beyond what we budgeted for, however, she was able to find a much more reasonable set of glass sliders which gave the aesthetic of exactly what we were looking for.   We loved all the trades that were involved in our project.  Each one of them were very professional and it was evident that they each took a lot of pride in doing the work carefully and going above and beyond to deliver.  At the project outset, Bob had a team meeting with all the trades to go through the project, open up a few walls to determine if there were any issues at the beginning.  At this point, we were introduced to our project manager, Chris.  Chris was always reachable and very responsive.  He was great at problem solving, and made a great suggestion about tile we had chosen to go around the fireplace.   The job site was cleaned up every day, and all trades were great at answering all my questions.  Our carpenter team consistently mostly of Peter and Walter.  Not only are they both incredible at their work, both of them were so pleasant to be around.  I enjoyed my daily chats with both of them.   I was very impressed with how they hung our fireplace mantle, which consisted of a reclaimed solid piece of barnwood which probably weighed close to 600 lbs.  The plumbers were great.  Moon, Danny & Mike are very good at what they do.  They even diagnosed that our plumbing lines in our laundry room were crossed for the washing machine so when we thought we were using cold water, we were in fact using hot water.  I was impressed with their work ethic that if they found something that wasn’t right, they were going to address it.  The electricians also went above and beyond.  The team consisted of Chris, Nick and Renan.  Their work was incredibly neat, it was evident that they took no short cuts in running lines back to the main junction box.  The tiling expert, Bogden, is a true artisan.  He would spend hours laying out the tiles first before he cut anything to ensure everything lined up perfectly.  

KraftMaster transformed our space to our needs, and we thoroughly enjoy it every day."
5,"Kraftmaster crated a beautiful bathroom for us from a connected room to our master bedroom. The room and the side of the house it was on had no plumbing but the Moon, Danny, and Mike did a great job analyzing how to best get pipes to the room. Krftmaster provides a full service construction service and it starts with interviews and then design. Carly listed to what we wanted out of the renovation and then provided us with 3 different designs with different budgets to choose from. We then went shopping together to work together to pick out the tiles, counter materials, sinks, toilets, fixtures, etc. They have lots of knowledge around these things and can answer any question.

As the project commenced it was great to see a project plan we had access to and could communicate with the team. Chris was our project manager and Steve was our go-to for whatever it was that was needed at a moments notice. The project started on-time and during a difficult time of year when we had multiple snowstorms that made roads underivable and many areas with power outages. This affected the schedule a bit but delays were communicated and justified and they weren't that long.

The carpenters and electricians did great work (Chris, Nick, and Renan are precise electricians - every screw on the switch plates is aligned up-and-down which just shows you their attention to detail) and the tile work was amazing. Bogdan is an incredibly skilled and throughout tile-person and spent considerable time on the mud job and tile work. Super precise.

What was great was that near the end of the job we weren't 100% happy with the alignment of a towl-rack (we made some changes to plans during construction and the carpenter who installed it didn't see the update, it happens) and I pointed it out to Chris who agreed it should be fixed. It wasn't an easy fix as the tiles had to be broken off and replaced the the bar realigned, but they did it and it promptly. 

The end result is a perfect bathroom that suits the home.

I'm already planning a second project with Kraftmaster."
5,"Where can I begin!  This whole process has been organized, trustworthy, smooth and remarkable! Using KraftMaster for our recent master bathroom renovation was the best decision we've made and we know exactly who to call for the next project!  We are now enjoying the bathroom we have always wanted!!!

We have a 1928 Tudor-style house, so it was important to make updates that reflect the style of this house.  Carly and Bob took their time with us at the beginning as we carefully figured out how to achieve a spacious master bathroom with a tub, shower, double sink vanity, and walk-in closet.  This was a HUGE project as we went into a spare room to create a master walk-in closet. They were very creative and mindful of our budget and allowed us to make decisions that we were comfortable with. Carly held my hand with the designs from start to finish in a way that was fun and supportive- she's amazing.  Nick, Robbie, and Carlos made the project come to life and I am so grateful for them! When the job was finished I missed seeing them. The plumbing crew- Moon, Danny, and Mike do such great work we have called them back to help us out with other issues that have come up. Steve, Chris, and Alexandra round out this awesome team with friendly service and work ethic that is hard to come by these days.

I am so grateful that Bob and his team took on this HUGE project and gave us the bathroom of our dreams!  It truly is a showstopper!  Thanks, KraftMaster! You will be hearing from us sooner than you think :)"
5,"We contracted with KraftMaster Renovations in 2020 to renovate our 1960's kitchen.  We couldn't have made a better choice.  The entire process was almost flawless.  Carly, our designer, immediately understood our style and goals, guiding us through the selection of materials.  Chris, our project manager, and Alexandra, our project coordinator, kept the schedule running perfectly with minimal delays, in spite of Covid.
Carpenters, Peter and Walter, plumbers, Danny, Moon and Mike, electricians, Chris, Ryan and Renan, all did an excellent job bringing the design to life.
We will certainly call Bob Gockeler and Kraftmaster for our next project."
5,"We were very pleased with the work of KraftMaster Renovations. We hired them for a second floor reconfiguration, redoing nearly 90 year old bathrooms and in turn slightly reconfiguring two bedrooms. They also helped us with installing HVAC in our home. From the day Bob and Julie walked into our home for a consultation, to the celebratory day they picked up the floor protection, their team treated our house and our family with great respect. They supported our desire to stay in keeping with the house, and as they noticed certain design features of our home, suggested we incorporate them into our renovations. For example, we have a lot of crown molding in our home and instead of ripping it off and throwing it away, they suggested they put it back after door frames were put back on. That is one example of their thoughtfulness and consideration during our renovations. 
Maureen helped us design beautiful space. Nick and his team, Moon and his team, and Chris and his team were kind and respectful, guided us well, clearly communicated what they were doing, and when it came up, what surprises we were faced with (only one major one!). Their work is impeccable, and we continually enjoy our home and new spaces. We highly recommend their work and do plan to use them for future projects."
5,"I have had the pleasure of working with Bob and Julie on two major projects.  One, a kitchen renovation and more recently, a whole house overhaul which included  gutting and updating a kitchen, three bathrooms, and redesigning some of the floor plan so it would work better for our family. 

 Kudos to Maureen who helped me achieve the modern farmhouse feel that we were hoping for.  She and her assistant Alexandra were  a pleasure to work with, patiently walking us through every decision we had to make and there were plenty!  

The construction crews starting with the demolition right on through to finish carpentry are a talented bunch, always friendly, respectful and doing their best to bring the project to life.  

I highly recommend Bob, Julie and their team for any renovation project you might have in mind!"
5,"From the moment we met with Bob, Julie, and Maureen through to completion they made us feel at ease. We had an idea of how we wanted our kitchen to look, but by partnering with Kraftmasters they were able to keep us focused on what was important while building the kitchen we've always wanted all on schedule. My wife and I constantly look back at our inspiration picture and are amazed by how similar it looks. 

A few reasons why Kraftmasters stands out from other home renovation companies:
- They do what they say
- They're transparent
- They care about their customers happiness

I would strongly recommend Kraftmasters to anyone tackling a home renovation project."
5,"KraftMaster was a wonderful design-build team to work with.  They handled the pandemic by always keeping us informed and working safely in our home.  They are hands down the cleanest contractors we have ever worked with, and they honestly treated our home as if it was their own.  We'd especially like to thank Carly, Chris, and Matt for helping us through every stage of the project and for being so accommodating and professional!  Our new bathroom is perfect and we couldn't imagine a better end result!"
5,"The bestest of all. Highly recommend this company. Very professional. Top class this Team has very experienced people when it comes to designing, estimating cost and building"
5,"TO BEGIN: Our Kitchen Remodel Is OUTSTANDING & VERY BEAUTIFUL! 

We have a 250 year old house & are very protective of her good & historically appropriate care. Our OLDE small kitchen needed careful modernizing & my husband & I were stumped as to what to do within our small space. 

I began visiting kitchen redesign/ house remodeling businesses to see who I might find. One fall day I stopped into KraftMaster Renovations store front & was met by 3 generations of the Gockeler family. I had no appointment, but they gave me time. They listened & gave me a rare sense of being in good hands & I'd only just met them. I went home & told my husband, “I think I've found the right people for our historic kitchen remodel.” Following our 1st meeting, my husband was fully on board. So we began. 

Design meetings with Bob Gockeler & Maureen Madigan began in our small kitchen. During that first meeting Bob & Maureen moved us to solutions we'd never considered & we were excited. As we worked the design they both took us into & through great buying choices, & great solutions due to good & creative problem solving -- we were a team. 

Demolition began late summer & we were essentially done in December. Every member of their team was TIP TOP & I ALWAYS felt comfortable when they were in our home. I experienced a rarely-felt-in-NJ courtesy from every member of their team & they always left the premises (inside & out) tidy & clean & everyone was a hard worker.

SPECIFICALLY: 
-I met Robbie Geckeler & Matt Carlson with their deliveries & on site work. They were, as I experienced with the entire team, so courteous, friendly & hard working. 
-The carpentry on our project was I believe uniquely challenging and their team was superb. Their Master Carpenter, Chris Stevens was superlative in his care, talent & skill as was his team: Lead Carpenter, Tyler Cornelissen & Apprentice, Cam Kennedy. 
-It was a pleasure to meet & work with Julie Geckeler who managed communications & scheduling. I really liked the online project management tool (CoConstruct). Meetings in their new office & showroom assisted our decisions. I shifted my countertop choice at one such visit, while perusing one of their lovely displays. 
-At the end of our project I met Alexandra Grosser & Bob’s daughter for the photo shoot, true professionals – ALL.  
-I want to cycle back to Bob Geckeler & Maureen Madigan to say Thank You! We couldn’t have done this without you! Your creativity, professionalism, kindness, & hard work were always present. And I must add FUN - This was a FUN PROJECT.

We thank your entire team & your entire family! Everyone who walks into our new kitchen for the first time gasps (literally) & says it’s SO Beautiful - Because it is. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!"
5,"A First Class Company that Exceeded Expectations!

Our family is thrilled with our recent kitchen remodel from KraftMaster Renovations.  Bob and his team transformed our kitchen from closed-off and dated, to the open, modern center of our home.  It has transformed the feel of the entire house.  It is something our family will enjoy and can be very proud of. 

Simply put, the team is world class – knowledgeable, relentlessly hardworking, talented, friendly, respectful, and clean. Kim’s design turned out to be a perfect combination of form and function with small, thoughtful details that add wonderful unique touches.  Her design was brought to life by Peter and Walter whose expert carpentry work served well to highlight the quality of the material, and Bobby whose meticulous and beautiful tilework has thus far received ""Wow"" comments from all that visit.  There were many others that we grew to know over the course of the project – from Robbie and Matt who were key to executing the logistics of the project, to Moon (plumbing) who on multiple occasions, made sure to work around our toddler who was at home on certain days.  

We’d be remiss not to mention Julie – who made certain that we were updated each step of the way.  She communicated nearly each day which kept us informed and comforted that the project was progressing towards a timely completion.   

We are fully satisfied and plan to be repeat customers.  They made certain that the remodel was exactly what we wanted – no detail was too small.  You won’t regret hiring Kraftmaster for your project."
5,"Bob and Team are great!!  I used KraftMaster for my large kitchen remodel project in Summer 2018.  The project took ~2.5 months.  While this company is not the cheapest quote they really do keep to their timeline and professionalism.  Many times contractors will lose interest or start another job and never finish.  Not KraftMaster and even towards the end of the project i never felt like i was a secondary thought to them.  They remained on schedule and finished on time!  They maintained good contact and updates throughout the project.  The main project managers, Peter and Walter, were so courteous and professional.  Would definitely recommend this firm to anyone in the area looking to do a large or small remodel."
5,"The 2 things that come to mind working with Kraftmaster are craftsmanship and professionalism. In the past I’ve worked with contractors that were really good in one of those areas but lacked in the other. 

The team was excellent to work with. Maureen is a true design talent. She took the time to get to know my wife and I to get a better understanding of the aesthetic we were looking for. She guided us through the big picture design comp process, down to the little fixture details. There were a couple of instances where it took some extra prodding on her part to get us to purchase detail that was out of our original scope and budget, but she has a way of explaining how the extra investment would enhance the overall look. Glad we took her advice.

Our lead contractor Chris was a true professional. He was pleasant to work with and highly skilled at the work. He came up with some creative solutions on a couple of items which were initially a concern for us. He made sure to address some of the call outs that I had throughout the build process. The final implementation was excellent.

Julie was very helpful answering questions and making sure information was relayed back to the team. 

Chris and the electrical team were great. Very responsive to some adjustments that needed to be made along the process. 

As the company owner I was pleasantly surprised how involved Bob was throughout. He didn’t sell the project and then disappear. He was communicative during the entire process. When we hit a roadblock on the project, Bob worked with me to find a solution. 

Overall a great time. I recommended them to some good friends who have also started a major remodel project with Kraftmaster."
5,"Bob and team were excellent from Day 1.  We decided to go with Bob's team because of his patience and his one stop shop team.  A large reno like ours can be very intimidating.  We also live in an HOA community, so there are additional rules and guidelines that Bob and team had to become familiar with.  The team had all sorts of excellent design ideas and helped us narrow things down when we got overwhelmed with choices.  The designer,  construction crew, electrician, and everyone else involved were personable, professional and trustworthy.  We love our new kitchen!"
5,"Bob and the KraftMaster team turned our house, built in 1903, into the home we always knew it could be.  The team really helps you through the project from beginning to end.  The design process went smoothly and logistical coordination was quite impressive.  Everything was always there on time and highly organized.  For our primary points of contact I'd like to specifically say a few words about:

Kim was a huge help as the designer for our project.  She took the rough ideas for our layout and flushed them out with better ideas and a smarter use of space.  Especially for our master bath and walk-in closet, which had an odd shaped room due to the dormer.  It was definitely the smartest way to layout the bathroom and optimized my wife's walk in closet.  

When it came to picking out countertops, tile, and fixtures... thank God we had Kim.  It would have taken us a dozen trips and several fights to get to the decisions we made in two.  Kim had great ideas, but also gave us the space we needed to make our own decisions.  It was a good balance.  

Kim was also very responsive to our daily communications and what seemed like a thousand Change Orders.  She was great at answering questions and allaying any concerns that we had.  Overall, Kim was a huge reason our project turned out so great.  

Nick is an amazing craftsman.  He is super knowledgeable with incredible attention to detail.  I really appreciated this.  Our house was built in 1903 and we wanted to match the detailed molding throughout the rest of the house.  I can only image the pain that was.  He was also great at dealing with and suggesting solutions to the ""charm"", aka problems, that these old houses present.  I really couldn't imagine the house turning out better.  It is a work of art.  

Did we hit small bumps in the road?  Sure, but every project does, and those bumps were taken care of quickly.  We are very happy with the project and look forward to spending many years in our home with our family creating memories."
5,"When we purchased our home, we knew that we wanted to renovate the kitchen and family room space to open it up and give it a better flow. We researched several local companies and settled on KraftMaster Renovations. We had an idea of what we were looking to do, but with the help of Bob, Kim, and their team, we were able to realize the dream of our perfect kitchen space. From start to finish, we were kept in the loop about timeline changes, new ideas, and everyone was responsive to our questions and changes. We are so happy with our new kitchen and highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations to anyone we know looking to renovate."
5,"We have worked with Bob and his team on multiple projects.  The first project was a transformative kitchen remodel where not only did the team reimagine the space in ways we would never have thought possible, the ideas they had for finishes and the final design exceeded all of our expectations.  Our latest project was a technical siding replacement of tongue and groove cedar in a 1978 architect designed home and the results again exceeded our expectations.  Bob's onsite crews are skilled and always professional.  Bob himself is incredibly experienced, very open to new ideas with amazing contacts and resources for the most unusual materials. Case in point, the glass backsplash behind the stove.  An original photo taken by my husband, transformed.   If you can imagine it, he can bring it to life!  He also has great rapport with local inspectors and townships which enables the smooth execution of  projects."
5,"When my wife and I decided to renovate our kitchen, bathroom and other parts of our house, we set out to find someone who could capture our style (which is a bit unorthodox), provide high quality craftsmanship and do so within our budget expectations.   KraftMaster Renovations absolutely delivered.  

As my wife and I started the process, we were fortunate that we share a common design aesthetic—sort of a fusion of Mid-Century Modern and European Modern.  We, however, were also aware that this style is not that common in Northern New Jersey.  As we met with other design and build companies, many struggled to grasp the design elements that we sought and often re-directed us to more traditional “lines,” cabinetry, fixtures and colors.  However, after meeting Bob and seeing his portfolio of work, we thought that KraftMaster Renovations would be able to capture the “look” we wanted.

Our confidence was absolutely rewarded.  Maureen, our designer at KraftMaster, did a perfect job fusing our ideas together into a cohesive design that not only is beautiful, but also practical in its layout and space optimization.  Maureen also displayed incredible patience with us (or with me, to be more precise) as we modified some of the original design work after demolition revealed some issues with the house.  

As our project moved into the construction phase, we were exceptionally impressed by the craftsmanship and attention to detail of all the tradesmen.  Nick, Carlos and Camilo, the primary carpenters, are perfectionists.  This is evident in their own work, as well as their expectations of products purchased for the project—rejecting cabinets, tiles, hardware that were not perfect.  Danny, the primary plumber, and Chris, the primary electrician, provided excellent work that was obviously done with care and pride.  

Throughout the entire process, Bob was always involved and always responsive.  Early in the project he proposed alternatives that could save us some money, or told us that certain items were unnecessary expenses.  As the project advanced, he helped provide some creative solutions to structural issues that surfaced during demolition.  As the project was winding down, Bob made sure that we were pleased with everything, and made sure that any final adjustments were done to our satisfaction.  

Based on our experience, we highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations due to its quality of work and level of service.  And if your design preferences are more modern than traditional, you should absolutely meet with KraftMaster Renovations before starting your renovation or remodeling project."
5,"Bob Gockeler, Maureen Madigan and the entire KraftMaster Renovations Team is setting the standard that all contractors and home remodel companies should strive for.  ACCOUNTABILITY/PROFESSIONALISM/DOING THE RIGHT THING/EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE/EXPERTISE & A COMMITMENT TO STICKING TO WHAT WAS AGREED UPON are some of the A+ qualities we received in working with the KraftMaster Team.  Not only are we in love with our full bathroom remodel but we know with complete certainty knowing that the work was completed correctly.  The design concept for the small space was something we could not have envisioned and the end result was even more gorgeous that what we anticipated. One of things that impressed us most is that the team stayed on schedule!!  When I share that fact with friends and family they are blown away. Day 1 of the project they arrived when expected and left as agreed upon through the end of the project.  This is how they were able to standby the time frame we had originally discussed.  We really enjoyed working with the team and look forward to working with them again."
5,"I  highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations.  The toughest part of my kitchen renovation (May/June 2016) was packing up 60+ years of my mom's, grandmother's and my appliances and dishes to make way for the KraftMaster guys to get to work. I moved back into my childhood home after my mom passed away a few years prior to the renovation and was happy I chose Bob, Maureen and their team to turn my mom's kitchen into my own.  In keeping with the style of the mid-century Cape, we expanded the kitchen's storage capacity and enhanced its cottage ambiance with Shaker-style cabinetry finished in Marshmallow Cream. Subtle wood grain porcelain plank floor tiles, a beautiful Cambria Quartz countertop highlighted by a Pumice subway tile backsplash carried my 1941 Cape into the 21st century without sacrificing its mid-century modern footprint and charm.  Everyone who's seen it, can't believe the transformation. From day one, the guys showed up every day to gut, install, tile, drywall and plaster. The exceptionally skilled tilers often stayed late to finish a job.  It was such a pleasure working with designer Maureen, Bob, son Robbie and their team, that I am planning to continue working with them on upcoming jobs as well."
5,I recently had my kitchen and bathroom renovated by KraftMaster.  I'm thrilled with the redo.  Working the Kim (the designer) and Bob was exactly what I was looking for - guidance on various ideas with best practices incorporated.  The work crew obviously care about their work as everything was done with top notch quality.  They were flexible by working around some unique challenges.  Everything was planned well and the work went along smoothly.  KraftMaster was exactly the type of contractor that I was looking for.  Thank you to the entire team.  I love my new spaces.
5,"Having never undergone a major renovation, we were very apprehensive about the entire kitchen renovation process.  However, we can't say enough about Bob Gockeler and his entire team.  Bob and Kim were extremely involved, responsive, and helpful in every aspect of the project, from the design stage, to picking out fixtures, to the final small details that we would never have even thought of. They were beyond patient with all of our questions and went above and beyond to ensure that we were happy and confident in the choices that  were made.  The Crew that worked on the kitchen were professionals in every sense of the word.  Their work was top quality, they were friendly, left the work area clean and were very easy to have around.  The final result was beyond what we had hoped for.  Our kitchen is beautiful!  We would highly recommend working with Kraftmaster Renovations."
1,"Last Fall, my wife and I met with Bob and Kim a few times and our experience was so poor that I want to come back to this, because the overwhelmingly positive reviews on Houzz simply do not capture the complete picture on their business.  Rather than go through a detailed blow by blow of our experience, I think it’s more valuable to Houzz users that I just get to the bottom line.  In our view, Bob is a charming guy who markets a “design/build” offering in which customers end up over paying for the product they end up getting.  An argument could be made that you’re paying to have one stop shop and your hand held.  Having said that, the proposal we got from Bob was so generalized in terms of the design detail, that it was just not useful; if you want a high end product, when it comes to cabinetry and carpentry, it is ALL about the details.  So we decided to go shop.  Immediately, two things became clear.  One, most kitchen design specialists understand that you have to get very detailed in the design, unless you want a fairly pedestrian product.  Two, we would be able to get a much better quality cabinet/finish/overall product/project for, roughly speaking, 20 percent less than what was quoted by Bob.  Now that our project is 97% done, I can tell you by experience, that this is exactly what we achieved…we got a vastly better overall end product for substantially less money…"
5,"Bob, you may not realize this about me, but I am a perfectionist/interior design junkie.  Having been called on one or two occasions by people close to me that “I am a control freak”! (which I do take as a compliment)!!  Details, details, details, it’s my mantra – focusing on how I can manage the “what if’s” in any situation.  It gives me great comfort knowing my actions can affect the outcomes to situations I have control for.  So you can only imagine the amount of TRUST and CONFIDENCE I placed in you and your team!  After doing my due diligence research to assure I was going to get exactly what I had hoped and dreamed for (which happened to be 10 years in the making) – I was placing  “No pressure” on you -- right!!  Well, I can wholeheartedly state – You completely exceeded my expectations!! I feel like I am in a design magazine, every time I enter my kitchen.  It is truly breathtaking and extremely functional!!
Communication – it is a valuable cornerstone of your performance.  You kept us abreast of every situation – and they are bound to occur in a house that is over 50 years old.   Your suggestions for solutions gave us options, which appealed to my sensibilities. 
Your team of professionals were remarkable and it is our privilege to acknowledge them.
Kim’s design ideas along with her education on products and materials, gave us the intelligence to make important decisions.  She is so sweet, a pleasure to work with – I miss coming to the showroom to go over the plan with her.
Andrew’s work ethic is one for the record books!!  His boundless energy and determination to get my kitchen done was his ultimate priority!!  We felt so lucky to be in his infallible hands.  A true craftsman!!
Maynar and his cousin are flooring geniuses!!  Their talent of feathering in the new kitchen hardwood to the dining room is unbelievable.  The stain color is so rich and the steps are gorgeous.  
Robbie, your son, is a wonderful Project Manager.  His attention to detail is phenomenal, his diligence to protect our floors when the appliances arrived surely saved us from catastrophe.  He is a personable young man with great communication skills, apple didn’t fall far from the tree!  
Integrity, Quality, Experience, Reliable, Talented --  these are some of the words that we associate with KraftMaster Renovations.   To those who are embarking on this journey of home renovation, you couldn’t be in more capable hands.  I know you will be truly astonished with their capabilities – we are!!"
5,"Kitchen first and now the Living Room!

After Bob Gockeler and his incredible KraftMaster crew finished work on our Kitchen (see review from October 2015), it was only natural to move on to the living room. We've been busy relaxing in our new space, so it has taken a while to write this review.

Once again, everyone at KraftMaster exceeded expectations (while keeping the project within budget).  From Maureen and Kim's design suggestions and drawings to Robbie Gockeler's (Bob's son) project set-up and support, to the fine craftsmanship and attention to detail by Bob's subcontractors--not to mention our additions to the project--we were totally satisfied.  Can't wait to start work on the upstairs!"
5,"Review of Master Bath Renovation by Kraftmasters

Summary:
Very pleased with both the design and construction of the new master bath.
Kraftmasters was the most creative contractor we spoke with when trying to come up with a design to fit in our fairly difficult space constraints.
The work crew was attentive to our home and made every effort to minimize the disruption.
The workmanship was top notch.
The end result was just what we had hoped for.

Discussion:

We spoke with several contractors about renovating our master bath.  The problem was we had a dressing area with a sink and a closet and a separate bath with another sink, a toilet and a bath tub with shower.  We wanted a separate walk in shower, but the configuration of the rooms made it a real challenge to design a renovation without making undesirable concessions.  Bob and Kim were the only contractor/designers who said they could up with a plan to meet our needs, and they did.  We brainstormed with Bob and Kim and together we came up with a creative design that had a walk-in shower, and separate room for the toilet, a tub, and a reoriented closet with an entrance from the master bedroom rather than the bath.

Kim not only came up with the initial overall design, she provided very helpful input to assist us in making all the detailed design decisions.  Kim went shopping with us (at vendors recommended by Bob) for granite counter tops, floor tile, and bathroom fixtures.  We were able to select our cabinets right in Bob’s showroom in Chatham, and the cabinets are very attractive and well made.

The job was started promptly.  Bob arranged for the construction permit and scheduled the needed inspections.  The first step in the project was to put down protective material in the garage (where the construction material was stored), on the stairs, and in the master bedroom) to minimize the impact of the construction on the areas near the construction.  (It is construction so there is still going to be a considerable amount of dust and dirt, it is unavoidable).

Bob’s work crew were all friendly and knew what they were doing.  Tony, the foreman, did most of the plumbing and the layout of the framing.  He was very attentive to detail and consulted with us when he thought there was a decision to be made.  Yuri did a number of jobs and did them well, but he really showed his talent as the tile installer.  He did a super job installing the tile in the shower, the tile around the tub, and the river pebble floor in the shower.

Towards the end the job took a bit longer than anticipated as Bob had a number of jobs going at the same time and so the crew was not as available to us as they had been when the project was started.  Bob gave us a quote at the start of the project and the quote was only changed for areas that we agreed to.  The total cost of the project was somewhat over our initial budget, but we felt that it was worth the extra cost to get all of what we wanted.

Upon completion, we could not have been more pleased.  The workmanship was top notch, the design works as planned and is very pleasing to us, and all the detailed design decisions came together to create a Master Bath that we thoroughly enjoy."
5,"KraftMaster Renovations is an amazing company and we always enjoy working with them. They are extremely efficient, passionate, and they truly go above and beyond."
5,"Bob Gockeler and his team at KraftMaster Renovations are magicians.  After living in our 30 year old home for 12 years, we decided to undertake a massive master bath/closet renovation. This soon expanded to a new foyer staircase and hardwood floor refinishing. A three month project.  From the very first meeting with Bob's crack design team of Kim and Maureen, we were hooked.  Kim and Maureen were able to translate our conflicting, jumbled list of ideas into a workable plan- suggesting viable alternatives to our non workable ideas and giving rise to new thoughts through their design expertise. Once construction started, Andrew and Igor-  young men who were obviously master craftsmen, far ahead of what their ages would suggest, were on the job. They epitomized professionalism. Tremendously talented and a pleasure to have work in our home. When the time came to finish the hardwood floors and the newly rebuilt staircase in the foyer, Bob revealed his wizard of hard wood-  Eugene. Eugene is a Rembrandt in terms of matching new stain with that first put down 30 years ago.  They blend seamlessly.  Every day, Bob Gockeler was on site, reviewing and inspecting the progress, making sure that the work held up to his very high standards, which far surpassed ours as homeowners. When complete, the team retreated as if they had never been on site- the worksite was clean, all debris removed. Not a day goes by that we don't remark how much we love this new addition.  Thank you Bob."
5,The master bathroom is perfect. Nicole at Wayne Tile was knowledgable and professional. She helped me pick out the perfect carrera marble in one day. Andrew did an amazing job installing it. He is truly talented. We are very happy with the Perrin and Rowe fixtures that Kim helped us to select.
5,"All of the people associated with Kraftmaster are professional and give the utmost care to detail.  No item is too small to be given huge attention.  The utmost care was given to my entire home throughout our renovation.  Everyone was on time and always delivered exactly what they promised.  Every renovation causes an interruption to your normal household flow, this one was almost undetectable thanks to the entire crew.  Great Job Kraftmaster!"
5,"We have been doing business with KraftMaster Renovations/Kitchen Intuitions for several years. They are knowledgeable, efficient and  client-focused.
They are a pleasure to work with, and possess a professionalism that instills confidence.  GlassCrafters, Inc."
5,"My husband, Frank, and I decided it was time to completely remodel our kitchen.  We initially met with two different kitchen/bath designers.  For various reasons we were not satisfied with what they were proposing.  We had passed by Kitchen Intuitions in Chatham, NJ and decided to stop into their shop.  That is when we met owner, Bob Gockeler/KraftMasters Renovations.  We set up an appointment with Bob and his designer Kim to discuss our kitchen remodel.  We immediately knew that their professionalism, enthusiasm and creativity set them apart from the other kitchen companies!

They were extremely thorough in addressing all our kitchen needs.  They accompanied us when we chose the granite and backsplash.  Bob and Maureen made sure that we made the right lighting decisions.  Bob and his entire team always made sure there was a constant line of communication making the whole experience a pleasant one!

Once the demolition occurred they were extremely careful to keep the dust confined to the work area.   Within a very timely fashion, our new kitchen was completed!  The quality of the workmanship was superb!  For the first time after completing a project in our home, we can highly recommend KraftMasters Renovations!"
5,"The KraftMaster team was nothing short of top notch. I would hire them again in a heartbeat. From design thru finish Bob & Kim were professional, on time, on budget, creative, and very user friendly (text, email, etc). I felt that I was informed every step of the way. I was particularly impressed with their attention to detail and willingness to suggest alternatives that might not add to the value. Most contractors try to upsell you on specific items, where I felt like Kraftmaster was a partner in the process. A+ team, would highly recommend their work."
5,"We hired KraftMaster Renovations to design and install a new expanded kitchen in our 125 year-old Victorian home.  They did a wonderful job.  The design process was thorough and detailed.  The installation was quick and professional with outstanding attention to the detail of the moulding and trim.  Selection of granite and tile went so smoothly, I shouldn't have spent the hours on my own at the tile store looking at random tiles.  Our family loves the kitchen, which can now accommodate five sitting at the center island!"
5,"Kraftmaster is an excellent company providing their customers with everything they need to complete their kitchen or bathroom renovations. They are great to work with as well as open to innovative products and ideas which make any project come alive. From traditional elegance to cutting edge contempory, look no further than Kraftmaster Renovations!

5,"Kraftmaster Renovation is an excellent company to work with. Starting with the Owner Bob to every person on his team, they are all very professional.  
From the design phase all the way through final closeout they have one goal in mind which is: "" To give their clients the highest quality job possible""

As an Architect who has worked with Kraftmaster on dozens of projects, I always feel confident that the job is being done in accordance with plans and at a very high level of quality."
5,"We are currently collaborating with Bob and Kim on a new kitchen as a part of a whole-house renovation and addition in new Providence. The service and communication has been pleasant and professional. We look forward to the transformation.

Thank you!

5,"We are so thrilled with the way our kitchen turned out.  From the beginning, Bob and his team were very thoughtful, had great suggestions and asked tons of questions to build a kitchen according to the needs of our lifestyle.  The work they did was impeccable and kept us in the loop of when everything was going to be done.  We were nervous because of all the bad stories you hear about renovations, but we had no problems nor delays.  A much better experience than we could have imagined coupled with the end result, made us want to do more including our family room and powder room. We would recommend Kraftmaster for their thoroughness, communication and excellent work.  Thanks Bob and team!"
5,"Our experience with Kraftmaster Renovations has been fantastic. There are many people who own their own company, but Bob Gockeler is much more than an owner - he is a leader, and the people who work for him follow his example. Bob has so much integrity and is a person of his word. That might sound like fluff, but it's not - it's absolutely true. He has an amazing attention to detail, follows through on everything that he says he will do, and makes great suggestions and recommendations without being judgmental or pushy. What's so amazing - because it's so rare - is that he has managed to assemble an entire company of like-minded people, that truly care about the quality of their work.

Everyone who works for this company is great at what they do and is a true professional. If we had to pick 3 things that make Kraftmaster different from everyone else, we'd say: 1) They *genuinely care* about the quality of your project, from beginning to end; 2) Unlike so many construction companies that use subs, they employ their work crews, so you see the same teams of workers throughout your project; 3) Their work crews are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and put in a full day's work, every day, allowing your project to get done on time. 

We would not hesitate to use Kraftmaster again - in fact, we can't imagine using anyone else."
5,"Bob & Co. did an incredible transformation in our beautiful old 1800’s house with a 1970s era kitchen. Of all the people we interviewed, he was the most straight-forward with budget, deadlines, etc. 

What neither of us anticipated was the previous owners that did the 70s renovation on the kitchen did so without permits (or skill), and because of moisture damages, Bob had the fun job of figuring out how to gut the ENTIRE kitchen down to the dirt and up to the ceiling. I can’t stress enough how diligent and fair he was in figuring out how to achieve this without (completely) breaking the bank. We feel that if we would have chosen any other company, we would have been left in the dust, literally...  

In the process, we turned lemons into lemonade and moved some walls around, added a wet bar, switched the bath and Laundry rooms and he took on all the challenges gloriously! He’s not one to bark orders either while disgruntled workers do his bidding- he gets in there and does some of the work himself, not afraid of getting his hands dirty. He’s also really thoughtful about solving problems and I never saw him lose his cool during the entire process. His design partner Kim also helped us figure out the layout, colors, finishes, etc. and agreed to meet us at showrooms on weekends, nights or whenever we wanted.

Bob also worked really well with our flooring and insulation companies to time everything out and organize what needs to happen and when.

So now we have an incredibly beautiful new kitchen on a solid foundation, a new bathroom, laundry room, and because of removing a wall in another part of the house, a beautiful open concept living room. He even mounted our TV :)

We’ll definitely use Kraftmasters again for our future renovations (watch out 70s master bathroom!) and would highly recommend them to whoever needs a competent, friendly, hard-working-true-to-his-word contractor."
5,"KraftMaster Renovations remodeled our kitchen and did a fabulous job.  We interviewed several companies and Bob was able to give us our dream kitchen.  The KraftMaster team was very professional and neat.  They cleaned up each and every day, which is a major plus!  I would recommend KraftMaster to everyone!"
5,"Let me start by saying that the work that Bob and his team did on my kitchen, bathrooms, and various other rooms is simply beautiful. This is a team of professionals, ( and I stress the word professionals) , that go above and beyond to make sure that your vision comes to fruition. Never, at any time did we hear the words "" can't be done "". This company truly cares about the work they do and it shows. I also must add that during the entire process, every time we reached out to Bob with a question or concern he was always available to talk, which is hugely important while going thru a renovation. I would never under any circumstance consider doing any work in my house without Bob and KraftMaster leading the way!!"
5,"KraftMaster Renovations completed our kitchen renovation and we cannot be more delighted with the outcome.  They were able to open up the area between the kitchen and dining room as well as replacing a window with a French door to the outside to make for a beautiful and  functional space that has a better flow and is overall a big improvement to our quality of life in our house.  

Bob was always sensitive and responsive to any questions or suggestions and his designer, Robin, had the vision that  considered our desires while making sure that the final outcome was functional and lovely!

5,We had our kitchen renovated several years ago and in the process also had all the flooring in our home replaced with a laminate flooring.  The results are fantastic.  I love the new kitchen design layout which included a slight change to the flow through the house.  It's just awesome.  The quality and workmanship is great and was done within our budget.
5,"As the father of a severely mentally and physically handicapped son, we constantly face disappointment. When we required a bathroom to be  customized and build a walk in shower without any barriers, allowing our son to be wheeled directly in, the quotes and contractors we met with were either uninterested, lacked imagination or the credentials. Our last meeting was with Bob. He and his extraordinary crew of craftsmen spent hours discussing, drawing and reviewing the project. Regardless of the unexpected obstacles they faced, they remained steadfast and undeterred in ensuring the project remained on time and on budget. In fact, when a vendor priced a product too low, Kraftmaster kept to their contractual and ethical standards and automatically paid the higher price instead of handcuffing us and making us pay. Their team never missed a day, worked weekends, never left to work on another job and Bob constantly visited to ensure that no stone was left unturned. Furthermore, the bathroom will appeal to those who are non handicapped due to the innovative design and finishing details. No, I am not related to Bob. No, Bob did not pay me or promise to do work no-charge for this recommendation. There is often a disconnect in the construction world between work ethics and morals. Therefore, I wrote this because it doesn't cost a penny to say something nice for an excellent company  especially when it had such an important impact on our son's quality of life. If you don't believe me, visit Bob's site to see our bathroom or ask Bob to see our bathroom and meet our son.

5,"Bob and his team at KraftMaster Renovations did a brilliant job renovating my kitchen.  We went from a boxey dark, old kitchen to an open concept, bright, welcoming and highly functional space.  They listened to our needs and created a design that complements our lifestyle.  Some of my favorite features include a large 6 sided island with microwave drawer and hidden outlets, plenty of work space between the island and the sink/ stove area and great undercounter lighting.   Another highlight was taking down the wall between the kitchen and dining room and putting in a lovely arch which creates definition of the two spaces while giving an open feel to the space.  

Bob took us through his process, set our expectations, and delivered as promised.  Robin was fantastic in assisting with final design choices such as lighting, tile and even paint colors.  We absoutely love our new kitchen and we highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations."
5,I had my kitchen done through KraftMaster Renovations. Bob was great to work with and him and his team did an excellent job remodeling my kitchen. I was very happy with the work they did and they finished the job the same time they promised. I would highly recommend them.
4,"Bob and  his team renovated our master bath about a year ago and they did a fantastic job.  He is a true professional and worked very closely with us to ensure all of our needs were met and he even anticipated our need before we knew it.  He and his team were very respectful throughout the whole process.  I would not hesitate to use him again for our renovation needs.  He is a class act.

5,"KraftMaster was an excellent company to work with.  All of the employees were top notch.  Their attention-to-detail was the best.  From the initial meeting, to placing the order, to all the work that followed, all steps were perfectly executed.  Our kitchen & family room are the envy of many visitors now, thanks to KraftMaster.  You won't find a better company to work with!"
5,"The KraftMaster Team is truly the Dream Team of professionals when it comes to renovations. The project started right on time and throughout the process the team kept us abreast of what is next and what to expect. 

The craftsmen and designers are top notch. With the detail drawings done beautifully and to scale it is easy to envision the end product. The KMR team also came up with excellent ideas to maximized the use and functionality of the space. The KMR team is very patient, and helped us to choose the right materials on multiple shopping trips in perfectly matched colors.

We are very happy with the detailed work, the overall project, and overjoyed with the outcome.   We could not thank KMR more for the fabulous service!"
5,Kraftmaster did an amazing job creating custom beautiful cabinets for my unique layout and optimized the space. The installation was totally pro and whenever small obstacles came up they were all over it and came up with the best solutions. I would highly recommend them!!!
5,"I hired Bob to completely re-do our outdated kitchen. His crew was fantastic and trustworthy, and they produced beautiful work, even providing clever solutions to help us save money. We are planning to hire Bob and KraftMaster for future renovations!"
5,"We did a renovation of the whole main floor over the Summer. It was a pleasure to work with this company. Everything was possible, nothing was too much for them. It was a large project and it took a while but now that everything is done we are so happy! It worked out perfectly! Thanks to Bob, Robin and Andrew for all the hard work, the patience and the optimism."
5,"We got lucky in finding Bob. We were referred to him from another Professional in our area that left their previous job to go and work with KraftMaster. 

We loved the fact that Bob came over to our home to meet with us and be our ""go to"" person in our remodel. Bob knew all of the construction folks and I felt so secure allowing him into our home. 

Bob completely gutted our kitchen, and completely opened it up and gave us more room, bigger windows, and more natural light. 

Bob knew that I needed someone to spearhead the project. I didn't have enough time to spend all day giving direction. I don't know a lot about materials and the like, but I knew what I wanted the kitchen to look like. He even took me along for the shopping for materials. 

I would highly recommend Bob and KraftMaster to anyone seeking a remodel of their home!"
5,"Our dream master bathroom became a reality with thanks to the team at KraftMaster.  After researching countless hours online and meeting multiple contractors , we found KMR was the perfect fit for us. We had lots ideas, limited budget, and wanted to be an integral part of the renovation process. We were seeking a team that would hold our hand every step of the way, had impeccable attention to detail, provided the necessary thought leadership, and had well documented examples of master bathroom transformations, which is initially what lead us to their website.

Kim was very helpful and patient during the design and redesign process, as well as also with our visits to the showrooms and supply houses.  Andrii is not only a master at his construction trade, he is a true professional that is meticulous, friendly, and a very hard worker.  Each day, he would spent extra time for the clean up efforts and educating us on next steps. Robby ensured last minute supplies were delivered and was onsite managing all of our inspections in a friendly and personable fashion.

Bob and his team all possess the qualities that we rarely find in this business -  passionate, meticulous, friendly, neat, clean, best in class craftsmanship, and a trusted partner.  It's now been 3 months since our bathroom was transformed and it still feels as though we are visiting a spa. Our bathroom came out better than we ever could have imagined! Thanks to everyone at KraftMaster Renovations, Pete & Betsy"
5,"We are very happy with the end result of our project with Bob and his team.  We have an older (1920's) home and we knew we were in for a lot of (probably unpleasant) surprises.  Bob was never fazed by anything that came up during the project.  Five layers of ceiling demolished on the first day!  Needing to replace a toilet in the bathroom upstairs that turned out to be from 1935!  A basement full of plumbing in various stages of disintegration!  Not only Bob, but his entire team, were always positive, professional, and excited with the results of their work.  This was our first major renovation project and we are so happy with how it turned out!  His designers Robin and Jessica really helped to guide our choices, although I will say it is always best to have a good idea of what you want from the beginning.  Tony, Adam, and his entire team were also friendly and professional.

Our home has been transformed from a disjointed nightmare (prior addition with ""in-law suite/rental apartment"" had the only usable kitchen) to a floor plan that flows from one end of the ground floor to the other.  All of this was accomplished in keeping with the traditional feel of the house and with a reasonable budget, considering how much was accomplished!  A year ago I couldn't sit in the kitchen and type this review on my laptop and hear the kids if they went to another room--now all I have to do is lean back and I can see them.

We highly recommend Bob and would work with him again!"
5,"Bob and his team did an amazing job designing our new kitchen.  We now have a functional room with plenty of  work space and storage space and it is visually  stunning to boot.  From our initial meeting, through the design process and the installation, Bob, Robin and the rest of the team were easy to work with,  professional and dedicated (working right through Super Storm Sandy) to getting the job done right. Addtionally, the project came in on budget  and there were minimal bumps along the way. We couldn't be happier with the end result."
5,"It is atypical to find a company and owner/operator with the morals, ethics, standards of excellence, creativity and personality that meets or exceeds their representation or quotation. ""Customer service, fairness and peace of mind"" are typically not associated with contractors, let alone most companies. In Bob's case, these are exactly his characteristcs, and those of his workers. As the father of a handicapped son, I required a bathroom remodeling that had to be sophisticated yet practical; I required a crew that was professionally responsible and time-sensitive to the project. Bob is a hands-on, honorable, forthright gentleman. He is not a yes man in the sense of agreeing to anything and everything just to get a job. His input provokes thought and positive results. Unlike other contractors who model after magicians and disappear after the contract is signed, Bob was at the work site each day - morning, afternoon and sometimes evenings. His crew works for him and are craftsmen who take pride in their work and showed up on time each day, including weekends. Bob's contract was professional, specific, detailed and he did not nicke and dime for specific changes that most other contractors would have done so, for they are not interested in building long term relationships and either don't care or understand the value of word of mouth, which can either be a businessman's best friend or worst enemy. Needless to say, the result of the bathroom exceeded my expectations, the contract price did not and Bob is a man of his word and worthy of a phone call when you consider a home improvement project. I know that I will not hesitate to call him again in the future."
5,"I hired Bob to renovate, design, and rebuild my two bathrooms in my home. He did a great, high quality job. He worked with me every step of the way and made me feel very comfortable. Even with no planned budget he kept costs to a very reasonable level. Bob is a good fit if you are looking for high quality work and can accomodate anyones budget, high or low. His designers did a great job on everything."
5,"Kraftmaster Renovations and Bob Gockeler gave me the kitchen I have been dreaming about for years.

 Despite my anal attention to detail and last-minute plan changes, he never made me feel I was out of order in my opinions or proposals. 

He was just as excited as I was every step of the way... and especially with the finished product. His crew was clean, reliable and trustworthy."
5,"Our 50 year old kitchen needed to be gutted and we were looking for a contractor that did both the design work and construction. Once we met with Bob, we didn’t need to look further as his quiet enthusiasm and love for design and construction, customer service, and quality was evident throughout our discussion. Bob listened well to what we wanted, gave us several creative designs, was able to easily adjust as the work progressed and we requested changes. All throughout, he was upfront on costs and options, handled the unforeseen behind the wall structural and plumbing surprises, the two layers of ceilings, the 5 layers of floors, and guided us in making the many decisions on the design and materials. He never took shortcuts when faced with problems to fix, and took the extra time to do the job right.

His work crew was on time, very polite, professional, hard working and cleaned up the work area before leaving each night. Bob stayed on top of all the issues, was always accessible, and was patient in guiding us through the process always keeping our vision in mind. We couldn’t wait to get home each night, and see the progress. We thoroughly enjoyed working with Bob and his crew and are delighted with the great design, attention to detail, high quality work, and the resulting gorgeous, functional kitchen that was beyond our dream. Bob provides a high quality, customer focused service, and we would highly recommend him and his team."
5,"We moved from the city to the suburbs and we knew going in that we wanted to redo the kitchen and open up the living space, as soon as spring came around. Initially, we interviewed a couple architects, but all they wanted to do was to mold the house into their vision and not ours. Then we found Bob and he immediately knew what we wanted to do with the space and more importantly knew our design aesthetic. He came up with a great kitchen design, open floor plan and created the perfect space for us. Given our budget, we had resigned ourselves to semi-custom cabinetry, but Bob came through again. He was able to get us a fully custom kitchen with virtually no change in the budget. We gave Bob yet another challenge, a time challenge. We were expecting our second child and we needed all major construction to be done by time the new baby arrived. Bob came through with flying colors. All major construction was done ahead of schedule. We couldn't have been happier. Not only was the work done
in time, the quality of the work was top notch and the construction crew are professional and courteous.

There are several general contractors we could have gone with, but Bob is special. He is a great combination of an architect, kitchen designer and general contractor. He has a great breadth of knowledge when it comes to home construction and we couldn't have chosen better. We would definitely use him for any future home improvement projects and would highly recommend him to others.

5,"Let me start by simply saying that our Kitchen and other home improvements we had Bob work on are simply ""Amazing"". Bob himself is the perfect gentleman, and he has built a team of phenomenal people around him so that you always have the right expert on the right job. On a number of feature requests we made, Bob went above and beyond to discover people as far away as Indiana that could get the job done perfectly. He listened to all our detailed requests and made each and every one of them happen. Robin, his designer, is truly amazing and again she personally went above and beyond to ensure every little detail was perfect, even giving up substantial time to help us get the right products ordered for a part of the project that was outside her scope. Each and every one of the people that worked on the job were incredibly polite and professional - Andrew being a particular star. 

Just to keep the review real, not everything went completely smooth. To be fair we did add significant work to the job, but the job did take longer than we expected to complete. The difficulty of living in a house that is being renovated is not to be underestimated, but no pain - no gain. Now that we are comfortably in our new kitchen and home, everything was worth it and I can't imagine going through this process without a person like Bob, who was available 24/7 to lead the efforts. Bob is so much more than a contractor, his full service design & build solution is truly the white glove service, the standard which all other service providers should strive to deliver. He told us he would never say no & he didn't. Now that the project is done, he is still readily available to fix any minor issues, he is a man that stands over his work. 

Let me just finish by saying, at his very core, Bob is a good man, a perfectionist who is proud of the work he and his team does, a master of his art."
5,"I had a great experience with Bob! I found Bob after searching the web for Professionals near me. After meeting with a few different professionals Bob seemed the best for me and my project. 

He helped me through the entire process, helping me with each step and was great at explaining everything he was going to do, he even came shopping for ideas with me. I am not originally from the US and Bob was very patient in putting it in terms I would understand and explaining the things while comparing them to the European system for me!

This is our first home and our first remodel. Bob remodeled our bathrooms from the top down, as well as ripped out all of our piping that was very overdue for replacement. He treated everything with the best respect in our new home. 

I highly recommend Bob to anyone needing a great professional."
1,"Do not use this guy.  We paid him $2,000 in August, 2021 to come out and give us a design.  Said would be 2 weeks and would get back to us.  Finally, in November, 2021, he gave us a preliminary design.  We discussed some changes and never heard a word back.  We have called, sent emails, and text messages with no responses.  

$2,000 down the drain with nothing to show for it.  Very poor service.  Do not use him!"
5,Mike was great to work with in designing our pool and outdoor living space.  We had a vision of what we wanted but Mike was able to really bring it to life.  His experience came through in helping us make decisions for a final result that was better than we had imagined.
5,"We are extremely pleased with Mike’s design of our pool and backyard transformation. Mike overcame what we thought insurmountable challenges: trees, slope, line of sight, and dimension obstacles. He created a design that is more beautiful than we imagined and has the recreational features we were dreaming of.  Mike has the experience, expertise, and creativity that you are looking for.  We highly recommend Mike Farley."
5,"Mike is a great pool designer!  We didn't think we could fit everything we wanted in, but Mike made it work.  We only had to request one design change since his original was so good.  Mike discussed in-depth the steps that would happen.  Our nasty muddy backyard has been transformed into a backyard oasis.  We know have a sports pool, hot tub, basketball hoop, and a bbq/Green Egg to cook on. 

Mike truly understands how to take a space and make it into a functional living space. So glad we hired Mike for the biggest purchase of our lives."
5,Mike was great from start of design to finish.  Our pool is a difficult pool due to the grade on our lot but Mike was able to get what we wanted in there and his design is beautiful.  He also stepped in when another pool builder pulled out after 16 months of design and permitting.  Our pool needs to go in first due to the shape and size of our lot.  Mike saved our project!
5,"Backyard transformation. The most critical phase of any project is choosing the right designer/contractor to do the job right the first time. When I  started the process I contacted three contractors and had them send out their designer. It quickly became apparent that the scope and complexity of my project would require a special designer. So I started over and I started researching designers not just the contractors as I had done the first time a round. After several weeks of research I narrowed it down to two designers. Mike Farley was my first call. After speaking with Mike over the phone and answering some of his questions I was confident I had found my designer. I decided I would wait until we met in person to make my final decision. Once I met Mike in person and walked the site of the project, I was 100% confident in his ability and knowledge. This was a totally different experience than I had with the other three designers. I knew I had found my designer and Contractor and we begin the process. The process has been seamless, from the initial design phase through the revisions and the selection process Mike has been there to answer all my questions and also offer his opinion and expertise which has made this a great experience. If you’re looking for a  world class designer look no further Mike Farley is your guy."
5,"We hired Mike to do our backyard design and we were not disappointed! We had gone through several designs with different pool companies but were not drawn to any that we saw. When we hired Mike, he had a unique process of meeting with us first and asking a lot of questions to get to know our vision and figure out our budget first. What he came back with blew us away.  He is unique in that he listens to what you want and will create just that, but add in elements that you may not have thought of. For us it was the handing day bed! Thanks for a beautiful design Mike!  - Ginny B."
5,"Highly recommend Mike for your pool designs.  He is very detail oriented and recommends/designs your outdoor living area to match your needs and intended use:  decking, hot tub, pool, pool type and size, equipment.  Most importantly, Mike was responsive and worked in a timely manner to for design-completion in order to facilitate timely construction.  I greatly appreciate his work as he transformed our backyard to a great outdoor living area.  John"
5,"Very professional on all fronts! 

Claffey Pools plays at the top of the construction game!

Mike F is in his craft is true craftsmen ! 

I would say this was a big decision but in downtown Grapevine I would not have choose anyone else ! 

This is my 2nd pool I have built with Claffey and honestly i just would not go anywhere else!

5,"The design of our swimming pool, outdoor living area and firepit way exceeded our expectations. Mike listened closely to our wants in the very beginning and transformed them into a really beautiful backyard environment! Thank You Mike!"
5,"We can't begin to say what a pleasure it is to work with Mike Farley and have him transform our backyard into the paradise that we were looking for.  The design process that he uses, where he gets to know you and what you are looking for and then turns that into reality is truly amazing!  Mike is a master of listening to you and what your desires are, understanding your budget, and bringing it all together into a remarkable design.   He highlighted pros and cons of different aspects, features and functionality of the pool so that we could make informed decisions.  Mike's process lets you iterate on your design(s) and to ensure you get the pool of your dreams.  Mike was masterful at taking our desires and transforming our blank slate into our resort paradise.  We have already recommended Mike to one of our neighbors and would recommend him to anyone!"
5,Mike did a terrific job throughout the whole process from start of design to completion of construction.  His design ideas to complement the house design and property layout were excellent.  He answered all of our questions and communicated well with the construction crew.  Exceeded our expectations!!
