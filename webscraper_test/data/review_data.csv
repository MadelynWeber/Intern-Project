5,My kitchen remodel is so beautiful!  The project manager communicated effectively so were kept informed of timelines and next steps. Our designer listed to what we wanted and helped us create our dream kitchen! All of the contractors were very professional and treated my home respectively.
5,"I had an absolute blast doing my kitchen remodel with Beatris Gross. she was absolutely fantastic. Confident, professional, knowledgeable, and with a real eye for design choices, the kitchen looks even better than I would have hoped. she had a real knack for not only answering all of my questions, but taking what my wife and I wanted to do with our kitchen and making it part of the whole project. Absolutely I will be working with her again for any remodeling projects."
5,"Treeium and specifically Beatris Gross and her entire team are worth every penny. No matter the size of the project you can tell they all care about the details and doing things right the first time. I never had to wonder if this work was up to code. They are experts and artists in what they do and every single crew was respectful, skilled, and honest. We have found our contractor for every other project. We needed someone to guide us through the kitchen renovation process and we found that in Beatris. We love our new kitchen and can’t wait for future work!"
5,"Our home renovation couldn’t have been completed without the great work from Treeium. We added 400+ sq ft to our home, turning it from a 3 bed/2bath to 4 bed/2 bath, large open concept with new kitchen & dining room. Like any home reno, there were some unexpected items, but Sam & the team worked with us to prioritize what we wanted and needed. We love how everything turned out!! I highly recommend this team!"
1,"Treeium recently completed the remodel of a portion of my home and a detached garage to create two apartments (ADUs). Unfortunately, my experience was very negative and fraught with tension, disagreement, and arguments. Most importantly, the project was scheduled to be completed in 3.5 months but took over 7 months to complete, without a reasonable cause for the delay. Additionally, they repeatedly touted their years of experience and expertise, which caused me great concern when I discovered that their contract’s payment schedule forced me to pay large sums of money for work that had not been completed. On a positive note, their sales pitch and marketing are exceptional."
5,"We used Treeium for a complete new kitchen and bathroom. From the  start to the finish, we were guided along each step of the way by Beatris, the wonderful project manager, who worked on it! She was there to assist us with every single decision that we had to make! She gave us details about each product and offered excellent suggestions, and then allowed us to make the final decision. She is very knowledgeable about everything that her job entails and extremely precise with even the small details, thus assuring that the end results will be exceptional!! We loved her for that! Over the duration of the project, she also showed kindness and consideration in that she willingly made adjustments to do things at a later time of the day to suit our schedule,  and even assisted us in getting a driving cart in the stores when necessary, due to health issues! Overall, we think that Beatris went ‘above and beyond’ the requirements of her job, and we are absolutely pleased with the job done! We would definitely recommend Treeium and Beatris to everyone!!! We are so delighted to have a beautiful new kitchen and bathroom!"
5,"Treeium is awesome! Seriously, the most incredible discovery I've made. We had a complex project (2 walls, a bi-fold door, and glass) and Treeium handled it flawlessly. Several other larger companies that I contacted stated that they would be unable to come in for another week, implying that someone would be sleeping in the living room, and that their charges were significantly higher without tax. Treeium was cost effective, well-organized, and extremely efficient. Sebastian phoned back to confirm and even offered to come earlier in the day on Saturday, recognizing that work into the afternoon/evening would cause complications in our building. Sebastian and his team performed miracles in a matter of hours, and the wall beyond our expectations. We were blown away by their professionalism and friendliness, especially on such a frantic move-in day.

After the wall was done, we intended to add plexiglass to the top but were unable to do so due to a lack of materials. Sebastian contacted the next day to set a time for early Monday morning to come finish the repair and allow me to continue working later in the day. He did a wonderful job, and it gives even more privacy while maintaining the room's natural light.

Sebastian and the entire team at Treeium did an excellent job! Thank you guys!"
5,"We've had an amazing experience with Treeium. In and out in a flash with a flawless product. We've utilized them on numerous occasions for large-scale projects and they've always started and finished on schedule. After the workers departed one of the projects, I identified a minor issue that needed to be addressed. I contacted Sebastian and he answered instantly and arrived the next day to resolve the issue without charging me further fees. Impeccable service and overall great quality products."
4,Eran was friendly and professional from the beginning.  I loved the 3D design at the beginning.  It allowed us to be more specific in the material selections.  It was really a great experience working with Eran and Treeium.  And the bathroom looked even more beautiful than we imagined. I highly recommend them both for any future remodels.
5,"Treeium did everything that they promised to do and did it in less time than originally estimated.  Our Project Manager AmirTeymouri was nothing short of amazing.  He stopped by the project every day just to check in and make sure we didn't have any questions.  Not only that but he always answered my calls or texts within a few minutes...even on Saturday or after hours.  

I have heard (and had) horror stories about contractors but not the case with Treeium. I can assure you that Amir will be our only call when we are ready for the next project."
5,"There was a leak from the shower pipes that went unnoticed for months. When discovered, the damage was too extensive so we decided to bite the bullet and remodel. Treeium outperformed my expectations with the bathroom remodeling project. I had the pleasure to work with Beatris Gross, who exemplifies the meaning of customer service and delivers on her commitments. She was attentive to all of my inquiries, responding immediately. I was 400 miles away during the remodel and she kept me apprised at every single step through phone calls, texts and pictures. I appreciated her remodeling expertise and eye for detail. The workers on the remodel are masters of their crafts, not jacks of all trades. This gives me the assurance the work was done correctly. No more leaks! The project was finished within the time frame stated and I am very pleased with the result. I highly recommend Beatris.  And I would definitely work with her again."
5,"they were wonder to work with. I would recommend them without hesitation. They were professional, pleasant, and responsive. ok ok"
5,"Farid and his team from Treeium did an excellent job remodeling our bathroom. The end result was better than we imagined. Farid was responsive, completed the job on time and there weren’t any surprises in cost. We will use Farid Ghaheri and his team when we are ready to remodel our kitchen."
1,"SPENT $$$ - GOT NOWHERE!!!!  I had an awful experience with this company.  They were paid for their professional expertise to assess whether a simple balcony could be built.  Upon their assurance that it could be, I engaged upon the next phase of the project.  After several months and additional payment, they informed me that it could not be done.  Rather than taking responsibility for their error and refunding the second payment, they decided to double down and charge me more!!  UNETHICAL, UNREASONABLE, UNRELIABLE."
5,"We had a storage room off the garage converted to a studio apartment. The project managers Dorel Zander and Lior Lazrovich, their  architect, designers, and work crews were friendly and excellent at what they do.  Even with the issues that the City raised about the property and physical challenges,  they were willing to work with us, within our budget, to get the job completed within the time frame we were working with.  Dorel and Lior stayed in constant contact with us throughout the project, particularly with the stages of the remodel and the city inspections. They were always very responsive to any questions or concerns we had and addressed them fully.   The bathroom and kitchenette look terrific.  Very pleased with the overall experience."
5,The company with Avram and Eran Dukeman were very helpful in guiding us through the entire project remodeling our entire kitchen and 2 bathrooms. They were always clear about choices to be made and when changes were necessary. They also tended to spot problems before we noticed them. Good guidance all through the entire project.
2,"I would steer clear of this company.  They started my kitchen remodel August 3 and it is October 29 and it is not yet complete.  There have been 28 working days that there were no workers at the house.  The foreman never comes around nor does the project manager.    Several times the inspector came to the house and no one from Treeium was there to meet them.  I asked for my concerns to be escalated and was told management were all busy.  The communication from the project manager to the workers is horrible.  The cabinet guys had no idea we were to have toe-kick drawers or certain pull-outs.  I asked one of the workers, who is giving you direction and they indicated the direction was coming from me. I call the phone number and there is an option to select 3 to discuss concerns with a project, but when you select 3 you receive an error message and it disconnects you. The only saving grace is that the kitchen looks really nice and I am pleased with it but the process to get there was horrible!"
5,"Treeium remodeled two of our bathrooms and we couldn't be more pleased with the result. Everything was completed professionally, on time and within our budget. Dorel Zender is excellent as a project manager. He is client focused, very professional and has an excellent demeanor for working with people anxious about having work done on their home. 

We are currently using Treeium to convert a window in one of our bedrooms into a sliding glass door along with adding a deck to allow us better access to our yard. Everything has been going well.

I definitely recommend Treeium and you would be fortunate to have Dorel as your project manager."
5,"Our home was in desperate need of a remodel, it needed everything, new roof, flooring, re wire,  re plumb, four bathrooms, game room and a kitchen. Basically our home was a gut job.  I had been dreaming of a remodel for years. Needless to say we were nervous about hiring a company that could handle such a big project. After talking to numerous contractors I was becoming discouraged, no real quotes and no time lines.  Then I discovered Treeium and knew I had found a company that I could trust with a 1/2 million Dollar renovation.
Shahar Algazy has been nothing short of amazing, treating our home like his own and diligently keeping everything on time and on budget, if not Below.  Everyday since we began Shahar has had a 10 man crew on the job, practically unheard  of with most companies. When it came time to upgrade the electric panel we were faced with the possible need to destroy a large portion of  our yard and cut down a  beautiful and stately tree that is a major feature in our yard. Shahar could have left it at that but he went the extra  mile to find a better solution. Shahar saved us 30K and our beloved ficus tree.
We continue to be impressed with Treeium's customer service and communication. The Treeium portal is very easy to navigate and keeps everything clear and organized. We love the gallery that lets our friends and family keep track of the  progress. Great work Treeium and Shahar Algazy for talking such good care of our home."
5,"My wife and I were looking to completely open up our kitchen and bring into a modern aesthetic. As you can see in the pictures, we had a very cramped galley style kitchen with 80s style red oak and old appliances.  

Our project managers, Lior Lazarovich and Dorel Zander, were very easy to work with and understood what we were looking for and made sure to incorporate our needs throughout the design. They were able to remove two major walls to open up the kitchen, and their designer Natali did an amazing job of reconfiguring the cabinets to give us an ample amount of storage.

Overall, I'd highly recommend working with Treeium, and specifically with Lior and Dorel.  They were very professional, always attentive to our numerous texts and concerns even on the weekends (we were those annoying clients lol). They handled everything with an easy going nature that was straightforward and honest. We look forward to working with them again on any projects we have in the future! Thanks guys"
5,"Having never done such a major project, I was more than a little apprehensive about the timeline, but my project manager Beatris Gross made sure everything kept moving.  It took just one month from start to finish.  Everyone who worked on my kitchen was knowledgeable and professional.  Beatris spent hours helping me choose just the right materials to complete my vision for a new kitchen.  I would definitely recommend this company."
5,"Three months ago we finished our project with Treeium, successfully.
Farid & Gabriel played a fundamental role during the entire process, which included dealing with architects, engineers, city codes and builders. They both were very accommodating, patient and extremely professional.  
Our project was a major home remodel (90%). It took less than five months from the moment the plans were approved to completion.
We hired Treeium to ensure our home was built structurally safe & sound, and that’s what they delivered. Have already recommended them to several people."
5,"We recently remodeled our master bathroom.  We gutted the entire space and put in both a half bath and a full master.  We could not have been more pleased with Treeium, the contractor we worked with on this project.  We recommend them highly, and plan to have them return to do our kitchen!  Contract Treeium for all your remodeling needs.  855.833.8733 and ask for Dorel or Lior."
5,"My wife and I are retired and decided to invest in our home of 35 years in Irvine by upgrading all three bathrooms. We had remodeled them only once before and did not have much money at the time and we were determined to get it right this time.

We decided against hiring an interior designer so we interviewed contractors that were larger firms with good resources like a Project Manager that would come onsite weekly and see the project thru from beginning to end. We knew we would pay a little more for that level of service. We decided on Treeium after meeting a few times with our Project Manager Amir Teymouri.

Amir made us really comfortable with the depth of his remodel knowledge, gave us very credible  design idea’s  and excelled at both his verbal and written communications. That combined with Treeium’s size ($100M in annual sales), discounts with major suppliers of bath fixtures  and tile Were ket you decision along with the excellent ratings on Yelp, Houzz etc. So, we signed a contract for all 3 bathrooms with Amir.

Amir did exactly as he said he would by monitoring his crews work, visiting our home several times a week to check on progress, ask us about how we liked the work and communicating to us clearly as to schedule and what materials or decisions were needed (and when) from us.

Amir has terrific contacts with key suppliers like bathroom fixtures, tile stores, shower enclosures etc…. and those relationships really helped when issues would present themselves. For example, our supplier for the master bath sold us the wrong rough-in valve (which was already installed and tiled over) for the filler tube for our soaker tub. Amir handled all the conversations with the supplier and presented us with 3 different alternative replacements for the tube filler that would fit the already installed rough-in valve.
 Treeium is a very good company but as always its the people that make the difference. In my opinion Amir is a very good Project Manager and has a very good team supporting him. I would highly recommend Treeium and especially Amir Teymouri for your home remodel needs.

Bottom line, could not be happier with the final competition of all 3 bathrooms!  I was so satisfied mid-way with through the project I signed another contract to have Treeium paint the exterior of my house and they did a terrific job on that as well."
5,"Treeium is not necessarily the most cost efficient company I’d you shop around, but you certainly get what you pay for with contractors. As a company, it was very professional, the portal is great, you have licensed contractors that are insured at all times. Our process was timely, transparent and on budget which is all we can ask for. 
My review is actually in support of our project manager/contractor Amir. He went above and beyond for our project before, during and after construction. He was available for questions at all hours, gave honest feedback and worked with us to find great solutions. Our kitchen resurfacing was painless and Amir made sure it was finished to perfection down to the last detail. 

We have recommended Amir (and therefore Treeium) to several colleagues and friends and would certainly recommend him and the Treeium team to anyone looking for painless remodeling."
5,"Lior Lazarovich is an outstanding project manager. He has really looked out for me throughout the re-modal process. His daily communication was indispensable. I looked forward to the texts, they kept me apprised every step of the way. Lior Lazarovich, built trust with his strong communication and  his attention to detail. He made me feel relaxed through the process and I am very happy and excited by the results. My kitchen is everything I could have asked for.

If I ever do another re-modal I would just call Lior."
5,"We recently had a four season sunroom addition built at our house. Our project was managed by Medhi Heshmati and Amir Teymouri, and we couldn't have asked for more professional and communicative project managers. From the start, they were with us, helping us plan out our sunroom to our budget, and explaining all the steps and processes involved. They let us know the approximate timeline for start of construction, and what would be involved, and provided suggestions on best practices that would result in a highest end quality for our budget. The build team was professional and always courteous, and were very receptive and responsive to any questions and issues we had. From start to finish, the project was streamlined, and on target, and we are very satisfied with the end result. I will definitely be calling up Mehdi and Amir for future remodels, and would not hesitate to recommend them to friends and family."
5,"Thanks to Lior Lazarovich, Dorel Zander and the Treeium team for the transformation of my parents home! The timeline and communication throughout the remodel process was great! Especially with my busy schedule. All the work was very efficient and thorough. Very satisfied! Would recommend to anyone looking to remodel."
5,"Last November, I started calling around to get some quotes for remodeling my master bathroom.  I'd set a budget and wanted to plan ahead to keep the project on track.  I'd calculated that the best time for the work to begin would be February/March 2020.   Some of the contractors I called turned me down because the work wouldn't be starting immediately.  But when I called Treeium, the response couldn't have been more different.   

Right from our first meeting, project managers Shahar ""Shawn"" Algazy and Guy Borenstein listened to my wish-list, got a sense of my aesthetic, and started making suggestions to realize my vision.  Their advice about materials and 3D rendering of the design were especially reassuring for someone undertaking a remodel on this scale for the first time.

The whole process has unfolded so smoothly.   I've been kept in the loop every step of the way.   Shahar in particular has stopped by regularly to make sure everything has been going to plan.  The crew has been consistently on time, amazingly friendly and polite and very considerate in cleaning up at the end of each day.    The team effort and spirit at Treeium is truly outstanding -- everyone I've talked with has contributed to realizing this vision.  Shahar and Guy are truly amazing!  I'm extremely grateful and very happy to be part of the Treeium family.   Thoroughly recommended!"
5,"Medhi was great to work with. He answered all my questions and provided a detailed scope of work on the bid. Adjusted it multiple times to meet my needs before even signing a contract. His foreman and crew were efficient and courteous. They completed the job on ahead of schedule and passed all inspections with ease. the remodel of our bathroom was amazing, I would recommend them to anybody."
5,"A few months after our massive job was completed (new electrical, new walls, new floors, new doors, new HVAC, etc) we noticed that a couple of our barn doors were starting to stick a bit. When we reached out to Gina at Treeium, she had a crew out to us the next business day to take care of it, free of charge.

The crew was in and out and took care of the two doors without any fuss. We really appreciated that Treeium came out so quickly (and for free) in order to make sure we were fully satisfied with their work."
5,"Treeium is great to work with. Professional, knowledgeable and an overall great experience. Guy, Shahar, Eli and Maya are my team.  They have earned my trust as we are halfway through my complete remodel and addition.  I can sleep better knowing my home is in their hands."
5,"I worked with Eli at Treeium over 3 1/2 months - remodeling two bathrooms. From our first conversation to the last, Eli was a pleasure to work with and Treeium did not disappoint! Our remodeling was (IMHO) pretty extensive -- new sinks, new vanities, new toilets, new lighting, new stall shower, new floors, new tile, and so on. The only thing we didn't replace was the bathtub - because Eli recognized that it could be refinished and look like new (which it did!!). We also did some structural work (reconfiguring a closet and also changing a doorway). I had a million decisions to make in the process of selecting materials, tile, flooring, countertops, etc. -- and so I was in steady contact with Eli to make sure what I was picking out would meet code requirements and would work within the constraints of our bathrooms (e.g., making sure the stall shower wasn't too large for the space). He was always fast in responding, patient in answering my questions, and helpful in providing the necessary information. Treeium's team was also great -- from the folks who handled the loan, to the foreman of the job, to the workers who did the actual work. Everyone was friendly, competent, FAST, and professional. On many days, I was out of town and I had no hesitation leaving them a key in a lock box and letting them work without my actually being there. If they ran into a problem or a question, they contact me -- so I never had to worry that they would make a decision in my absence that I wouldn't agree with. Eli said the first bathroom would take 3 weeks and the second (master) bathroom would take 4 weeks. And he was true to his word! Even allowing for ""wasted"" days due to holidays or waiting for city inspections, the projects were complete in 7 weeks. I would definitely work with Treeium again and with Eli, in particular!"
5,"We just had two bathrooms remodeled by Treeium.  Lior, the project manager, made sure that all was on schedule -- the crews, the suppliers and us.  We are very happy with the new bathrooms in our home.

 

The contract said the job would be done in 7-8 weeks; it was done in 5 weeks.  Lior is a “taskmaster” in the best sense of the word.  He is also a cheerleader.  He kept us all “in line” by reminding us of our responsibilities. He was at the site every day.  His crew was friendly, conscientious, and efficient.

 

We live approximately seven hours drive from the construction site and had several trips planned during the reconstruction.  Prior to starting the project, we were supplied detailed schematics as well as a designer’s full color rendering of what the bathrooms would look like on completion.  As a result, we were able to follow the work via skype or photos which Lior supplied daily.  We made minor changes along the way.  Lior was always positive and gave great advice in relation to costs etc..  We were told exactly how much the project (or changes we made) would cost there were no surprises when the work was completed.   

 

We are more than happy with the work done by Treeium.  We plan to keep on using Treeium for the rest of our renovations because of the fine work done by the crews and the direction of Lior, the project manager."
5,"This was my first remodel.  I was very fortunate to find Amir of Treeium to do my master bathroom renovation.

From the very first meeting with Amir I knew this was the right fit.  He was told me about the company, showed me various jobs he was in charge of as the project manager.  He walked me through the process and made me feel confident that Treeium and Amir were right for the job.

The remodel went like clockwork and was completed ON TIME!! Amir was at the job site almost daily and was always available by text or phone, including weekends and holidays! When in doubt I relied upon his expertise and he never steered my wrong. Amir kept me informed throughout the process. He always told me at the close of work what the next day would be. I appreciated his attention to detail and his honesty.  I always felt I was in good hands.

Not only is Amir wonderful but so are his team.  They were very polite, cordial and without too much interference with my day.  They cleaned up daily and the dust was minimal due to the plastic tarp taped to adjoining rooms. I have a small dog and they were always careful to keep the front door closed so she would not escape.  

After hearing all the horror stories from others about a remodel I feel very lucky to have found Amir. He made the remodel flow easily and flawlessly. If I need any renovations in the future I will call Amir."
5,We hired Treeium to do our second story bedroom and bathroom addition. It was a big job for us and took almost 6 months. Beatris Gross was our project manager and we were so grateful for her! She ensured the work be done right and to our liking on everything. She always responded to our phone calls and texts immediately. We have small children and she was very careful to ensure the home was safe the whole time. Beatris has great taste and helped us pick beautiful finishes for our room. I highly recommend asking for her when you do your job. She was a joy to work with!
5,"Guy has been very good, very thrall with great project management and communication. He is always checking on the project and the progress, my wife Merrillyn and I have been very pleased with Guy Breuer. He is an excellent project manager. Thank you for the great experience."
5,"The company was very professional
And I trusted them above the other five that came out to give me an estimate and they were competitive"
5,"We are just finishing up a bathroom remodel with Treeium.  Etel Littman was our project manager and from the very first meeting Etel was just fantastic.  She listened to our fuzzy ideas and asked great clarifying questions to focus on what we really wanted.  This is our first remodel experience and she made it wonderful and easy.  She really walked us through the process the whole way and helped us protect ourselves from less honest contractors.  Our final inspection is tomorrow and the bathroom is just perfect.  The work quality was fabulous and the team of workers were always polite, conscientious, and hard working.  It was such a great process that I recommended Etel and Treeium to my mother who also wants to remodel her bathroom. I trust Etel to do a great job and to live up to my mother’s demands.  If you are looking to remodel your home, Treeium is just a great company."
5,"Guy Breuer is an awesome project manager for Treeium!  He is very knowledgeable, friendly, and attends to my questions in a timely manner.  He checks in frequently with me, both by phone and email, to keep me apprised of my bathroom remodel's progress.  Treeium has been a great choice for me and I highly recommend Treeium to anyone needing remodeling done!"
5,"The whole Treeium team was terrific.  Guy Breuer was the project manager.  Big kudos....on time, within scope and on budget.  Can't ask for more, except for the finished product which has had nothing but rave reviews from everyone who's seen the kitchen."
5,"Forbes magazine was right, that is all I got to say ! If you are looking to make your home more efficient , to lower your costs overall from your home, this is where you will make the final decision. Treeium was referred to me by neighbor, in Sherman Oaks, we really help each other out, to make sure our community and our homes look and live on it's best. My home was over 70 Years old, and only thing I did was change attic insulation once, no difference, Treeium came , showed me suggestions, and I ended up going with an self efficient smart home,  my living Costs from my home have dropped a drastic 35 percent in costs, I didnt think this was possible, but they made it possible, on top of that,  they went ahead and planted a tree for remodeling my home to an efficient environment friendly home,they really do care about the environment just like it mentioned in the article, I must say they deserve 10 stars not 5, thank you once again for educating me and helping my family live a better and more earth friendly life."
5,"We worked with Shahar Algazy and Maya Orlova on our kitchen, bath and wet bar remodel.  Treeium is proactive, on time, within budget and provides high quality work. Having a large team and industry network enabled them to keep the project moving forward."
5,"Treeium is an excellent company that I have been working with, but the individual that should be recognized by everyone is Etel Littman because of her fantastic customer service that continues to drive Treeium to success. I am thankful for Etel’s high quality customer service she never lets me down or anyone that I know. An example of her excellent service was her knowledge in design and ability to work efficiently with me in providing best pricing and quality material to all customers on time."
5,"We are working with Etel from Treeium. She has been a great project manager for us thus far. She has been very approachable, available, and has helped guide us in our ongoing kitchen remodel."
5,"My husband and I got bids from 7 contractors and decided to move forward with our kitchen remodel with Treeium. A few of the quotes came in at similar prices so what won us over was our project manager, Etel Littman. From the first meeting until now, communication has been clear and straightforward. She was one of the only people to educate us on how to do our homework on a contractor - together we went onto the CSLB website to compare all the companies and overall we liked what Treeium has to offer. Through the process of picking our materials, Etel has also been very flexible and accommodating, meeting us at tile stores, trying to find us the best pricing, and even dropping off samples to our home on a Sunday. Demo starts soon and I'm looking forward to the kitchen of our dreams! I feel our kitchen will be in good hands with this company and project manager."
5,"I used Guy Borenstein from Treeium for a huge project last year, I had my entire kitchen and living room remodeled and upgraded. I was extremely happy with the quality of their work and the caliber of all the workmen that Guy Borenstein has on his team.  Their work exceeded all my expectations! 
I am in the process of remodeling my back yard and bbq area and Guy Borenstein is back to the drawing board!  There is no other contractor I will work with.
Can't wait to see the end result!"
5,"The 60-year old sink in our rental property required serious work. Because they seemed to be the most sincere about fixing our problem, we hired Treeium, Inc. in Valley Village to do the work. Guy Borenstein was the Project Manager and Elizabeth Camarena was the site supervisor. Like most projects, we anticipated a certain level of anxiety until the job was complete but Guy and Elizabeth made this project virtually stress-free for us. The finished work is beautiful and, when we do further upgrades, we will consider Treeium as our first choice."
5,Treeium is an excellent company and Guy Borenstein is an amazing contractor. The company truly cares about their clients and tries their best to be respectful and accommodating during what can be a very difficult time. I have done many projects with Treeium and Guy Borenstein and I look forward to building the ADU that is our next project. I know it will be done with excellent quality given the multiple projects I have already done with Guy and Treeium!
5,"Being our first remodel, my husband and I were a bit anxious about the whole process. From the beginning, the project manager with Treeium, Etel Littman, was great! She was very informative and thoroughly explained what to expect.  Also, she provided great ideas, from the materials, colors and design. Etel was super attentive to details and she has been a pleasure to work with. We look forward to our new home!"
5,"I’ve worked with Treeium on three different projects including two bath remodels and the best thing about them is their desire to accommodate the needs and requests of the customer. They also have great post project support.  In the last project, the project managers Farid Ghaheri and Amir Teimouri were accommodating, flexible and patient. In addition, Jose Castillo who did all the work was very patient and professional. Jose does high quality work and has great attention to detail.  Treeium is a good choice because of their customer service and post project support."
5,Treeium was professional and really cared about our satisfaction through the entire process. From my initial contact they were very responsive. I started contacting different places to learn about bathroom and kitchen remodeling and decided to give Treeium a call. I was super pleased with my initial phone consultation and decided to schedule to have a field estimator out to see the projects and provide a bid. The estimator was very friendly and had a ton of knowledge in the processes and different bathroom and kitchen upgrades available. After meeting with a couple of establishments it was clear to us that Treeium was the company for our projects. The crew and project manager were absolute professionals. We are 100% satisfied and recommend Treeium to our family and friends. Thank you!
5,"I have a small project with Treeium. My project manager is Shahar Algazy. They really give me a good help to finish my project. I owned an apartment since August 2018. I hired a contractor right after I own the place, but they took my deposit and did not do anything for 6 months, which made me into a really bad situation. Then I found Treeium on Yelp. Lucky, they went in the next day after I contact them and give me a big help. My HOA is so hard to communicate. It took us a month to start the project. Shahar even went to my HOA meeting to explain how our project going to do (I have never heard that any contractor will come to the meet, especially for a small project.) Finally, we got the approval letter and start the project. Since then everything goes very smooth. Shahar come almost everyday to see how the work is going. I must mention Roy and his buddy. They do everything perfectly, even surprise the inspector. They use all good and expensive things to make sure everything they did is in a perfect shape. Then the patching guys and painting guys came in after. To be honors the patching guys and painting guys are just alright (nothing bad, I think I just spoiled). However, they still help me a lot on those small projects which belong to myself and not on the contract for free. After a month working. My apartment finally turns into what I was looking for. Shahar is a nice project manager. As a contractor he gave me a lot of suggestions from the customer side, which I believe he can make bigger money without those suggestion. To be the truth, Shahar becomes my friend instead of just a project manager. If you are looking for a contractor. Talk to Treeium and ask Shahar as your project manager. You won’t find any project manager who will pick up your phone almost 24/7 and tell you what the best option is and what the cheapest option is to achieve your goal. Also, if possible, ask Shahar to bring Roy and his buddy in, which will make sure your electric has no problem and shock the inspector because of the nice job. 
As a review, I should let them know that their painters need to improve they job. Nice people as well but can be better. Especially after I have Shahar and Roy, I feel they should be better to be called Treeium.
Thank you Treeium to help me finish my project and give me a lot of help on the small things that I planned to do myself in order to save money."
5,"Treeium is an outstanding company and I loved working with my project manager, Guy.  I live in NY and was doing a bathroom remodel in my San Diego condo long distance.  Guy's communication was excellent and he handled everything for me.  The workmanship was terrific - the bathroom is stunning.  And my sister who lives there said his crew was very polite, very neat, and very punctual.   I highly recommend Treeium, and would use them again in a heartbeat!"
5,"Treeium is an excellent, extremely professional company. They worked fast and efficiently, and created a beautiful new bathroom for us. The quality of the work is outstanding and the entire team of specialists  work together to do an outstanding job. We have now hired them to remodel our kitchen, a second bathroom, as well as other rooms in our home. We would like to thank our contractor Lior Lazarovich and his entire team for a job super well done! Thank you!"
5,"Awesome guy  and  Professional Individual. 
I wasn't aware about Knowledge and skills. Very confident in many areas and topics.  Easy and direct conversation within professional manner."
5,"Treeium has just completed our down-to-the-studs remodel of a 1977 guest bathroom.  Our initial contact was with Tomer Turjeman.  He was pleasant and informative on the telephone, arrived promptly and answered all our questions.  We then left town for two months.  When we recontacted Tomer, he arrived a couple days later and spent several hours helping us clarify how we wanted the remodeled bathroom to look.  He offered suggestions, gently guided us away from a few bad decisions, and offered resources.

Work began within the week.  We opted to select materials ourselves and were very pleased with the suppliers Tomer recommended.  He told us that if we had the materials on hand as needed (we managed to do so), it would take no more than 6 weeks, and that he would try for 4 weeks.  It actually took 18 days from start to finish. 

Each evening, Tomer texted us the plan for the next day.  Three Treeium crews did the work.  All of them arrived when stated, were careful of our possessions, were tidy as the day progressed, and cleaned up at the end of each day, which was generally mid-afternoon.  All 8 guys were pleasant, skillful, and efficient.

This was a relatively small project, but Tomer made us feel that we were his best & most important customer.  We are very pleased with the quality of the work and with our relationship with Tomer.

We found this a very positive experience and have couple more projects in mind with them."
5,"I recently had some major work done with Treeium and it came out great. We had very expensive sliding doors added to the back of our house after another contractor did a poor job. Then the recent rains caused some balcony damage. Gina and Greg were on the case a had a team resolve the problem for us. My home is in excess of $5,000,000 and I felt comfortable using Treeium."
5,"I'd like to thank the good people at Treeium, especially Gina and Greg and all the people at the Quality Assistance Department that help me out with my leaky roof. I had treeium come out two years ago to replace my whole roof, 2 years later we had a leak, even though we're out of warranty for the labor they came out and patch the roof for no charge. Gina was kind and courteous to help me with my problem, and stayed in contact with me till the issue was resolved. And Greg did everything he could to make things right. And stayed on top of things till the leak was fixed. I would recommend Treeium to anyone who needs any general construction done."
5,Amir Teymouri of Treeium is very professional and hard working.  He is doing a great job.  The work looks great.  Very efficient.
5,"I have had experience with one other ""5"" star company and all I can say is not all 5 star companies are the same on Home Advisor. Treeium is a true 5 star company-a class act, a family-like company. First it started with Liran who wrote in detail exactly what we would expect in remodeling our 1970's kitchen. As with some companies, we were not pressured. Next came Natalie, a first class interior designer who did a computer model of our new kitchen in detail. She brought samples of cabinet finishes, back splashes and paint to go with the countertops we had discussed with Liran. During demolition the crew discovered the outside kitchen wall was soaking wet. The wall board and insulation was removed and Liran was called. When our new shower was turned on, the water was running down the wall from a broken drain pipe that had been caused by another ""5"" star company when they replaced the upstairs shower and plumbing a few weeks before. I can't imagine what the damage would have been if we had waited the 3 years to remodel the kitchen as originally planned. Liran came right over to assess the situation and got the repairs done ASAP. The rest of the remodeling came together with no problems and the end result was exactly what we wanted. Unlike the other company who left as soon as the inspector signed the report, Treeium paid attention to the finishing details. All I had to do was text Liran with what I wanted done and it was taken care of; to fixing spots on the ceiling to moving a drawer in one of the cabinets, even the tiniest finishing details were taken care of. I would not hesitate to recommend Treeium and make our kitchen available for viewing by potential customers."
5,"I would like to express our gratitude of selecting Treeium as our contractor for our major remodel to our home in Laguna Beach, Ca.But, more than this, we were fortunate to have Farid Ghaheri as our general contractor. Farid's professionism, attention to details, knowledge of construction/local laws/vendors, communicating and just plain getting the job done, was superb.  Amir was excellent as well. Always available to us. 
Our Remodel was done in 3 months ! Right on Time.
We have recommend Treeium and Farid to any of the other villa owners who are planning on doing any type of remodel. And have communicated to our General Manager, to add Treeium to our community preferred contractor list. Thank You again
Steve & Diane"
5,"We've been working with Ilya Nodel and he is a gem!  We are doing an addition to our home and he is professional and friendly.  He has been patient and also reassuring during the planning stages.  He is always available to answer any questions we might have.  Everything he has told us has been accurate, we couldn't ask for better communication."
5,I hired Treeium to come out and do a bath remodel.  I ended up having them do all the flooring as well.  Guy Breuer was the Project Manager.  I liked that he always responded to my texts and questions promptly.  He met with my schedule.  Was friendly and cooperative with my needs.
5,"We are so pleased with our addition progress of a first floor master. Treeium and Guy have be outstanding. Guy has been an amazing communicator, patient, knowledgeable and caters to our needs. He has been there from the planning, to blueprints, to permits and now almost done with the build."
5,"We could not be happier with our bathroom remodel. Working with Maor (Mike) Tal, the Project Manager, was great. He was always responsive and answered every question we had. The Treeium construction crew was professional, considerate of our time and my family, and did high quality work. We have already talked to Mike about future projects and highly recommend him and his crew."
5,"I started out just getting quotes for refinishing kitchen cabinets, then it became a complete kitchen remodel . After interviewing 3 other companies I went with Treeium.  I connected with project managers Mike Tal, right from the start.  When you have strangers coming in and out of your home for 6 weeks you better like them and I did.  Every worker who came in was great.

  Thank you Mike :)"
4,"“Treeium” a good company

We recently had a bathroom remodel done in our 100 year home in Pasadena.  We went through a selection process of four potential contractors and although Treeium was not the lowest price, we liked their presentation best. We were very pleased with our decision.  Erez, the project manager, was excellent: responsive, easy to work with, and he listened to what we wanted. Treeium’s work teams, tiling (Juan) and plumbing (Marcello) in particular,  were exceptional. Also, all the work crews were very neat and cleaned the area throughly each day. The end result was a bathroom remodel better than we had hoped for and at the price we agreed to."
5,"Wow!!!!

If I am only allowed one word to describe our remodeling experience with Treeium, it would be “Wow”!! 

Disclaimer:  We are not the easiest clients to please; and we do our due diligence extensively.  My wife had prepared a page or 2 full of questions and interviewed 5-6 highly ranked/highly recommended contractors; and ranked them based on points on a spreadsheet.  Objectively, at the end of this process, Treeium came out on top.  Subjectively, we also chose Treeium, as two of the people we know had remodeled recently with Treeium and both recommended this firm.

Our project would be a pretty big project:  We want to update our kitchen and remove two load bearing walls to make our living room/dining room/kitchen into one big open space.  This meant opening   up the roof and put in two supporting beams.  Build an island in the kitchen area.  Switch the stove from one side of the kitchen to the other. Get new appliances and cabinets.  Seal off one of two fireplaces.  Build tiled deco wall where the chimney were.  Completely re-do a downstairs bathroom that has been very dilapidated.  Change a study room into a bedroom.  Wall off part of the family and make it into a storage room.   Move the entry door a few feet away to create a bigger laundry room.  Change an existing storage room into a study room.  Change the flooring on our master bedroom from carpet to tile.  Change the hard wood floor to tile for nearly the entire house.  Re pipe the old galvanized pipes to copper for water.  Re pipe the old gas pipes.  Termite treating the house.  Painting the exterior of the house and most of the interior.  Termite tenting of the whole house.  Building new wrought iron side gates and fences.  In short, 95% of our house is being remodeled.  

That being said, my review will rate Treeium based on Timing (delay), Cost, Quality, and Customer Service.

Timing:
Right from the get go, the project manager, Lior, came to our house and listened to what we wanted to do.  He suggested that we meet with his designer to go over what we want; and the designer came out with a design that really did accentuated everything we had wanted.  The permitting process followed the architectural and engineering studies, and everything went through without a hitch.  Within a few weeks after signing the contract, we were ready for the demolition process.  

At the beginning of this process, I had asked our project manager just how long this project would take.  He told me that this project should be done in 2 months.  I did not believe him when I first heard it; because I know delays are usually to be expected in any remodeling project.  Our previous remodeling done 10 years earlier with much smaller scope was completed in 4 months.  So I was skeptical when I heard that this would be done in 2 months.  The project ended up taking 2.5 months.  The extra 2 weeks were actually not Treeium’s fault; instead it was due the conditions of the house once they opened the walls, and some of the upgrades we wanted after the project had started.  So, I was quite amazed when the project ended up pretty much completed on time.  

So, wow!!

Cost:
Treeium is not the low cost leader out of the many contractors we had interviewed.  Treeium is not the most expensive either.  Its quote falls on par with most of the quotes within a few percentage points.  At the end, we did not pick Treeium because of its price quote; but purely based on how well it scored on our own ratings mentioned above, and how highly recommended they were by their former clients.

Quality of the workmanship:
Wow!!  I don’t exactly know much about construction, so obviously I can’t tell whether whatever Treeium did behind the walls (plumbing, wiring, framing) were great in quality.  I can, however, tell that the finished product, with the entertainment cabinets, the kitchen cabinets, the island, the flooring, painting, and many more, are very much high quality, with definite attention to details. The hardwares used are also top notch.  

In my previous remodeling projects, we had custom ordered cabinets from Home Depot.  These cabinets from Treeium are exponentially better, with soft closing on all of the doors.   

The scope had included installation of recessed ceiling lights for several areas.  Treeium did above and beyond that, and replaced some of my older recessed lights to LED recessed lights.  

In previous projects, the contractors were capable in doing exactly what they needed to do.  Treeium not only did what was in the scope; on many occasions, Treeium went above and beyond what were in the scope.  And, again, everything Treeium did was done well.

Customer Service:

So far, as you may tell, I am truly impressed with Treeium.  But, what really earned my “wow” review, is Treeium’s approach to customer service.  Right after the contracts are signed, Lior, the project manager starts to provide almost daily updates of where Treeium is in the process and what we need to do to get prepared (such as packing and moving out).  Once the project got started with the demolition, the project manager would keep us apprised of everything that’s going on in the house that day, and provide us with a “progress report” and what to expect next.  So, we were kept in the loop every step of the way.  

In addition, obviously with a project this size, some hiccups are to be expected, such as damages caused by the demolition/remodeling.  Those are unavoidable.  Another reason Treeium and Lior earned the “wow” from me is how quickly they respond to our concerns and how well they addressed those concerns.  At the end of the project, we had prepared a punch list of all the items that needed to be fixed due to damages from this remodeling.  Within a matter of days, they were able to fix everything on the punch list, often times to better conditions than they were before this remodeling project.  No delays, no excuses, just get them done.

Wow!!

We have moved back home for 5 days now; and every moment I am here, I look around and remember the way it was before this project, I can’t help but be amazed how quickly this whole project come together; and how satisfied I am with the final result.  

So, wow!!!  Kudos to Treeium and Kudos to Lior, our project manager; and thank you for a surprisingly pleasant experience."
5,"I had been wanting to fix my wooden floor which had been rotting away for the last 7 years due to moisture.  So I was googling home improvement companies, and had 2 companies to come n look at the rotting floor to see what they would say, how they would go about figuring out the cause of the moisture, etc. None of the sales people impressed me enough so I didn't bother to get an estimate for cost. Instead I googled for more companies n saw Treeium. Their website n reviews sounded good enough so I had Treeium send me a salesman. It turned out they actually dispatch project managers with experience: Amir and Farid.
They explained to me a thorough work process/procedure they would implement if I were to hire them  which seemed reasonable n professional. Also, it sounded very convenient for me because they had all different kinds of workers/professionals who could diagnose n fix my floor. 
A long story short, I ended up hiring them n had them not only fix my floors but some electrical lines that had been giving us headaches as well. It took over 3 weeks yet I'm glad I had Amir n Farid take care of my house project. They were prompt n quick to understand the work situation n most of all, they knew how to be sensitive to even the smallest concerns I had. No other companies I had worked with previously on other projects was able to meet such standard. (I'm not an easy person to work with/for) 
Also, I really appreciated how they came to inspect the work morning n evening daily. And I was actually impressed that they brought a portable toilet stand for the workers to use. 
Overall, I am fully satisfied with Treeium n the 2 project managers: Amir and Farid. I highly recommend this company."
5,Treeium did top quality work on our master bathroom remodel.  Even the smallest detail that we weren't satisfied with got resolved.  Amir and Farid listened to what we had in mind and offered design suggestions/options that made our bathroom turn out beautiful.  Tile shower and floor turned out great.  We love the new vanity they suggested.  A very high quality job.
5,Jesse Marquez was very helpful in my initial phone call for estimate appt. he seemed very knowledgeable kind and eager to help.
5,"Took longer than expected (4 months), partly due to several inspections that changed the rules several times. In the end Erez, our Project Manager, completed the job as promised. Thank you Treeium."
5,"Our experience with Avi Shushan has been excellent, He kept us informed in every step of the process,
Avi is very responsive and knowledgeable 
He is the most extreme personable and he made us feel very easy with everything.
We will defiantly recommend him to everyone we know."
5,"There are no words to describe the devotion and attention that we have received from Farid Ghaheri, the project manager, and his crew in the remodeling of our house.  Farid is always available and unceasingly polite, attentive and willing to offer suggestions (that are always well thought out).  His crew does superior work and we especially appreciated the work of Robert, one of the foremen, and Carlos, one of the workers.  The work was done promptly and on budget.  There were no surprises and everything was up front.  If you need any work done, hire this company and ask for Farid !"
5,"Farid Ghaheri is our project manager and I couldn't be more satisfied. He is a no pressure very easy personality. He and his crew are very respectful of my home, my dog and my family. They are there when he says they will be and finish projects on time!!! He is patient with me when I make changes. He is totaly unflappable. I have been very happy with the workmanship of the individual componants that make up my new master bath."
5,"I've hired Treeium in the past and this is my 2nd 5-star review for them, I granted the 5 stars chiefly because of our Project Manager Avihen Levanon who efficiently coordinated the difficult task of a complete remodel of my 120-year-old kitchen. The entire kitchen except for the framework was demolished from the ceiling to the floor, including an outside structure attached to the house which had covered up 2 of the original kitchen windows. The kitchen required a lot of electrical upgrading and I appreciate that Treeium adheres to the strict building codes and my kitchen is in full compliance with the city I live in. Another plus for Treeium are the different choices and fine quality of the cabinets, countertops, and flooring I was given to choose from. My kitchen was built to my wishes, I love it and what a delight having the windows restored. Also, it was completed in the time frame stated."
5,"Update - We could not be happier with our new kitchen and the experience working with Treeium.  Everyone at Treeium was extremely professional every step of the way.  Those working on site and those in the office.  Great craftsmanship, excellent communication, punctuality, attention to detail & commitment to our satisfaction.  (We were picky and asked them to tend to small details we felt weren't exactly right and they came right away and said they were committed to making us happy.)  We have worked with other companies during remodels and the experience has NOT always been positive like this.  We highly recommend!  Thank you, Treeium!


We are in the middle of a kitchen & bathroom remodel with Treeium right now and so far we couldn’t be happier.  

Our Project Manager, Guy Borenstein, made us feel like we are all part of the same passionate team on this remodel from the time we first met up until now.  GHe is responsive, makes himself available when we have questions or concerns.  He’s been willing to take the time to walk us through all the steps of our project, (even if he’s already explained it previously) and he checks in to make sure we’re happy each step of the way.  

The first plans we had for our kitchen turned out to be out of our budget, not just with Treeium but with every company we got a bid from.  Guy was able to work with us to suggest ways to cut down the budget and we arrived at a new plan that we are still extremely happy with and with a price we can afford.  

We were told by friends, family, and even by Guy that going into a remodel can feel like your entire home has been turned into a dirty construction site, but we have been very surprised and impressed to find that Treeium is very clean and professional throughout the entire process so far.  They have used floor protection and sectioned off areas of our home from floor to ceiling while they are working, which has kept nearly all of the dust out of the other rooms, then what has surprised us the most, is that when they leave in the afternoon, they remove all plastic and floor protection so we feel completely at home (and clean) until the next morning when they lay down all the floor protection, and section off areas with plastic again - We feel it really shows that they’re going the extra mile so we don’t feel like we’re living in a construction zone.  

All the actual work completed so far has been extremely high quality, on time, and on budget. Everyone working in our home are polite and professional.  Everyone has been willing to explain to us exactly what they are doing, why, how long it will take, etc.  

When the crew demo’d our old kitchen we found some issues in the walls that needed addressing.  (not treeium’s fault).  Treeium was able to rework the schedule to accommodate the new steps required to address those issues.  

So far we’ve only had a single pice of wood that was cracked in the process of the remodel.  They immediately offered to replace it.  


So far 5 star rating for sure!"
1,"This remodel was the WORST experience ever.  We have a very large bathroom and we were quoted $50K and told that it would take 8 weeks but it took over 8 mths.  At the beginning of this project we felt so much pressure to buy a long list of things they needed so that the project wasn’t delayed.  How were we suppose to do that when all we had was a layout and no measurements? Some of the delay with this project was due to the city inspector but ultimately their contractors were fixing errors or redoing things that weren’t done right.  The first thing we were told is that a portion of a load bearing wall would need to be moved.  They sent me the change order and said that it would cost $7,000.  The first thing I asked is what is the $7,000 for?  I was told not to worry that I’d receive a detailed receipt.  What they sent me was vague and didn’t detail anything.  I never should’ve signed that change order without the detailed breakdown in my hands first.  So they used Simpson Strong-Tie hardware which is great but we told them that my husband and I work for Simpson and that we could provide the hardware that was needed.  They claim they were never told this.  I complained and was told that Treeium didn’t buy any product from Simpson.  This might be true if they already had the parts they needed but that doesn’t mean that those costs didn’t trickle down to us.  Another thing that was added to the change order was replacement of the subfloor in the shower.  We had already done the demo for the shower and it was clear when they saw the project that the subfloor would need to be replaced so to add this to the change order is ridiculous.  They replaced clear block tile with a window in the shower but the window was too big thus half of it was in the shower and half out.  They replaced the window but unfortunately the finish didn’t match the other large window that they installed over the tub so they had to replace it yet again.  We noticed the supply line for the toilet was about 10” away from the toilet so it was an eye sore.  I asked them about it and they said, “That is what the inspector advised us to do and we can’t change it.”   I called the inspector the next day and he said, “I don’t have a change order but I have no problem if you want it moved.”   One concern before even starting the project was whether the exterior stucco/paint would match where they put in the windows.  They told us that they paint the whole wall so there’s no worry about a paint match.  Well because that wasn’t written in the contract they claim that they never told us that.  The tub grout started to fail within the first week and we ended up with 6 extra boxes of floor tile.  They did credit our bill for the extra floor tile.  When I tried to use the tub the first time there was a problem with the water pressure.  They ultimately fixed that but when I tried to use the shower the first time there was no cold water so it was scalding hot.  Apparently there was a part in the valve that was broken or that they broke.  A replacement part was bought and they still couldn’t get it to work.  The 2nd Project Mgr (I was told the first one no longer worked there) called me and told me it wasn’t working and asked if he could go buy another shower valve similar to the one we bought.  I said, “That is fine but we won’t accept a cheap replacement”.  He assured me it would be good quality.  I got home to find that they had to remove two of the tiles from the shower (which I knew nothing about) but the part they bought was a cheap $100 replacement and what we bought was almost $300 so we were not happy.  They installed the plumbing for the vanity before the vanity even arrived which meant that the installation was difficult.  According to the contractors doing the work they told us, “You guys bought the wrong size vanity”.”  No one ever told us what size vanity to buy.  The problem was that they put the plumbing in before they even knew what we purchased.  They cut sloppy holes in the shelves of the vanity to accommodate the plumbing and have since fixed this by making new shelves but I’ve lost most of my space on the bottom shelf.  The silicone they put around the toilet came off after about 7-10 days and they grouted around the tub when that should’ve really been silicone.  They ultimately did install silicone around the tub but they also put it in the shower.  We never asked for silicone in the shower and it looks sloppy.  They also countersunk the tub and that wasn’t how it was designed to be installed.  We had an existing pocket door that just needed a new latch on it which they installed but now it’s off track and scratching the paint on both sides.  The only thing they are good at is reminding customers that a payment is due. I would not recommend Treeium to my worst enemy!"
5,"We found Treeium through Houzz. Salesman and Project Manager Avi Shushan was at our house a couple of days later, where he helped us put our remodel ideas together. This was our first remodel, and we were not sure what to expect. We had heard that contractors worked sporadically - but the Treeium experience was continuous. Avi always gave us a heads up on the schedule.  We had pleasant, skilled crews working on our home every day for a month. Avi also has a helpful designer's eye if you are doing your own design work and need a nudge. The stamped concrete guys are artists, as are the tile and paint guys. The results are gorgeous."
5,Guy gave us a bid we could live with.  The contract was clear and through the whole project was exactly as the contract stated.  Payments were easy to make online.  Guy was easy to work with and listened.  The work was done on time.  Antonio cleaned up every night.  Could not be happier with my new kitchen.  Best construction experience ever.
5,"Thank you Lior Lazarovich for a very professional job well done. 
  Lior was always available to us too answer all our requests and questions . Great job Lior, we wish you the best."
5,"Treeium and my project manager, Guy Breuer, really delivered on my bathroom remodel.  They were the 3rd quote I received and I found the fairest of all.  The project came in within scope, on time (actually a little ahead of schedule) and on budget.  Don't forget to include them in your project plan!!"
5,"We met with Erez to discuss our bathroom remodel project. He was very personable, knowledgeable and professional. After interviewing other companies we decided to go with Treeium and were very glad we did.
Erez and his crew did a great job. The bathroom looks awesome. The work was completed on time and the workmanship was top notch.
Would definitely recommend to our family and friends."
5,"Farid is spectacular.
He exceeded my expectations!
He is professional, artistic, punctual, dependable, timely and realistic.
He treats small projects with same respect and professionalism as a big project.
I know because we started off a tiny project but expanded it and are still so very thrilled.
I highly recommend him!! We are already planning phase 2!!!"
5,"We're in the process of doing a room addition to our new house, and recently signed with Treeium. Farid Ghaheri is managing the project and we can't praise him highly enough. From the very first meeting, he's been professional, articulate, and punctual -- most of the time he's early (very important to us, with our tight schedules!). Farid walked us through the entire process and timeline, and was always honest and realistic with his recommendations and estimates. Treeium in general has been wonderful to work with for several reasons: 1) their user-friendly and transparent online portal; 2) set cost; 3) versatility with adding to the scope of work; 4) their economy of scale, with several crews and professionals available to do whatever needs to be done, when it needs to be done. We discussed budget with Farid very early on, and by the time we got to the contract and detailed scope of work, the price he gave us was right in the initial range he quoted us. One of the best things about how Farid works is that he always has examples of recent or ongoing projects to illustrate his ideas; he's a wizard with his iPhone and laptop. Farid is extremely responsive to texts, emails, and calls, and always impresses us with how frequently he's available to swing by our home to discuss an idea or to check on someone's work. You're in good hands with Treeium, and especially with Farid."
5,Thank you for the initial information on how you work.  The video is also helpful. I look forward to getting a proposal.
5,"So far the kitchen is looking good.Daniel is very positive, friendly, and personable. We would recommend Treeium to others, they have a great quality assurance representative Darrell."
5,"Spoke with Nina who was very helpful and professional in answering a few of my questions and making me feel that working with Treeium could be a good fit for us. 
I look forward to our initial appointment next week to find out more. Thank you Nina"
5,Lisa was very pleasant to speak to. She was my first exposure to Treeium and gave me enough confidence in the company that I setup the initial appointment.
4,"Treeium and Itay, the Project Manager, were very good.  They came on time, fallowed all of my directions, came back promptly if I thought something else needed to be done, and completed the project within a decent period of time.  I would recommend them for bathroom remodels.  The cost was reasonable for the job done."
5,"We needed to remodel our 2 bedroom condo in Culver City and needed it done quickly because we were paying for two mortgages at the same time. Erez Shifferman came and after chatting for a few minutes with my wife and me he immediately understood our ideas and concerns and provided many helpful suggestions on how to save time and money with our project. Not only is he knowledgeable about all aspects of remodeling, but is also honest and upfront with all the costs. Some contractors might give you a low estimate at the beginning and surprise you with extra charges down the road, but this is never the case with Erez and Treeium because they are such a reputable and old company and they have an ironclad reputation to defend!"
5,"Amazing company to work with.
The crew is honest, reliable and professional.

The are prompt and always available if you need them.

I highly recommend Treeium."
5,"the workmanship is excellent.  all of the men were on the job on time, finished job in a timely manner--as promised.  house looks great.  so good i have just hired treeium to do another job for me, bigger than first.  i trust them to care for my home as i do.  farid, the project manager has integrity.  he looks out for me and my home as if it were his own.  he arrives for appointments when he says he will.  i couldn't be happier with the whole experience. i will use them again and again.  thank you, treeium team."
5,"I ordered a 308sqft aluminum patio cover to reduce the sun exposure on my back bedroom. Not only does the cover look great, but how things progressed was impressive. 
1. I was given an up front price that was in line with competitors. I chose them due to other good reviews they have had.
2. The project was timed and well managed by Erez, who coordinated the permit, the materials purchase and the installation. 
3. The installation passed inspection the first time and was well done. Built per plan. 

Overall this was was a very pleasant and efficient engagement of an impeccable business. I highly recommend Treeium."
5,"We just started working with Treeium in the preliminary phase and so far so good! They are extremely professional and timely. My husband and I just started the process, and, in the meantime, we won a $200 Amazon gift card by completing a survey for them! We were so excited! Adriana Villasenor and Don Mkhitarian hand delivered the gift card to our home and were super sweet and helpful. It’s safe to say we are looking forward to working with them and our project manager Don Mkhitarian!"
5,"Sam Deen and his crew did an excellent job in remodeling our master bathroom.  Everyone was very courteous, on time, cleaned the site daily and respected our work days and hours.  They made my dream bathroom come true."
5,"We recently had a bathroom remodel done by Treeium and were very happy with their work and especially with our project manager, Farid.  Their workers showed up on time, worked diligently on the project, and cleaned up each day when they were done.  Farid was on site every day to make certain the work was progressing, and he was also a huge help with the design details and in making sure everything was done to our liking.  The job was completed professionally and on time and looks great!  We would definitely give 5 stars to Farid and Treeium."
5,"Always a scary proposition trusting in a construction/remodeling company, but we really lucked out with Treeium. Initially contacted by Guy Breuer, who was to be the project manager on our master bath remodel. He gave us a quote that was far less than 2 other contractors and promised the work would be completed in 4 weeks. He lied. It was done in just under 3 weeks!! 
Guy was very helpful in recommending tile and bathroom fixture companies in the area and we found exactly what we were looking for (thanks Russ at Modello Tile). What I really think made all the difference was the crew that we had for our project. Shout out to Miguel, Liverado and the rest of Juan's crew, true craftsmen. Clean, efficient and showed up every day until completion.
Truly an amazing and easy experience. I strongly suggest at least making Treeium one of your quotes."
5,"Ashley was very professional, reviewing my remodeling needs and scheduling a project estimator to meet with me.  Selection will be based on proposal."
5,"The Irvine team, headed by Farid are so professional. I appreciate all the workers from the demo team to the tile men to the plumbers. They are polite, personable, receptive to questions and input, clean up when they are done and very good at what they do. You will not regret hiring this team. Kara"
5,Tomer is remarkably reliable and responsive.  He conducted himself and subcontractors in an effiicent and professional manner.   We will be using Treeium and Tomer again soon.
5,"After interviewing several contractors, for a kitchen remodel, we awarded the contract to Treeium, and I am glad we did.

From the onset, they were professional, clean, neat, reliable, and the end result is an amazing kitchen that we love.

Our Project manager was Assaf Labi.  He and his team of experts came in measured drew and gave us a quote.  From start to finish Assaf coordinated everything.  We talked to him on a daily basis.  He texted to make sure all was clean when the crew left for the evening.

I was amazed that even during the demolition phase, there was no dust in adjoining rooms.  They had the place sealed tight.

The quality of our cabinets is outstanding and the workmanship for installation if perfect. Their designer came up with different ideas.  We kept making changes until we were happy.  She knew her stuff.

I highly recommend Treeium for any remodel you want to do.  They are a reliable company.  With all the nightmares you hear about contractors, we did not experience any problems."
5,"I first met Guy Borenstein and then he became like a brother figure.  He came, inspected, gave an estimate, brought the crew, and did the job on time and as per their estimate.  I definitely recommend him and Treeium for any renovation or upgrade you need around your house."
5,"When I decided to remodel/enlarge my bathroom and build new closets, I wasn't sure I'd find someone who can build exactly what I wanted, especially since we had to deal with HOA rules and CCRs 
Erez Schifferman ruled over the job and dealt with all the hiccups that always happen when remodeling and construction is done, in a very professional and friendly way. I'm not sure I would've survived this without him being on top of all of it. Oh and I'm quite surprised that he survived my complaining during the last 3 months"
5,"I’m so over joyed with the experience we have had with Erez Schifferman!  He hasn’t represented this company with outstanding professionalism, patience, and motivation.  We had a terrible experience with a different company so we were very nervous about dealing with contractors once again but Erez has made sure that all our questions have been answered and had reassured through the project!  We’re almost done with our project and are overly pleased!"
5,We had our front and backyard re landscaped with drought tolerant plants and materials. Erez Shifferman was responsive to every request we had to make our yard perfect. When there were questions /problems ( as there are with all construction projects ) Erez was available immediately  and addressed every one in a timely and in a more than satisfactory manner. I would recommend Erez Shifferman and Treeium for any and all of your home remodel needs.
5,"We hired Treeium to remodel our master bathroom. Guy Borenstein was very easy to work with and followed through with us every step of the way. The crews were professional, did good work were friendly and always cleaned up after each job. Our remodel was done in a timely manner and we are very pleased."
5,"So far Treeium and our head contractor, Guy Borenstein, have done an amazing job on our open concept kitchen remodel. And we are not easy customers! We had load bearing walls removed, beams placed within the ceiling, concrete footings poured under the house, our hardwood floors seamlessly matched to run from the living room into the kitchen, drywall on the walls and ceiling is perfectly flat, and all has gone smoothly. Meanwhile we are still living in the house so they sealed off the rest of the house with zipper entry doorways, and the dreaded dust that we were so afraid of has been kept to a minimum. They are even sticking to their budget and timeline. I’ve been warned these days that is not to be expected! We should know because we have experienced the worst with other contractors.  So I feel the need to shout off the mountain tops how awesome these guys are. We can’t wait to see the finished product!"
5,"We just had our house remodel completed by Treeium and we couldn’t be happier.  We started with the kitchen demolition which honestly made my wife cry.  But the kitchen that was built in its place is like a dream come true.  Our Project Manager, Lior Lazarovich took our old tired kitchen and gave us a new house.  I can’t believe this is the same house we lived in for 7 years.  I’m truly blown away by the quality of their work.  5 Stars all the way.  Thanks again Lior Lazarovich and Treeium."
5,"One of the greatest experiences I has while remodeling my home. Great company, great customer service and workmanship. I was very impressed by the professionalism of my project manager, he managed my project which was a gate replacement and a kitchen remodel in a very timely matter. I'm very happy with my decision and would highly recommend this company to my friends."
5,"There were some problems and delays.  However, they promised to complete all punch list items by December 11, 2017.  It is extremely satisfying to receive clear commitments from Treeium!"
4,"I don't think any contractor is perfect and deserves 5 stars since there is always room for improvement.  But, we are very happy with Treeium's work and the results of our project.

We completed our house remodel with Treeium in April 2017.  It was an extensive project requiring us to move out of the house for 8 months.  We added a bathroom, shifted the location of our kitchen, completely rebuilt an old addition with new vaulted ceilings, upgraded all the electrical, new HVAC, and tankless water heater.

We found Treeium on Home Advisor and selected them for these reasons:
1.  They are a local company, which made communication/meetings very easy.
2.  We liked the idea that they did not sub out their workers.  The same foreman, Mika, and his crew of 5-6 guys were here throughout the entire project, with additional specialty contractors such as electrical, tile layer, HVAC installer.
3.  The salesperson, Guy Borenstein, was very good-natured and we thought he would be an easy person to work with.  Turned out to be true.
4.  They could also take care of the engineering plans and we would not have to hire a separate engineer/architect.
5.  They state that the customer will not incur additional costs above the initial bid for contractor mistakes or misjudgments.  This was absolutely true.

While I don’t think that any construction projects are perfect and without stress, we were generally pleased with Treeium for their work ethic and attention to customer expectation.  They were very efficient during the work schedule and we were consistently updated with the progress.  Any mistakes/errors (which are inevitable) were quickly taken care of.  We are truly enjoying our newly remodeled home and have referred Treeium to several of our friends interested in remodeling their homes.

Our biggest complaints would be the following: (1) they were sometimes insensitive to our schedules (asking us to immediately run out and purchase items needed for the house); (2) the communication between various workers/crew was sometimes lacking; (3) more time and attention could have been paid to drywall finishing; and, (4) the crew could have done a better job maintaining our existing landscape (we are still digging concrete pieces and construction debris out of our lawns).  Fairly small issues considering the scope of our project.

Overall, I would recommend Treeium for your house project.  Compared to the nightmare stories I have heard about other contractors, Treeium is a reliable company and genuinely tries their best for the customer."
5,"FANTASTIC AND FOLLOW UP!  I highly recommend Treeium.
We used Treeium to renovate our kitchen.  I got bids from 6 different companies and Treeium was neither the least nor the most expensive.  But, Ron was able to show photos of previous work and also seemed the most sincere.  We needed to have the kitchen finished in 5 weeks as we wanted it done before we moved into the house.  Ron and his team finished the job on time and within the budget.  
They've come over several times to make the smallest of adjustments for me.  As a matter of fact, 4 months after the job, the kitchen faucet was loose and Ron sent someone to fix it and at no charge.
We plan on renovating our baths soon and Ron and Treeium will be the first team we call."
5,"We had an entire house remodeled and worked with PG Mr Ron Amondy and Mr Allan Nagar. They and their crews were professional, punctual and responsible the whole time. The quote was also closed to the actual cost at the end. We were happy  and satisfied with their service and will highly recommend them to anyone who need a remodel service."
5,"Assaf was my project manager. He did an outstanding job. My kitchen and bathroom were totally gutted and remodeled. He is experienced, knowledgeable, supportive, and well organized. He kept constant communication with me throughout the construction process which I appreciated. Assaf provided me with guidance when it was time to choose appliances, sinks, flooring, countertops, etc. 

I have a high end kitchen now that functions to meet my needs. My bathroom looks elegant. What a difference!
Yvonne"
5,"We had a master bathroom redone. Eli was tremendous as both a person and as a project manager. The work was all excellent and the process smooth. All details were thoroughly discussed and changes requested along the way were accommodated graciously.
All of the workers were pleasant and courteous. Definitely a recommendation from us!"
5,"Yay! I’m finally done with my project and I want to extend my sincere gratitude to Erez Shifferman & Treeium. Erez, you brought trust back to my realm of working with contractors, thank you so much for everything you’ve done for me! I interviewed Erez as a part of cautiously trying to commit to executing a general remodel that I was thinking of for a long time, and I immediately connected with him. I knew right then and there that I would work well with him because you definitely want to feel comfortable and communicate well with the person who is going to be in charge of your once in a life time remodeling project. In my opinion, this is true to any scale project, not necessarily an involved and longer one. 
Erez was able to show me his company profile, all of their contractors licenses and paperwork. This put my mind at ease and I decided to go with Treeium. Now, when the project is completed , I’m happy to say that the quality of the workmanship and attention to detail blow me away. I am very pleased with all of the work done. Erez was always available by text or phone call, and he spent a lot of time helping me make decisions and going over options. I never felt rushed or that my needs were not met.
The entire process went smoothly despite the fact that my daughter and I lived in the home the entire time. I even have two inside dogs and they always made sure to keep their water bowl full and put them outside and clean up when needed. Every room was transformed beautifully. It looks like a new home! Actually, the project took longer than expected because I ended up adding more and more to the original scope of work after I saw how smooth, worry free and well handled the process has been. I figured I might as well get it all done and finish my dream list. Communication was key for me throughout the process, and Erez masters that very well, regardless to what time the clock reads. Bottom line, I was very well served with nothing but professionalism, great quality of workmanship, communication  and honesty. Thank you again Erez & Treeium for a very well done job! I highly recommend Treeium and Erez for your home and all of your contracting needs. You won’t be disappointed!"
5,Treeium demolished our combination bathtub/shower in order to install a walk-in shower with a sliding door to accommodate my 84-year-old father who moved in with us. The shower is aesthetically very attractive and works well to meet my Dad's needs. The workmen were courteous and the project manager Erez was on top of the project and communicated well with us every step of the way.
5,"Treeium remodeled our kitchen and it came out beautifully. We found Treeium through Home Advisor. I wanted to remodel the old kitchen we had because I continuously kept getting splinters. So we remodeled with Treeium and our kitchen is simply amazing. Very impressed with the precision of the cabs & countertops. They made sure everything is sealed. If Treeium would make a mistake, they graciously corrected the concern. Very professional, hard working company. Communication could have been better between labor workers. Overall the experience was great. Benjamin was the best project manager. He kept in touch with us, and addressed all of our concerns. Very punctual and communication with him was great. I definitely will consider working with Benjamin & Treeium again!"
5,"One word:   Excellent.  The renovation was completed with ease AND ahead of schedule.  The cost was relative to the renovation.  The project manager, Liran Avital, was extremely valuable.  He was at my disposal at any hour including, but not limited to 11:30 p.m., when I could respond to various forms of communication.  Mr. Avital took very good care of my investment.  His foreman, Caesar, and his crew were extremely tidy, diligent, meticulous and patient in every aspect of the renovation.  If Caesar had a question about the design, he asked and fully understood sometimes vague instructions.  The designer, Natalie, did a fabulous job on suggesting the appropriate backsplash, cabinetry and appropriate handles.  The kitchen cabinets are self-closing with a spice rack and lazy Susan contained therein.  Treeium was an excellent choice."
5,"Treeium provided us with excellent, tasteful kitchen and bathroom remodelIng within our budget.  Our condo is now stylish and ready for rental!  Prior to contacting Treeium, we had gone through the estimation process with two big box companies, which we decided not to use because of their ""out-of-a can"" offerings and dishonest estimation practices.  From telephone reception to oversight to the finishing touches, Treeium was professional, expeditious and friendly in their dealings.  Project Manager Guy Breuer warmly walked us through the entire process, explaining what sorts of things might be discovered that would affect the scope of work, and therefore cost.  He and his team of excellent contractors not only carried out the work, but also made important aesthetic suggestions based on their experience.  We are very happy we went with them and would not hesitate to contact Treeium again for any remodeling work!"
5,My experience with Treeium was great. My project manager was Lior Lazarovich and he was great . I will most likely choose Treeium for future renovations. I have no complaints for Lior. He did an amazing job assisting my needs and addressed all my concerns.
4,My name is Ben. I had my sons fiancé's kitchen remodeled and I have to say everything went ok. I had to leave town for a weekend and project manager Lior was amazing at managing their renovation. I had left specific instructions to install a delicate vintage style stove to their kitchen as a wedding gift. Everything went great! And they're very happy and satisfied with the remodel.
5,"Treeium and Erez Shifferman our project manager were amazing! We’ve suffered through way too many hot summers in our own home until we just couldn’t take it anymore. We met with several companies in the process of trying to wrap our heads around costs and different solutions for our needs. Erez stood out from the crowd right from the get-go with professionalism, communication, honesty and overall good vibe. We were very impressed with his expertise, knowledge and how he carried himself overall. Erez kept in touch with us after our initial meeting and made us feel very comfortable towards the next meeting we lined up with him to go over specifics of the project and get everything going. Erez delivered everything he promised and I simply can’t believe how smooth our project was handled considering all the elements of the project, which included removal of a giant 50ft tall tree, re-insulating our attic including 2 attic exhaust fans, re-painting our entire house, installing brand new AC units in all the bedrooms and the cherry on the icing - 3,500sf of beautiful energy efficient drought tolerant landscaping that completely transformed our front and back yards from desert like no man’s land to beautifully designed yards we’re now proud of! We want to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to Erez, we’re truly blown away by the service and attention we received from him, we simply can’t imagine the process being any smoother or worries free than what it was. Now that the project is completed, we’re happy to contribute our review to the list of reviews Erez is so proud of, we now know he works very hard towards making his customers happy and satisfied so the least we can do is share our story with others - if you’re reading this review and thinking to work with Treeium, do yourself a favor and ask to meet with Erez, he’s a needle in a haystack!"
5,"We remodeled a second bathroom.  Complete gut job, changing bathtub to shower removing a soffit.  The project manager was Lior, who was excellent at communicating with us as the project progressed.  We are very happy with the result!"
5,"Erez Shifferman was our project coordinator. We moved out of state while the work was being done. Erez was great and very easy to work with remotely - he kept in touch regularly, also often sending photos of progress. He handled purchasing of items, so that we didn't have to worry about that. He gave us confidence that Treeium was doing good work while we were many miles away, and made it a stress-free experience for us.

After the work was done, we made a quick trip back to see it in-person. We were very satisfied with the overall quality of work by Treeium."
5,"When great work is combined with exceptional service the results is always fun.

The project is almost completed. A few minor changes need to be done; However Treeium did an excellent job. Took their time to bring the most out of the work and made adjustments as 

Based on the overall craftsmanship and the quality of each character, Gustavo (cab installer) Roy (electrician), Jaime (the painter) and Phillip (the tile man) need a raise. 

It is a pleasant home owner experience. Strongly recommend Treeium to do your remodel. They stand as a professional contractor because it is critical for increasing the value of your home. The RIGHT way

Have a great day.

Victor Lesley"
5,"The last thing that you want to be told when you move into your new home is that you have mold and that they will need to test, isolate, rip out, and reconstruct the affected area. When that reality set in within a week or so after we had moved in, we were heartbroken. While it hurt, we knew that we needed to take care of the issue immediately. When we hired Treeium to perform the work, we were very impressed by Farid’s knowledge and experience. His explanation of the situation and what steps were needed to remediate were thorough and complete. Farid maintained proper communication throughout the entire project and the Treeium staff who performed the work were incredibly professional and skilled. We thank Treeium for making our home safe and healthy."
5,"I had Treeium remove my old HVAC and replace it with a new one. My project manager was Tomer Turjeman. He was truly fantastic to work with. He was very helpful in helping decide on the best approach for the install and was very diligent in following up with the details. On top of that, he was a great conversationalist and was very respectful and friendly with my mother (who is staying with me for a bit). She was at the house during the project and really enjoyed talking with Tomer. She commented many times on how great Tomer and the rest of the Treeium team were. Tomer is the primary reason for my 5-star rating.

The work was completed with high quality and the new HVAC works very well. This is the first summer at the house where we were able to keep it consistently cool. We're very pleased with it. My only point of critical feedback is that Treeium is on the higher end pricing-wise and I would have liked to see a more transparent breakdown of the job costs.  I did not decrease my rating for this, however, because it was ultimately my decision to move forward and the job came in exactly at the agreed upon cost.

Excellent work, Tomer and team! We're very pleased."
5,"I had the pleasure of dealing with Guy Borenstein in working on a
proposal that fit my budget and he did everything he possibly could to meet that criteria and I was satisfied with the final proposal. He is so honest and real and I truly appreciated that. Unfortunately for Treeium, I decided to sell my condo ""as is."" I love trees and I love the fact the Treeium plants a tree at the completion of each renovation. Wish I could have been part of that. I highly recommend Guy Borenstein in particular at Treeium and their spectacular work (as you'll see on their website). I could not have had a more pleasant experience."
5,"After several difficult attempts with other contractors for our kitchen remodel, we finally landed on Treeium, and the fantastic Project Manager Oshrat. She was very attentive, honest, and responsive. She addressed every question or concern I had along the way and completed to job in a timely manner. The project was only a partial kitchen remodel (new quartz counters, marble backsplash, new sink and faucet), but we were always treated us like a big-ticket customer. We went into the project with a firm budget and only had one surprise with some electrical work that needed to be done. Oshrat was always mindful of our budget and even with the extra expense we still ended up under budget. Allen and Marvin did a lot of the work for our project and did a great job. I tend to be a perfectionist and notice all the little things. Every time I pointed something out they were always quick to fix it. Even a few weeks after the project was completed, I found a few small things that were not to my liking. I texted Oshrat, and she was ontop of it and said they would fix anything that was not to my liking. I would recommend Treeium in a heartbeat!!"
5,"I have partnered with Treeium to acquire more clients with larger design projects. 
The team is very innovative, creative and thorough and I look forward to working with  them for their professionalism and follow up."
5,"Erez is the best! If you’re thinking to hire Treeium for your home remodeling project and you were lucky enough to meet with Erez, let me save you some reading time - all the other reviews Erez has online are 100% accurate and truly describe this fine young man. Now, when the project is completed, I am very pleased to add my own review! We hired Treeium and Erez to replace our roof after meeting with a few companies, but not feeling as comfortable with them both on the personal and professional side. Since we had a bad experience with a different contractor in the past, we were very picky and selective this time around.. Erez took his time with ease when he met with us (twice!) and explained everything thoroughly. After we awarded Erez the project, first thing he said to me was “now it’s time for me to start proving myself to you”, and this is exactly what Erez has done throughout the project. We passed all inspections on the first shot and now we can comfortably leave for our vacation as we were able to meet a very tight schedule for completing our project. Thank you Erez so much for delivering everything you promised and as well for a well done job!"
5,"I would highly recommend working with Guy Breuer from Treeium, Inc for any of your future home improvement projects. My wife and I had the pleasure of his help and services this past year on the construction of our addition. Guy was very helpful, easy to communicate with, and transparent with the project. He and his crew were very efficient and thorough when it came to executing each part of the job. They were all very respectful and friendly as well. I am happy to say that Guy and Treeium help to build a safe home for my family.

James, Alameda CA"
5,Talked to 2 contractors  and felt like they weren't listening to me.. I knew my budget and I knew what I wanted..  Was ready to just save my hard earned money and give up my dream addition util I met the 3rd  contractor Guy Breuer with Treeium.. He's not a sales rep he's a Project Manager and he gave me common sense options not UP SELLING options i didn't need..  I had a real good feeling about Guy and what he said Treeium would deliver . So I signed on the dotted line and now i have  my dream room addition.. He met all times lines and his work crew's were top notch.. Thanks Guy..
5,"My wife and I selected Treeium to paint the interior of our home and it was a great experience.  Guy Portal explained all of our options and was patient and understanding as we selected our color choices.  His staff performed flawlessly, completing the job on time and leaving our home clean and looking beautiful.  We wouldn't hesitate to consider Treeium again for future projects.

Steve M"
5,"Treeium was amazing! I was referred to them by a close friend that did a bunch of work on her place after a major water leak. She loved them and said they are very fast, have fair prices and are easy to communicate with.

I had a water leak in my tentants unit. I explained to them that my tenants wanted to get back in their home ASAP. They were constantly doing whatever they could to make things go faster. They said my project would be completed in about 8 days or so. They finished it in about 5 instead. Everything looks great! They went the extra mile and helped us find the best matching materials, they were easy to communicate with and answered every text and call within minutes. That is definitely not the case with most contractors. They under-promised and overdelivered on everything! Erez, The Project Manager, was amazing! He is very personable, went out of his way to help in any way he could. After this project, I honestly feel like I have a new personal friend. I would not hesitate to hire them again!"
5,"Liran Avital and the Treeium crew completed a full kitchen and bathroom remodel for us, and we are thrilled with the results! We have had some nightmarish experiences in the past so we were reluctant to take this project. After contacting Treeium  and meeting with Liran in person, he gave us all the confidence we needed, we interviewed 2 other companies before and after we met Liran and let me tell you this, no one were even close to the professionalism and the well established reputation Treeium have and the way Liran went through every aspect of the project with us. so we decided to move forward with Treeium and so glad we did! From the start, Liran patiently worked with us to draw up the plans, scope of work, budget and timeline. His expertise and suggestions made all the difference in ensuring we made the most out of the space we have. Liran was on site overseeing his crew for flawless execution. He lent his expertise in helping me select final touches like drawer pulls, kitchen faucets and lighting and bathroom layout and design. The crew was very  polite, nice and clean throughout the whole time of the remodeling. Every day I received emails or phone calls updating me what was happening, who was coming and going, when payments were due etc. I felt completely looped in and reassured at the overall coordination of all the people involved, everything Liran had promised he delivered! This is a top notch company and Liran was a fantastic project manager and was very easy to work with . The project was completed on time. Liran is honest, detail oriented and very professional. Thank you Liran and the Treeium crew for my new kitchen and bathroom. It was a pleasure to work with you. We highly recommend Liran Avital  and Treeium crew for smooth, peaceful remodeling process and quality work for everyone who is thinking to remodel his house!"
5,I hired Treeium for my remodeling project and couldn’t be happier with my decision. I had a wonderful experience with the company and my project manager Guy Borestein. He was always available for me throughout the entire process. He gave us an excellent customer service. Out project turned out great. Once again thank you Treeium for a job well done.
1,"We worked with Guy who is very personable, but the job that needed to be done took well over the time we were told  I understand that there are complications when doing a complex design, but the communication was horrible and took well over 6 months!   

We were very clear in our expectations and when it came to the build we didn't actually hire Treeium.  Their bid was more than $100K over what we were bid by other companies.  They tried to work with us and give us discounts, but in the end we went with another contractor.  

This is where things were very frustrating.  We were told the plans would be complete and ready to build.  There were issues with the plans that the contractor had to modify (simple measurements and walls where there couldn't be).  These small issues my contractor was able to work with the inspectors but the biggest issue was the retaining walls below our build.  They didn't put them where needed, nor tall enough and when we called them back to fix the problem, we were billed almost $1000 to fix!  We are still fighting them to not pay for this bill.  Instead of responding to us and fixing the problem they say we should expect changes!    I can see if we changed the plans  - but this was a blatant mistake by the engineer and we should NOT be billed because they did the plans wrong in the first place - DISAPPOINTING to say the least!  :("
5,"Up to this point am very happy with the work performed,Erez was there answering my questions and concerns,thank you"
5,"I’ve known Erez Shifferman for years now but I’ve never had the need to work with him professionally for any of the construction services he offers. When I learned Erez offers energy efficient upgrades as an energy upgrade California contractor and after discussing some ideas, I felt very comfortable with letting Erez perform the upgrades to my home. Needless to say, Erez made the experience flawless and super smooth even when I was out of state for the majority part of the work. Erez is one of those people you immediately feel like you can trust, as he’s a straight shooter, professional, personable and honest. My energy efficient upgrades are making a huge difference to my home and I’m very content with the work performed. Thank you Erez for making this happen for me and I’m happy we could do business together!"
5,"I acquired several bids to remodel my home and was very pleased to have contracted with Treeium, Inc.  My projects varied in expertise from building a second story wrap around deck, replacement of custom skylights, redoing the concrete driveway and other varied projects to bring my older home up to date.  Dotan, the Project Manager, was professional, knowledgeable, organized, and made time to make sure I was updated on all facets of the project, including communicating with me outside of business hours.  Furthermore, the Treemium team was pleasant, courteous and respectful of my property.  I would recommend them to anyone who is considering remodeling their home and would hire Treeium, Inc. again."
5,"Excellent job was done by Treeium & their crew. After looking around for over 3 months for a good contractor, I was finally referred to Treeium. Their project manager was friendly, knowledgeable, professional and most of all honest!! Absolutely no pressure tactics which made me feel comfortable with him. We decided to go with them to remodel our kitchen & do some landscaping in the backyard. They installed artificial turf and water-conversant plants and now my backyard looks beautiful. My kitchen was really old, needed everything updated. They gave me new cabinets, countertops, tile, and lighting. It literally looks like a new house and my friends are always astonished when they come over. 

I want to personally thank Treeium for the help and making this whole process easy. You took care of absolutely everything and your entire crew was very nice and polite the whole time. Don't know what I would've done without you. I'll definitely recommend treeium to everyone!"
5,"I found Treeium and hired them for a full high-end remodel of an existing 2,600 SF home in Playa del Rey, which was an investment/flip. They were well-priced, fair, very experienced and their workmanship was exceptional. They have multiple offices and a large staff, which was comforting to know going into the job. Guy Barnea and Ron Admony both acted as the PM's and they were fantastic. They were easily accessible throughout the entire process and the only change orders we had on the job were for scope that I decided to add at my own discretion. Would definitely use again."
5,"I did a complete remodel of a mobile home in Camarillo Springs (where you own the land), with Treeium. They did an amazing job and the service and quality were all amazing. They took everything down to the studs and built a home that you would NEVER know now is a mobile home. Ari and Guy were amazing and took care of everything from beginning to end! 
I highly recommend them!
Doris S."
5,"I was refereed to Treeium by a friend of mine because he had heard the horror stories I've had with other contractors in the past. He told me they were professional, reliable, and high quality..and wow he was right! Best remodeling experience I've ever had. We did a complete new roof for our home and it came out beautiful. All the workers were very friendly, and I was constantly kept updated as the project was progressing. I strongly recommend Treeium and will for sure be using them again."
4,"After waiting approximately 12 to 13 years to make a decision to semi-remodel our 1947 kitchen, we found ourselves hunting for the right company to perform high quality work for us in a timely fashion. We interviewed approximately 6 to 7 companies and we decided to award the contract Treeuim to do the work.  Our project manager is Guy Bornstein and I can't say enough about his enthusiasm and professionalism! He represents his company well, and while we are in week two of our remodel so far most everything is going well and I can't wait to update our friends & family when everything is finished!"
5,"Guy Borenstein is the guy you want leading your project!!!!! I can't say enough about him and his crew. An absolute professional. Everything was done within the time frame he gave us and was done with the highest standards. My new kitchen looks amazing. His crew was very nice, polite, and worked so hard to get the job done. Guy was always in contact with updates on the remodel and there at anytime to answer any questions I had. His ideas really made a difference in the way the kitchen came together. His knowledge and vision made working with him so easy. The kitchen is now the place where we spend all our time. Couldn't be happier. We plan on doing more work to the house later and I wouldn't call anyone else."
5,"Treeium Inc was hired to replace my problematic flat roof and the job was very well done. We passed both inspections first strike and overall we're very satisfied. So much can be said about a roof job other than it looks good, but definitely plenty can be said about the project manager behind the scene who made it all happen, Erez Shifferman. I've been around for a while to know that Erez is a rarity in the construction industry. His integrity, communication skills and attention to details are something to take pride in, and his company should know about it. Erez brings to the table everything he promises and it is obvious he cares about what he does, how he does it and who he does it for. I'm not sure how many project managers Treeium employes, but if half of them are carved from the same material Erez is carved it is crystal clear to me how Treeium was able to be featured in magazines such Inc 500 and Forbes. It's all about the individuals behind the scene…. All the power to you guys!"
5,"I was looking to have my windows and slider door replaced. I interviewed a few different companies and then met with Treeium's representatives, Rose Chang and Neev Kugel. They were very professional from start to finish. My biggest challenge was finances and Rose and Neev were able to assist me by setting me up with the HERO program. They were extremely honest and explained everything to me before we proceeded forward with our agreement. Throughout the whole process they kept me updated regarding everything that was happening and about to happen. They were onsite to supervise and keep the project on schedule. I was so pleased with the service that I decided to have them do my exterior paint of the house. It was overall a wonderful experience and I would strongly recommend Rose and Neev and the Treeium team for anyone considering with a quality company. Thank you Rose and Neev!!!"
5,"We hired Treeium for partial renovation of our house which included remodeling of the bathrooms, replacement carpet with hardwood floor and porcelain tiles, painting walls, ceiling, windows (inside and outside), doors and some cabinets, and replacement and installation of new fans, lights, switches, circuits, plumbing, and air-conditioner duct covers. One of the challenges was that we did not move our furniture and boxed staff out of the house, and the team kept moving all those around and disassembled and reassembled furniture as it was necessary. We even managed to stay at home for the first two-three weeks of the renovation. In agreement with Treeium, we chose the option to select and buy vanities, air-jet bath tub, faucets, and such materials as floor wood and tiles by ourselves. Shower glass-doors, LED lights, and miscellaneous parts and materials were provided by Treeium. 
Project manager, Lior Lazarovich, leaded the team very professionally, friendly, and flexible. He tried to satisfy all our requests. He was in touch with us on a daily basis, or more often when it was necessary.  In his messages, he updated us every evening. Seeing the high quality of the team work, we asked to add to the project some extra work that we initially did not considered.  Lior explained all our possibilities and helped make the proper choices.  We have never experienced any push from him.  Despite of the additional work, the project was completed in time. The team worked on Saturdays and sometimes on Sundays. We also thank Carlos Escrobar for high quality and optimal solutions.  Thank you, guys, very much!
Half-year later we are still very satisfied with the work done by Treeium.  All neighbors, friends, and other visitors to our house, who had seen the house before the renovation, are usually impressed and comments positively. Some told us that we are lucky to find such a company. All renovated entities still look nice and work properly. The only necessary replacement was a malfunctioned LED light, which Treeium quickly replaced without any charges after my single call to Lior.  We want to thank Lior again for his fine work and customer oriented attitude, and Treeium management for organizing such a good company."
5,"We hired Treeium for whole house renovation. We just bought this old condo, and nothing had been updated at least 15 years. Our project manager was MIKE, he is very responsible, whatever or whenever we needed to talk to him, he responded quickly. Even a little problem, he took care of it immediately. And his team, they're all awesome! They work hard, and make sure everything works and looks great. I honestly some of other contractors might do their work cheaper, but comes to the quality of work, can't beat Treeium. Now our condo came back to life and looks like a new one. Thanks to MIKE and his team!"
5,"Treeium provided & installed beautiful energy efficient windows and a sliding door in our home and we couldn't be happier over all.  Erez Shifferman who worked with us as the manager for the project is an honest, professional and extremely easy to work & communicate with. The service he gave us was superb and we can't imagine being treated any better. I already have a few family members lined up to check out my beautiful new windows and sliding door, so we hope to refer more business to Erez and Treeium in the near future!"
5,"I hired Treeium, Inc to take care of my leaky deck and planters after having water damage due to bad original design and construction of the deck/planters. The project manager who met with me (and later on was responsible for my project) was Erez Shifferman. As opposed to another company that offered a partial fix to remedy the problem, Erez suggested a different approach of redoing the deck entirely to make sure we're not just masking the problem but actually taking care of it from the root. Although the price point was higher than the other company (for the obvious reason that the solution/scope of work suggested by Erez was much more involved), I felt that this would optimally be the better approach for my piece of mind. Overall and throughout the project, Erez kept me involved on a daily basis with pictures and updates and made me feel at ease that I was being taken care of. Erez made sure to keep superb fluent communication with me and I can honestly say that my experience with Treeium as a company and Erez as the project manager who ran my project was flawless, smooth and stress free. It was very noticeable that Erez genuinely went the extra mile for me and you can tell he's just that type of a professional person who would do the same for all of his clients. I was really impressed as well with their headquarters office and operation when I came in to sign the paperwork, you can definitely tell that they're a top notch company that takes great pride in their customer service and quality of work. No more working with shady companies that operate from PO boxes...
I am 100% satisfied with the service and quality of workmanship I was provided with, and would definitely recommend Erez & Treeium to whoever I know who might be in need of any construction service. Thanks guys!"
5,"I hired Treeium Inc. for my much needed energy efficient upgrades around the house which included a complete replacement of my roof and windows. The project manager who worked with me was Erez Shifferman, a true professional, easy going, friendly and caring person whom I knew was going to take care of me and my project from the first time we sat by the table. Sure enough, I was right. My project was ran seamlessly, smoothly and with no glitches whatsoever which is a rarity in the construction world. I can already tell how much of an impact my new roof and windows are having on the temperature and comfort inside my home. Thank you Erez for delivering everything you promised, I will be more than happy to refer you to anyone I know who might be able to benefit from your outstanding service."
5,"Treeium to the rescue!!  I had the BEST Project Manager Lior Lazarovich.  He was patient, kind and very quick to respond to my calls.  Lior and his crew came in to start My Complete Kitchen Remodel on January 9th.  Along with the Kitchen remodel on January 11th Treeium replaced Two Sliding Glass Doors and Three Windows!!!  All these guys were no nonsense take care of business workers.  Everything was done fast, clean & efficient! I was simply amazed at how everything was planned out like clock work (Boom, Boom, Boom).  The organization that Lior maintained with his crew and keeping my sanity in check throughout all this activity was BRILLIANT!!  My finished project was realized on February 8th. My dream has come true!!!  I would definitely call Treeium again for another project without hesitation!!"
5,"We were looking to have a Solar system installed on our home as our electric bills started to escalate drastically over the years. We interviewed a few companies to have this project done including Treeium. Treeium sent out their Solar Specialist, Mr. Neev Kugel, to assess our needs and discuss the effects and benefits of going Solar. Upon meeting Neev, we felt very comfortable with him and immediately noticed that he was far more knowledgeable regarding Solar than any other representative we had met before. He explained everything to us, he let us know ahead of time that we will need to upgrade our main electrical panel as a part of the Solar installation (something that no other representative had mentioned before) and he told us exactly what we should expect throughout each stage of this project. 
Later on, we were even more satisfied and confident in our decision of choosing Treeium and Neev as they found out that we had an open permit with our county for a patio project we took on in the past. The permit was never finalized and had we not met Neev on time, we would have paid a heavy fee to the county for not dealing with this properly. 
Neev assisted us with taking care of this, he took care of the Solar and electrical panel installation, and made sure to visit the project often to make sure everything was done according to his standards. 
It was a really great experience working with Neev and the Treeium team on this project. We were definitely impressed by the professionalism and the integrity that both Treeium and Neev held.
We recommend Treeium to anyone considering a home remodeling project and we strongly recommend that you ask specifically for Neev should the company allow. You won’t regret it. Thank you Neev and Treeium for all that you have done for us."
5,My overall experience with Treeium and Guy Breuer was fantastic. They made me feel at ease with peace of mind though out the duration of the kitchen remodel by letting me know what they were doing or going to do at the end of everyday they were here. I felt very comfortable and trust Guy Breuer and his team with my home when I leave the house to go shopping for Christmas gifts. The kitchen remodel was completed a little over 3 weeks just in time for my birthday on Christmas. I would recommend Treeium and Guy Breuer and his team if you’re considering getting a kitchen remodel.
5,"It was time for us to go through a roof replacement, and being something we never plan to do again, we were very picky in selecting the contractor who will do the job for us. When we met and talked to Erez Shifferman with Treeium, he immediately ""stood out from the crowd"" with his friendly personality, high energy, good vibe and real world professionalism. Erez is a true asset to his company, you could really tell he cares for his customers, loves what he does and takes pride in who he does it for. Erez explained to us in detail the process of replacing our roof, he stood up to his word and provided everything he promised. We certainly had an excellent experience with Treeium as a company and Erez as an individual, and we will definitely recommend him to anyone we know who might need any construction services. A+++ all the way!"
5,My second project with Treeium was exterior painting for my house. It turned out excellent the colors were great. The work on the trim was very precise. Don the project manager was thoroughly professional & always on time. We are very happy with the work.
5,"Treeium did work on my home for my windows, air conditioning and some roof work. The project manager they assigned to me was Avihen Levanon and he was great. Everything was explained thoroughly and my family and I are very satisfied with the finished work. We didn't really have any issues come up which was surprising due to horror stories we've heard with some other remodeling companies. I definitely recommend Treeium to anyone looking to do work on their home"
5,"I was in the market for a complete bathroom remodel and a small bathroom upgrade. I checked out a few companies and after careful consideration decided on Treeium. After meeting with Raz, I was so impressed with his knowledge and professionalism that had no problem in making my decision to have them do the work. The workers have been efficient and have been meeting their deadlines. We're actually ahead of schedule, which makes me very happy. I would definitely recommend their services for any home renovations."
5,"My husband and I wanted to add living space to our living room. I found Treeium on line and read their reviews.  I was impressed with the information. Treeium has it's in-house engineering and architectural department which helped us to obtain the blue print and the permit for the construction.  Our project manager, Don, has communicated through-out the planning process and has done a great job keeping us updated on the progress. I'm very excited to get our project started. 
     Our project is now completed and I can't tell you how wonderful it has turned out to be.  I wanted the wall moved out to give 230 sq. ft. of extra living space.  Everything I envisioned  from the day we started the planning process and by the end of the complete the results were higher than my expectations.  My neighbors have watch the progress and are awaiting to come over to experience the completed addition that has completely change my living room, with a bay window looking out into the patio/back yard.  
       Don, project manger, communicated throughout the entire project on the daily duties, worked closely with his foremen to insure great workmanship, quality assurance and he takes a lot of pictures. I recommend Treeium as a qualified contractor/re-modeler.  Make sure to ask for Don, the big Russian Armenian gentleman.  We love our remodel."
5,"Beyond satisfied with the work Treeium did with our new windows instalation for my home.
They got the work done fast , very friendly and welcoming team.
Erez has an amazing energy, and great personality. He explained to detail the process for us to qualify to get our windows changed. Any question we had , he was able to answer and get us out of dought. I recomend treeium they did an amzing job and are looking out to help home owners improve their homes"
5,"I was looking to upgrade my master bathroom as it was pretty old. I met with a few companies and decided to hire Treeium mainly because of their reputation and the professionalism of the project manager they sent over, Neev Kugel. He was very knowledgeable and managed to discuss everything in detail: scope of work, timelines, pricing, etc. I have never gone through a process like this before and Neev was able to simply break it down in a way that didn’t leave any room for questions. I was extremely impressed by his attention to details and little did I know how this would play a major factor throughout the remodel itself. He was on top of the project at all times and made sure I was always aware of what was going on in my house. When we met, Neev prepared me that this project would take anywhere between three weeks to a month. Imagine my surprise when the whole remodel was done and over with in two and a half weeks! I was so pleasantly surprised that I decided to hire Neev and the Treeium team to also take care of my Kitchen. I met with the Treeium designer and similarly to the bathroom job, the Kitchen was completed in a timely fashion and the end result came out beautiful!
To whomever is reading this review, don’t waste your time by looking anywhere else. I strongly recommend Treeium and specifically Neev Kugel to take care of any of your remodeling needs. They did an amazing job for me and I know that I will hire them again in the future! Thank you Treeium and a special thanks to you Neev for making this process so easy for me and for delivering on everything you had promised!"
5,"We had a great experience with Treeium. We had a larger island built in the kitchen of our new home. They did a great job matching the material to the existing finish and they deliver it within the promised time frame. Erez Shifferman was our project manager. He is very personable guy and understood our needs from day one. Erez work hard to ensure that everything was not less than perfect and always kept us informed about how everything was progressing. The project involved the demolition of our old island, fabrication of a costume island, electrical work, and installation. 
I highly recommend this company and we will definitely be using them for other projects we have in mind."
5,"We had a leak in our 2nd bathroom. I saw that Treeium had great reviews. We reached out to them and we were contacted by one of their Project Managers, Lior Lazarovich. We decided to replace our bathtub with a shower and replaced the toilet, vanity and flooring. We agreed on contract terms and Lior called their tile & flooring partner to make an appointment so that we had access to Treeium pricing. Our entire remodel was seamless from beginning to end. But what made our experience exceptional was having Lior as our Project Manager. He communicated next steps to us on a daily basis. We always knew where we were in the process. Lior also had a Supervisor, Gady onsite to oversee the crew. Gady was also communicating next steps. And if you have never installed a shower, there are many steps. We passed inspection with no issues because Doing things right is a priority for Lior. Lior has great passion for his work and this shines through in everything he does. We are looking forward to remodeling our master bath in the future. Our first call will be to Lior. We highly recommend him & his team! Laurie & Mike from Irvine."
5,I had a smell in my basement and my friends advised me that it may be mold. I went on home advisor and Treeium was the first company that showed up. The representative was Don Mkhitarian. He was very knowledgeable about the field and helped us with a mold test. The test results came back positive. I appreciated the fact that Don communicated with us through out the process and he explained the different types of mold that we had and the health hazard that each were responsible for.  We are very happy to take action with Treeium and looking forward for Don To help us with the remediation process. I recommend Treeium to all home owners.
5,"Was referred to Guy Borenstein by a friend who had a similar project done and was happy with the work. He has been responsive, work began on time and the workers have been clean and prompt. Completely renovating a bathroom from the studs out, so far all has gone as promised and on schedule."
5,"I was looking to increase the energy efficiency of my house as it was poorly insulated. I called a few companies and decided to hire Treeium to conduct an energy audit for me to better understand what I can do to improve my home. Upon receiving the energy audit results, I met with Treeium’s project managers Neev Kugel and Avihen Levanon to go over the scope of work involved with the energy audit results. I was so impressed with their knowledge, demeanor, and the fact that I didn’t feel pressured to do anything, that I decided to go ahead and hire them to do the work for me which included: wall and attic insulation, exterior paint, main electrical panel upgrade and replacing my windows. Neev and Avihen made sure to always keep me posted regarding the project’s progress, they were very quick to handle any issues which came up, and overall were extremely professional and efficient in making sure everything ran like clockwork. I was so impressed with their work that I decided to also hire them to take care of my front yard and install drought tolerant landscape for me, and I must say that it came out BEAUTIFUL!
Thank you Neev and Avihen for your continued care and service throughout this project. It was a pleasure working with you and I would strongly recommend Neev, Avihen and Treeium to whomever is considering going through their next remodel!"
5,Erez Shifferman and the Treeium team have been a pleasure to work with.  Their professionalism and attention to detail make any project easy. We are looking forward to working with Erez again in the near future.
5,"Not realizing that windows would drastically help in our duplex's curb appeal, Erez Shifferman, our project manager suggested we consider the offer after explaining all the benefits of having new energy efficient windows installed. After much deliberation and Erez explaining to us the payment plan, we decided to give it a go. Erez was very attentive every step of the way, from explaining the paperwork to setting up an installation appointment that worked with our schedule. The windows installers were very handy and worked with all the clutter we had at the moment. The installation was swift and they accommodated last minute changes we made with the window plans. We instantly saw the difference and are happy with the work that they did. Would recommend to others, especially Erez our project manager, who after our installation came to make sure the job was well done and finish off any paperwork and any lingering questions we may have had. Thanks Erez!"
5,"Kelley here.
Guy Borenstein Was my contractor . He was recommended by a family member.  I got three estimates in this price range . Guy had the best price , but more he had knowledge and suggestions and facts that the others had not offered ! I felt that it would be a more professional job. The master bath is gorgeous and well constructed . We gutted it and the team with Maya , Lyle , Moses and Micha and the painter are all experts . They took me shopping and it was a group effort . They were patient with my artistic side .Thanks ."
5,"As a homeowner I usually don’t speak to people who knock on my door and offer services, but on that one day a young man, Erez Shifferman, knocked on my door with a smile and said they were working in my neighborhood (which they were). He introduced me to their company and what they were doing. Overall, Erez just made it easy for me to talk to him. I was badly in need of a new roof and decided to give it a try. After reviewing his company’s good history I decided to go with Treeium. 

I felt my service was excellent, the customer service and attention I received from Erez were really second to none. Throughout the project I felt as if I was Erez's only customer and his only running project, but I know I was not! I’m very happy with the service I was given and the new roof I have. I already referred Treeium and Erez to a few acquaintances and I will recommend them to anyone who needs work at their home. The project was efficiently completed on time and the results are excellent. Thank you Erez and Treeium!"
5,"It's a rare thing to find a company that offers top quality workmanship, excellent speed at getting the work done – and competitive pricing. Treeium has delivered on all of the above… and more! Our project manager, Erez Shifferman and his team have worked magic on my 62 year-old, ranch-style home. After initially stressing over the thought of hiring and coordinating 5 or 6 individual contractors for a long overdue remodel/renovation, we met with Erez – who presented my wife and I with an inclusive, energy-efficient plan to replace our cedar shingled roof, old wood windows and original wood siding with all-new eco-friendly products.

Erez was always either available on-site or by cell – and ALWAYS responsive to calls or texts throughout the day or eve (a perpetual fear of mine, after hearing various accounts of contractor-caused renovations-gone-wrong from friends and colleagues) to discuss project scheduling and milestones, or to address any personal concerns. From the demo stage to the final stucco applications, Erez would always check in with his team, then touch base with me with project progress and updates. Throughout the process, as I’m sure many homeowners are guilty of, my wife and I made personal adjustments to our project vision – to which Erez was equally gracious and accommodating. Among the many other favorable impressions made by team Treeium was the punctuality and the positive attitude of the crew – and if you happen to live in the SoCal region, be sure to request the ‘3 Georges’. IMHO, these guys bent over backwards to make our home remodel a pleasurable experience!

Our project is nearly done, the new exterior now looks practically brand new – and I couldn't be happier. Personally, I found Erez's professionalism to be truly extraordinary. He followed through on everything he represented – making sure everything was not just acceptable – but perfectly to my liking. In sum, I would recommend Treeium to anyone who wants their home to shine!"
5,"My wife and were planning on hiring a contractor that would help us with vinyl fence installation for our backyard. We had a few estimates already and wanted to get our third one as recommended. Our third appointment was set with Treeium. Treeium is a nationally ranked full remodeler that has all the licenses necessary to complete any home renovation project and is currently ranked 30th out of the Top 500 qualified remodelers Nationwide and that was the reason we contacted Treeium. We were very Pleased with the Project Manager Don Mkhitarian that came to see us. He was very Knowledgeable about every aspect of the job. He took his time to measure every detail as well as contact the Manager of the Vinyl fence department at Treeium ""Jack"" and review all the details that would be entailed  in the installation process. We thought Don was very Honest and Genuine with us. My wife and I are retired and we had a set budget for the project, but after the meeting with Don, we both realized that the Job entails more than what we thought. We thank Don for his input and Professionalism and we are going to restrategize our budget and hopefully have Don help us with the project at a later time."
5,Guy Kritshtein was our project manager and was terrific!  He was very personable and knowledgeable. Guy was always just a phone call away.  The remodeling of our kitchen and bathroom was completed without problems.  They are a real eco home remodeling company.  I will be using this company again when I redo the backyard.
5,"Five star rating!  My experience working with the Treeium Team, generally, and Project Manager, Eli Gerloy, specifically, was fantastic.  Eli oversaw a complicated kitchen/living area/bathroom remodel project at our home.  Eli provided us with a comprehensive plan and associated quote for the project and ensured that the our budget was maintained, despite a couple of plan modifications along the way.  Eli and his team were all very knowledgeable and responsive.  I highly recommend Treeium and will work with them again down-the-road.  If you choose to do so, ask for Eli - he will take care of you."

Who after our installation, came to make sure the job was well done and finish off any paperwork and any lingering questions we may have had. Thanks Erez!"
5,"I've contracted three projects with Treeium, with Liran Avital as the project manager.  The first and most ambitious was a bathroom renovation.  I did my own design for the bathroom, which ended up being more work for Liran and his crew than he was originally expecting. But even with the increased scope, he stuck to his original bid, and he got the project done within the time estimate.  The project turned out great; the bathroom is beautiful!  And I was really impressed with everone on his crew - just the right mix of professional and friendly, and proud of their craft (especially the guys who did our tile work!)  I'm not going to pretend everything was perfect - there were a few minor delays that could have been avoided, and on one of the smaller projects, a miscommunication about one of the materials used.  But weighing everything, Liran definitely earned a five-star review!"
5,"I interviewed quite a few companies to remodel my bathroom and upgrade my kitchen, when Don and Tomir came to give me a quote I was immediately impressed. From the beginning of the process I felt confident that I had hired the right team and I felt secure with Robert and his guys being in my home when I wasn't able to be there. Don and Tomir were always in contact with me and gave me a schedule so I would always know what was going to happen the next day, or in that week. 
I am very happy with the quality of the work and I know that if I ever have an issue with any of the work that has been done, I can text Don and Tomir and they will take care of me. I appreciate the attention and support I have had the whole project. Most importantly... I love my new bathroom and kitchen!!"
5,"I am very pleased with Treeium. My main contact was Guy Breuer who was very congenial and informative from the beginning. Guy originally set me up with Danny, who became my architect and worked with me to develop the plans for my addition. We added a garage, a bathroom, an extra room, and extended the front room. Danny took care of everything with the county and I only had to go to the county office once. The plans came out just the way I had foreseen. 

The cost was a little more than I wanted to pay but it was well worth it. From foundation to roof and everything in between supplies were top grade and so was the workmanship. I am very grateful for our foreman Angel, he and his crew worked every day, some weeks including Sundays to get my project done. And to top it all he and Guy kept me informed of their progress and what to expect the following week. 

Originally I was told that it would take 3 to 4 months, which was accurate since they finished in a little over 3 months and that was with a few delays caused by the rain.

I have received nothing but compliments from my neighbors and even random people passing by. Thank you Treeium."
5,"We were looking an energy efficient remodel that included air conditioning, new lighting, insulation and window replacement, a new electrical panel and were also considering solar. We turned to Treeium because we needed a contractor that was eligible to work under California's P.A.C.E. program (we went with Ygrene for financing), and could cover the full scope of services. My main points of contact were Neev Kugel and Ofer Dub. I found them to be both very responsive to our needs and schedule and pragmatic in their approach. The scope grew to include a rewire based on needs dictated by living in an old house, though they also recommended to wait for solar before understanding the new energy dynamics post-improvements, which insured the investment was going to the most needed items. Everything was seamless between Treeium and Ygrene. They went the extra mile to make sure we were satisfied with the work. Highly recommended."
5,"I am very pleased with the job Treeium construction and the help of the project manager Liran Avital did on my home.  The project included stone flooring, carpet, all new cabinetry and countertops.  My home looks amazing, because the meticulous work by this company and the expertise of Liran who made recommendations had the project move along quickly and oversaw work as it was being done."
5,From start to finish Treeium has made our visions a reality.. Equipped with highly trained professionals within the home renovation business they provided great service and products.
4,"We had a significant remodel on a house we just bought - some would say it was a ""gut"" job. I don't think a single room remained untouched and we even deliberately moved retaining walls and had to fortify in other areas as a result. Treeium came in very competitively priced and provided some legit references ultimately winning the business. The work done was solid and Ron Admony - who was our project manager - in particular should be singled out. He was on site frequently to supervise the progress, and made himself available practically 24/7 via phone or text. In many cases as addenda popped up he would work with us to keep the spend in line. Definitely ask for Ron on your project when you call them!"
5,"I would like to share my story, about my experience I had with Treeium.

I contacted Treeium to replace my soak in tub with a shower.
I have a medical issue with both of my knees and I am having a difficult time entering my tub. I am a retired veteran and have been doing physical labor throughout my life which causes my knees to ache. 

Guy Borenstein from Treeium came in to give me a bid on the project. Guy listened to my needs and advised me on what my opinion were. Guy's price was more than my budget which I can afford (I have not done any construction work for over a decade, I just couldn't afford it). And was not aware of construction prices in today's market.

I told Guy that I cannot afford to do the work at this time.
I could sence Guy wanted to help in any way he can, and he did smile emoticon

Guy asked if he could step out for a few min to speak to his office.After a few min Guy came in and explained to me about a program were Treeium gives back to the Community and there is a possibility that I could qualify to have my bathroom remodel done at no charge, and YES FREE!


We filled out the application and within a few weeks I found out that Treeum is going to sponsor my poroject and I will be receiving a new bathroom remodel at no charge . I never won anything in my life and can't believe this was happing to me.Within 3-4 weeks my bathroom was completed and it came out better then I ever dreamed of.

I want to thank Treeium and Guy Borenstein for making my life ""change for better""

 Sincerely,
 Allan and Terri Hewett"
5,"I love my new fireplace tile! I found Treeium on Home Advisor and from start to finish the experience was great. These guys are the real deal. I felt very secure that I was dealing with a legitimate company who has been in OC for many years (and who has tons of great reviews!) I love that they have in-house contractors for whatever job you need and don't hire sub-subtractors to get the work done. Both Don (Project Manager) and Robert (Tile Contractor) were amazing. Don kept in touch throughout the project and Robert went above and beyond to make sure the project was perfect. He also kept the workspace clean which was a bonus. Overall, thrilled with the results and LOVE THIS COMPANY! I will definitely call them again for my next project."
5,"A few months ago, my husband and I had Treeium remodel our Master Bathroom. Our Project Manager was Neev Kugel and he was absolutely phenomenal to work with. We couldn't be happier. So recently we decided to do a total remodel on our stairs too, so of course we called Neev at Treeium. Once again, he was excellent to work with. Our stairs were done beautifully and as always the customer service and quality of work were all at the highest level. Just like our Master Bathroom remodel, our Project Manager Neev Kugel was always on top of the project from start to finish. We have received so many compliments on our new stairs. Thank you Treeium, and even more specifically, thank you Neev!"
5,"We are very pleased with our new bathroom! Liran Avital was the project manager and he listened well to our description of what we wanted in the remodel. Each step of the project was carefully planned and carried out, and the finished room meets all our goals and expectations!
Virginia Connell"
4,"My name is James Peery. I hired Treeium for a bathroom remodel. I went on Home Advisors and was given the name of three contractors. The only one who called me was Treeium. 

I was contacted by project manager Don. He showed up on time, was very interested in my needs, and gave me a quote. I found Don to be knowledgeable, polite, and most of all he was not ""pushy"" about me signing with Treeium. Don also made it a point to come by the project weekly to check progress.

I also dealt with Devon who works in client complaints and quality control. I found Devon to be a breath of fresh air who took care of all the issues I wanted addressed. Devon even called me on her day off to keep me up to date on the resolution of my issues. I wasn't having quality issues as much as I was frustrated with the length of the project and some other minor issues. Devon treated all my issues as if they were major and she was always pleasant. 

I also dealt with the field quality control manager. His name is Dror. He was awesome. He listened to my concerns, took pictures, and made sure all the work was done to his standards and mine. Dror was great to work with.

Overall my remodel turned out great. The price didn't change and the work looks awesome. I would recommend Treeium for anyone needing construction work done."
3,Very helpful and always great communication. The project managers were really wonderful and did their best to try and make sure things were as we wanted.
5,"Erez Shifferman, Sam and their Crew at Treeium showed up on time from day one. They are a very professional bunch. They took stress off my shoulders when it came to doing mold remediation in my Master Bathroom. Even though the job was small, they took it VERY seriously because the problem was serious. I really thank them all. His crew members were clean, fast, and they very reliable. I recommend them 100%. Erez was very helpful in explaining the work process. Every time I called or texted, he answered right away. They did an amazing job. Sam took it upon himself to make sure that the mold remediation when smooth and clean. Great job guys!!!"
5,We completed our project on 03-15-2016. Erez Shifferman project manager and his crew did an amazing job on remodeling our master bathroom. They converted a walking shower to a roll in shower and lowered one sink to make these wheelchair accessible. Erez Shifferman was very professional. He keep us informed and he help make this a good experience. we would recommend Treeium to others and have them request Erez Shifferman. It was a pleasure working with him..
5,"I just wanted to commend Treeium for an outstanding job. My husband and I have worked with a couple of different contractors and this is the best experience we have had by far. Our Project Manager, Neev, was so helpful. He was with us every step of the way. We never had to wait long for responses to our questions and he was always solution oriented. If we had a question, he had an answer. If we wanted something addressed, he made it happen. We truly felt like he had our best interest in mind. We never felt pressured, it was about what was best for us and our project. The execution and craftsmanship of our kitchen is beyond our expectations. We would highly recommend Treeium and Neev to anyone! He made the stressful experience of a kitchen renovation pretty pain free."
5,"great general contractor for big jobs, thorough bids submitted promptly. highly recommended. 

their project managers take full ownership of the bidding and supervising process. you can tell the employees have high morale and care deeply about their craftsmanship. 

for our project, they came through with a bid on the bathroom which was fair, but the kitchen was not reasonable. overall, they were 5k over the next lowest bid. Still, id consider hiring Treeium on future projects.. they were very honest and not afraid to put things into writing."
4,"We had a complete kitchen remodel done (changed layout, cabinets, flooring, lighting, etc), along with extra floor replacement in the hallway and family room. After interviewing 3 contractors, Treeium's project manager, Liran Avital, was the only one who really listened to what we wanted as opposed to what is typically done. He proposed options and considerations, and yes we had to make trade offs, but we are so happy with our new kitchen. They were very professional about presenting a visual design and juggling things around so we could make better design choices. The interior designer Michelle was helpful about promoting design strategies and guiding us in our decision making.  Norm, the foreman, was very on top of the progress and keeping us posted; he was always willing to address any of our concerns. The work crews / individuals were friendly, hard working, and clean at the end of every day. Treeium was very accommodating about incorporating things which were slightly out of original scope for no extra cost.  They approached complications with a positive attitude and changed things to satisfy our requirements.    They completed the entire project ahead of schedule . We would hire Treeium again for future remodeling projects."
5,"I just wanted to say, I LOVE the work this company has done!!!! Idan Navon was a helpful Production Manager walked me though the complete process. The workers on the house did a AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL job on the work done!!! They were ALWAYS on time & trusted my judgement on the tile, wood floors & marble counter tops! The workers even helped me pack up the house since I had school & work going on & couldn't do it myself. Treeium is even helping me finish the payments so I can finish paying for the job done. Yes, you will pay a little more for the work, SO WORTH IT FOR THE WAY YOU ARE TREATED!!!! They treat you like family. I would recommend then to ANYBODY who needs renovations!"
5,"We did a complete gut and remodel to our master bath.  We met with Kobi and Amir and hired them to do the job. We received the quality promised at the price promised. No hidden costs during or after. The finished product is just what we wanted, and looks beautiful. I would recommend Treeium for and remodel project you have."
5,"I had such a great experience working with this company. I hired them to install a pretty complicated banister (since the handyman I haired before had already done a lot of damage that needed fixed). The project manager, Guy, was truly fantastic! He walked me through the whole process, was always super responsive and made me feel super comfortable with everything. The contractor came by upon request after hours to answer some questions, and he noticed I was moving in and offered to help out with our move.  The crew worked long hours and late to get the job done before the deadline I needed and it looks incredible and feels super sturdy. I'm so glad I found them and plan to use them to remodel my bathroom next!"
1,"We were referred to Treeium from an online website.  During our initial phone call with them, they were very polite, friendly, and professional.  We told them were were looking to do a home addition.  We had no plans and no permit.  They said they were a full service company, which means, they can do the plans for us, get the permits, and build our project.  Sounds great.  They sent out an email and text to confirm the appointment time.

When their estimator arrived, it turned into a nightmare.  We showed him a rough sketched of what we were looking to do.  He didn't both looking at our sketched and told us since we had no plans, meaning blue prints and construction documents, he can't help us.  When I said we were very clear when we made the appointment, we do not have plans yet and Treeium would have us come up with one should we decide to move forward.  He was not happy with the fact we didn't have a plan, then he just threw out a number between $80k to $1`50k without even looking at what we wanted to do.

When I said, had I known they needed plans before they gave estimates, I would not have had them come out because it was wasting our and his time.  His reply, ""Yes, you are wasting my time.""  Those were his exact words.  After he said that, I sent him on his way.  He was only at our house for five minutes.  

I called Treeium back and informed them what happened.  The lady who answer the phone pulled up our request and she said it clearly stated we had no plans, no permits, and looking for an estimate.  She apologized and offered to send someone else out.  I was so upset at this point, I told her there is no need.

I took the day off from work, the appointment was at 10am on a Wednesday, to meet with them.  I clearly wasted a day of work for a fruitless meeting.  Poor service from their estimator, very rude and extremely unprofessional."
5,"My experience with Treeium and my project manager Ron Admony has been fabulous. I was lucky enough to have stubbled upon Ron and Treeium as they were finishing a remodel in my neighborhood and was so impressed with their work I went over to talk with Ron. He immediately came over to my house and gave me his recommendations for my remodel projects. Not only was I so pleased with his ideas, but also that he took time to come over himself as he said he would that I hired Treeium. They  have continued to offer amazing customer service and quality work.   I have used Treeium for my solar installation, remodeling of  bathrooms, replacing kitchen counters, interior painting, acoustic ceiling removal and electrical work throughout my entire house. Their staff shows up as scheduled, on time and will not leave until the work is completed to your satisfaction.  They all aim to please and will work with you to make sure the end result is what you want.  My project manager, Ron Admony,  is amazing and has become a true friend, always available for any questions or concerns and makes sure that the Treeium staff knows exactly what I am expecting.  I highly recommend Treeium and Ron Admony as your project manager for all your remodel needs, they will make any home project painless."
5,"This is a review if Sam Deen and his crew.  I'm in the middle of a bathroom remodel. I originally contacted Treeium for an estimate to replace a shower in my second bath. From the very start I was very impressed with Sam Deen the project manager. Not only did he arrive on time, he was amicable, yet professional. I need several repairs to my home, so after we walked through the bathroom I asked Sam to provide me with an estimate for the other projects. Not only did he provide me with an itemized estimate that covered everything, he also provided me with individual itemized estimates. Sam and I discussed my budget and agreed to start with remodeling the first bathroom. Never, have I experienced a contractor who listens and understands.  Sam made my best interest his first priority and not how much profit he could make. Sam is reliable, trustworthy and compassionate.  He understands the concerns, financial constraints and yes the anxiety inherent to remodeling. Sam  guided me through design, selecting the tile, fixtures, vanity, etc. He is 100+% dedicated to his customers satisfaction. I have become accustomed too and look forward to Sam's morning call and his. arriving in the morning along with which ever craftsman that is needed for the day.  On the rare occasions he is not present, Sam is on the telephone and/or sending a text message. If, I have any questions or need clarification he's a phone call away. I believe his leadership and presence has helped to the project on schedule. His crew is equally amazing.  They are focused and respectful of your home.  The work area is kept orderly and all traces of materials or debris is completely removed by the end of the day.  Words cannot express how satisfied I am so far.  I am confident  the finished project will be exactly what I expect.  If you're looking for a general contractor I highly recommend you call Treeium and  ask for Sam Deen . You want be disappointed.  I'll update this review when the project has been completed."
5,"I have decided to hire Treeium to do my Kitchen Remodel and I couldn't be happier! About a month ago I met who would later become our project manager, Mr. Neev Kugel, and our experience of working with him has been nothing short of great! His professionalism, experience, and attention to details is what made us decide to move forward with him to begin with, but boy, were we in luck! Neev kept us up-to-dated at all times throughout our project. He made sure all of his workers came on time and completed their job in a timely and professional manner. He went over and beyond to make sure we were happy at any stage of our project, and even included a few extra line items that were not even included in our original agreement. I was hesitant about who I was going to hire to do our project but I am so happy we eventually decided to pick Treeium and I'm delighted to have had the chance to work with our project manager, Neev.

Thank you Treeium for giving us the Kitchen of our dreams and thank you Neev for everything!"
5,"Our new kitchen is almost finished and we've been very impressed with the work of Kobi Farkash and his Treeium team since Day 1! They're organized, clean, communicative and keep to their planned schedule. The quality of the cabinets is excellent. The granite finishing work is fantastic. The onsite work quality has been very good and the workers seem to be proud of their work and like what they're doing. Kobi over-communicates - he texts every evening or morning to remind us what's happening the next day. If we've brought up something to him, his onsite worker knows almost immediately. Kobi has an answer for everything. He is a great problem-solver too - when something didn't quite look right, he came up with several solutions to choose from. We would highly recommend Kobi as your Project Leader!"
4,My bath remodel experience with Treeium was positive.  The crews at all stages of the remodel showed up on time each morning.  There were minor issues that came up but project manager Guy Barnea addressed the issues quickly.  I liked how I was able to order the vanity and tile with the contractor discount.  I received everything I asked for and the result is a bathroom I enjoy!
5,"My name is Pamela Van Horn and I've met Ron Poliker after I've signed a contract with another company. Ron have heard that I signed the contract yet came back after 5 hours to make sure I was not been taken advantage of. He came at 8 pm and reviewed the contract with me and pointed out that there are errors, over sites and over pricing. I contacted the other company and canceled the checks and Ron made sure they will not harass me any more. He gave me a much better price and much broader service. the crew was fast and professional, Ron came in every day and listened to my needs. He had a manage fly in from the head quarters in LA to look after the project. Ron is my guardian Angel!!! 
Thank you very much Ron Poliker!!!!!
Treeium is amazing!!!"
5,"We planned to have our kitchen remodel in late of 2014 with limited budget and had three estimated quotes.  We almost made up our decision with the 2nd contractor and went to his showroom to see and choose the cabinet's door with color & the counter top (our decision already decided before we have the meeting with Ron Admony from Treeium).   Ron Admony ""Project Manager"" from Treeium was the last one that contacted us for the third quotation and had an appointment which we thought we only gave two hours for his presentation as a social manner; but we ended up to pick Ron from Treeium EVEN with highest price of the three quotations.  We are very happy that we picked Ron as our Project Manager, he was consistent to provide his support and helping us to finish the project ahead of the deadline.  As the rule of thumb, everything was not smooth and easy as we were looking for during our remodeling kitchen, there were few obstacles that impacted the progress and may delay the schedule; but Ron Admony was always available either by phone or by coming to contact us regarding of any issues that we encountered when the project started until finished.  He responded to our questions or concerns any time that we had in couple hours or personally came to help us to resolve the issues.  He also provided his inputs to help our decision on color, counter top, and/or anything that will help our remodeling kitchen looks prettier.  His goal is always to make sure his customer satisfaction and happy.  It's really a learning lesson to remodel the kitchen and we're glad that we picked Treeium with Ron Admony as our project manager to work on our project.  The final reward was our beautiful kitchen and our family really enjoyed.  Thanks Ron Admony for great job well done and we're sure to contact you for our next project.  Treeium could be the contractor if you need to pick for any home improvement projects and special Ron Admony will be your Project Manger."
5,"Even if you know what you are doing, any kind of home improvement is potentially very scary.  There are so many things that can go wrong, or unexpected problems that can arise.  So, it has been my experience, to hire a contractor that is a professional & knows what he is doing.  
I am very comfortable & confident in recommending Guy Barnea & Treeium for your home improvement project.
I don't write a lot of reviews, and most are when something goes wrong !!
But in this case, I recognize how important to find a qualified person/company to do contracting work....and want to share with everyone my very positive experience.
His prices are very competitive....(not the cheapest)....but the cheapest price normally gets you the cheapest work....which usually makes it ultimately not the cheapest. And why would you not want the best quality work possible.
Guy's attention to detail, only made me extremely comfortable & confident about my expectations. Everyone from his laborers to supervisors accomplished everything I had asked for and Guy's output only made the ""hurdles"" minimal and made me a very satisfied customer.  
I think the best thing I can say....is if (and when) I have another remodeling project....I now need to make one phone call......which makes this process even better.
Great Work Guy & Treeium............I couldn't be happier !!"
5,"I had my master bathroom done and they did a great job. They are professional and on time with the schedule. They even worked extra hours 
to complete the project. I highly recommended this company"
4,"Great job Treeium! Good customer service Guy Borenstein & Sal. Quality workmanship. Your guys were willing to go the extra mile to make our experience less stressful. They clean up at the end of the day, put furniture back if they had to move them... The project was done 1 week later than scheduled otherwise you would have gotten 5 stars."
5,"We decided to remodel our outdated kitchen and found Treeium on a home improvement website.  After making an appointment Guy Breuer,the project manager,came to discuss our needs and gave us an estimate.  The project entailed a full gut of the kitchen which went very smoothly with a minimal amount of dirt and dust.  Rene, the foreman, and his crew did a very good job of being on time and finishing the project in a reasonable 3.1/2 weeks.  All through the renovation Guy was available to help with the choosing of finishes and design choices.  Though any renovation is stressful the crew from Treeium made the experience a little less so.  We would definitely recommend Treeium."
3,I am in the middle of the project.  Guy Borenstein has been my contact and very helpful and cooperative in the planning process.
5,They replaced the my 24 year old roof that was leaking. With the materials they  use and the cost I am set for next 30 years.
5,"They not only got my kitchen done by Christmas, Kobi and his team were amazing. I will definitely use them again and strongly recommend Treeium."
5,"We just recently completed our first bathroom remodel.  We had received multiple job estimates but chose Treeium because of the excellent presentation by Kobi (who would be the assigned project manager).  He listened to our needs and wishes and gave us clear and concise planning projections.  They met all of the goals and we are so pleased with the outcome.  In fact, we were so pleased that we had them do a complete house re-wire and interior paint job.  The work crews were all extremely professional and took great efforts to accommodate, advise and complete the work within the promised timelines.  The different disciplines were knowledgable with their respective field of expertse.  Kobi visited the site often and ensured excellent communication between the crews.  In one instance there was a minor glitch with an electrical outlet.  Within one hour of our call the PM had an electician out to check it out.  All around outstanding service.  Would use this company again."
5,"Treeium is the BEST!!  We worked with Meir Barzilai and right from the beginning, he was extremely professional, always on time and courteous.  Our project was completed on time and within our budget.  We will always use Treeium for any future projects.  Work with Meir...you won't be disappointed!!"
1,I have been very dissatisfied and frustrated so far with my experience with Treeium. Work started and there were immediately issues after demolition and it took two days to get someone to come out and take a look. Communication has been very poor and they haven't communicated a project plan. I continually have to ask when/if someone is going to come out instead of being kept in the loop. I keep taking time off from work and no one shows up.
5,"I LOVE Trrium.  I built a brand new 3,000 Sq. Foot Luxury Home in Malibu and they installation of Tiles/marble/granite was flawless.  Not a single complaint.  Meir Barzilai and his team are professional, trustworthy and courteous.  The job was completed on time and within our budget.  Meir was at our home daily to oversee and make sure the job was proceeding to his quality and standards.  Extremely hands-on and very focused team with tons of experience, i would highly recommend to anybody!!!"
5,"We recently had our new Laguna Woods home renovated by Treeium.  After an initial rocky start with a person no longer with the company, owner Moty Ginsburg had Ron Admony take over as our Project Manager and he has been excellent to work with, diligent in keeping our project on track and has been completely honest with us in all our dealings. 
 
The project is completed and we are very happy with the results.   We had Treeium add a walk-in shower in one bathroom and make the second into an on-suite master bath.  In addition, they created a laundry closet and opened up the kitchen to allow for a large refrigerator with custom cabinets.  To accomplish this they needed to demolish walls, borrow into the slab for new drainage, create two new walk-in showers and a new master closet.  They installed a beautiful glass bowl vanity and custom linen closet in the master bathroom with glass tiles in the shower and along the back of the vanity.  With Ron at the helm and a very able crew, including Luis, Arturo, Juan and Alex, they were able to get the project to a stage where we could move in on time and then they completed the last stages of the project without delay.  We have received many compliments on how the project turned out and everyone who sees it agrees that Treeium did a great job.  I am attaching photos so you can see the results, however, they do not do it justice.  

We highly recommend Ron Admony and Treeium to do your next project.  Not only will they handle your project with professionalism, they understand how important this is to you and treat you and your property with respect."
5,"Treeium is the best company in la and probably in California !

5,"We hired Treeium to remodel our home which included a completely gutted kitchen, all new electrical rewire, removal of acoustic ceilings, new Travis stone fireplace, refinished hardwood floors,  paint of all walls and a tankless water heater. Itay  guided the process from beginning to end with care and concern that we would be completely satisfied with the job done by each of the contractors. Our dreams of  a small Mediterranean villa were surpassed with the outcome of our beautiful home. We are 150 per cent happy with the work performed by our contractors who were here every single day and the fantastic service from Itay. Our kitchen is going to be the envy of everyone that visits our home. Thank you for making our dreams a reality. Rose and Joe Garcia"
5,"Guy came ready to make our family feel like we don't need any further consultations! 
He was:
Friendly- Called ahead to let us know he was on his way.
Great communicator- IMPORTANT! Listens to every idea and executes it.
Enthusiastic-Really excited to get the job.
Professional-Came with his Badge around his neck w/ ID and License.
Artistic- Visualized something we would have never considered.

So I had researched many different companies to get an estimate on the remodeling process at my mothers home. Going through of course Houzz, HGTV, magazines, remodeling guides, internet, and local ads, Guy made us look no further. 

My family got larger within the year with the birth of our 1 year old son and paying $1,650 for a leased home without utilities, car payments, insurances and daily expenses. We decided to make some changes. To minimize our costs. We plan to remodel the home to make it two private family areas.
My Mother owns a home in a prime location in Atwater Village and it currently has 7 bedrooms, 4 restrooms, 2 kitchens, 1 laundry area, 2 large living rooms and dining rooms and a large front yard and back yard. Not to mention also the garage.  

I had numerous consultations about building UP and making it it a two story home. 
Until, Guy! Once he looked at the place he was so inspired that he actually got me excited after being disappointed with high quotes and bad communication of what we are trying to achieve.
He said the house has a large enough in square footage and that we do NOT need to build up. Mind you; building up you are looking at more time, Money and hard to get permits. (Almost a $2-300,000.00 job which I still have all the past contractors calling and harassing me.) He said that the house is large enough to accommodate two different families with their own private area, entrance etc.. 
He said that it was just not designed right,; It looks like a maze. All we really had to do is rearrange all aspects of the house with a good floor plan, knock down walls, and since pluming is underground  with crawl space that would be the fastest, easiest, and inexpensive solution. HE MADE MY DAY!

Out of so many consultations NOBODY gave me that option. I knew then he wasn't there to just get a job and take my money. 
Anyways he came through a few days later with his virtual 3D designer and she measured the whole house and told me that she will design a likable, livable layout and email it to me with the draft including my furniture. All I had to do is send her photos of my current furniture to incorporate them in the visual display. How awesome. I can edit and change everything to our liking. I am just so excited on the actual construction which I can not review about since we are not there yet. 
So far, So good, But I will definitely update my thoughts throughout the process."
5,"My review is way overdue, it was around this time last year  that I hired Kobi who is one of the greatest project managers I've ever dealt with. I had a fantastic experience with the entire team of Treeium. Today I'm visiting their office to review my electricity bill with them to install solar panels on my house.  Their office is just beautiful; the staff is just amazing and super friendly. It was very nice to actually put a face behind the voice. I would personally like to thank Elizabeth for helping me finance my project at great rates which I can afforded. 

My first project was a kitchen remodel that Kobi, he met all of my expectations and more. He made my dream kitchen a reality.  The cleanup crew was fantastic. I never had to worry about picking up after the contractors when they were finished for the day. 

I have recommended Treeium and Kobi to my friend which hired them as well and is super happy with her project as well. I'm looking forward to installing my solar panels on my house."
5,"I was looking for a company to do my master and main bathroom renovations, but wanted to start out with a smaller project first - stairwell, ceiling refinishing, and painting - to see how well the company managed the project.  I was initially interested in Treeium because I liked the idea that their company was doing their part to be a little more green.  

From the very first meeting with my project manager through to the end of the project, I felt I had all the information about what they could do with my project and how they would go about meeting my ideas.

When we ran into an unexpected structural problem that required additional work before we could move on, my project manager was able to quickly adjust the contract and all the work was still entirely completed on schedule.

Having used a number of different contractors for other big projects in my home, I appreciated most that they took care of the 'little things' to make the whole project look complete.  They removed some fixtures to work through the whole space instead of taking the short cut of just working around the fixtures. They caulked the gaps left from previous work so that it would blend in perfectly with their work.  And, they did some extra finishing on a couple of the walls so that the painting would look even more precise.

I was very pleased with the work Treeium did and the ease of working with them, and am planning my bathroom renovations with them now."
