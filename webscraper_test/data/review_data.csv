I would definitely work with the company again, especially Jack."
5,"I had the pleasure of working with Ben at AHI for a bathroom renovation and change of bedroom flooring in my condo.  My unit was built in 2001, and it was screaming, ""Outdated!""  Ben presented some ideas that upgraded my unit to present time.  He worked around my budget and was able to improvise when needed.  The team that Ben put together for my projects was AMAZING!!  Felix's team handled my flooring, and I absolutely love it!!  Jose and Romeo created the bathroom of my dreams.  Julian completed my dream bathroom with a custom shower door.  The quality and beauty of a custom shower door from Julian will make you frown upon any other kind of shower door... it's a game changer.  All teams were respectful of my unit by being extra clean and noise-conscious when removing the prior flooring and demolishing the bathroom.  Everyone working on my projects was detail-oriented, diligent and stayed on track with the projected date of completion.  Ben visited my unit regularly to monitor the progress of the projects.  He also assisted with answering any questions that the HOA had.  All in all, my experience with AHI was extremely positive.  Everything is beautiful - the outcome exceeds my expectations!  In addition, everything was completed within budget and on time.  Looking forward to reaching out to Ben again for my next project."

Neev was able to navigate through the workplace COVID restrictions, ensuring that only the necessary employees are on site with proper PPE and social distancing.

Neev was able to orchestrate the project despite the pandemic-imposed supply chain limitations that impacted delivery of the important construction materials (hardwood floors for the entire 2,800 sq. ft. house, tiles, etc.).

I highly recommend AHI to anyone looking for a contractor you can trust. I hope they stay in business forever, we will use them for all future renovations."
5,"I hired Hollywood Builders for a full kitchen remodel. Eli was able to look at photos of kitchens or parts of kitchens I like and came up with a design that was a great starting point. What I appreciated was how he was able to understand my style almost immediately. During the actual remodel, I was most impressed with just how quickly and easily any small mistakes (and they do happen) were rectified. The final product was just amazing! It looks great, but the best feeling was unpacking all my boxes full of kitchen stuff and finding that everything had it’s place, every drawer was used well, and there were no awkward or odd spaces that I wished I had done something different with. This kitchen is super functional and a pure joy to cook in and show off to my with family and friends."

Thank you again American Home Improvement Inc! And the crew for a great job!"

5,"I am SO happy with my renovation! I had two structural walls removed, a complete kitchen re-do as well as new floors, lighting, baseboards and ceilings throughout the main living space of my house. David , Sam and the guys were phenomenal--they came in on budget, three weeks ahead of schedule, and everything was of the finest quality.

5,Sam team are incredible! Don't bother looking anywhere else. They are worth every penny and they do a fantastic job.

We have very high expectations and they always meet them.

I will definitely work with them again."

He made sure to never to make us feel rushed or pressured into buying anything. From when the job started to when it finished everything that Davidsaid would be done was done.

We were so impressed with their attention to detail, and how well organized the construction company runs. The entire project was handled professionally and the final result was a reflection of our taste. Our kitchen and bathroom remodel came out better than we expected. During the work that they did at my house, I could see that they are detail oriented, hardworking and skilled. They did the work remarkably beautiful. My old kitchen was demolished completely and they installed new plumbing, cabinets, lightings and appliances while in the bathroom they replaced the tub and shower while installing new floor, hardware and vanity with double sink. During the work, I noticed that Daniel was very honest and fair with me while having excellent communication skills as well. I didn't experienced any hidden charges or additional extras. With my past experience it was hard to find a team who knows their work so well and that honesty is their main factor. I would definitely work with them again!!!"
5,"After three weeks, just got started. I'll let you know. I will update the rating when the work is completed.  While I would have liked to have more work done, the work Micky did was more than I thought was possible, on my budget. He was always very professional and kept me up to date. I don't know if it was the time of year that delayed the work, but I'm very happy with the end results."
4,"After interviewing several contractors, we hired AHI to remodel our master bathroom, guest bathroom, and laundry room. Within hours of initially contacting them, AHI sent a project manager, Neev, to our house to generate a quote. From the outset, Neev was detail oriented, picked up on issues that other contractors had missed, and sat down with us to generate a quote on-site. AHI’s quote was comparable to other bids, so we ultimately chose them for the project because they seemed the most service-oriented and capable of delivering what we wanted. I’m glad we did.

Neev was very responsive, communicative, and organized throughout the project. He helped us work through a couple of issues that arose in renovating a 100-year old house without nickel-and-diming us.  His foreman, Tal, was very hands-on and helped us settle some design issues, and the entire crew was polite and respectful of our home. Despite some setbacks, the team finished on time and we are thrilled with the work."
5,Shawn was wonderful. He came out same day for a quote and was available soon after for another project. He was respectful and great at communicating the steps along the way. It was better than I could imagine! Thanks!

5,"I only have the highest praises for Neev, his company and his work. From the beginning, Neev displayed so much warmth and sincerity towards us. From the first consultation, he gave tremendous time and detail to what we could anticipate if we were to hire him for our project, a full bathroom remodel. He was never in a rush, so open to conversation, and actively listened to what our expectations were for our project. Neev always carried himself with utmost professionalism, while establishing and maintaining a personal relationship, with constant, open and timely communication. The entire process was incredibly smooth. Neev gave us direction each step of the way, allowing us to choose our style and shop within our budget. Everything was done is a timely fashion and the project was finished so quickly! Every person involved in the project was professional, and we did not feel that our privacy was invaded at any point. We could not be happier with the final result of the bathroom. We would recommend Neev to anyone looking to do any remodeling or reconstruction, and would definitely work with him in the future! Thank you Neev!"
5,The installers were very professional and polite. My home looks brand new and definitely added to the total value. I would recommend them for any home owner. I love the way the they designed.
5,American Home Improvement just finished a painting job for me and they were great.  It was a difficult job with a lot of detail work on an old building and they stayed until it was perfect.  Everything was checked over by someone with an eye for detail and it passed with flying colors. I would definitely American Home Improvement.
5,"We chose American Home Improvement  for a large kitchen and bathroom project that took 2+ months. It was a fantastic decision because the crew treated us like family, were incredibly communicative, and professional, kind and did a fantastic job. Even when they did the initial demolition, they left our house swept and ready for us to walk through. It's a best case scenario for having contractors in your house everyday. When it comes to design they are fantastic, and helped us make decisions that really improved the look and feel of our space. We couldn't be happier with the final outcome!"
5,"We were very pleased with American Home Improvement Inc!  Our home needed foundation repair along the entire front of the house as well as replacement of the entry stairs which also meant rebuilding a portion of exterior wall and re stucco.  Benjamin was easy to deal with and did exactly what he said he would do.  The contract and payment schedule was clearly spelled out.  They started the job when they said, his workers showed up every day on time, cleaned up after themselves every day and they finished within a day or so of scheduled completion.  I was extremely impressed with how efficient and how well-calculated they were with their time and scheduling. They were attentive to our needs and always followed up with to make sure that we were happy.I would recommend to everyone."
5,"Excellent work, completed ahead of time and was very competitively priced. They did a major repair on our kitchen & bathroom. Two walls taken down, a window put in, plus a lot of other work on the house, including electrical, moving a gas line, and redoing floors.  I recommend American Home Improvement without hesitation."
5,"Benjamin and his team exceeded our expectations for our renovation. Our home had lots of challenges that other contractors couldn't overcome! Benjamin and his team not only figured out how to work out the challenges, but transformed our home into a beautiful place. We are so grateful for their attention to detail and design. Thank you American Home Improvement Inc and Benjamin  
for a great experience."
5,"Thanks to American Home Improvement Inc for our amazing kitchen! In addition to our kitchen, they also performed painting, plumbing, and some general contractor work all at a reasonable price. My husband and I found them very easy to work with and very professional. We would recommend them to anyone looking to have their kitchen or bath remodeled."
5,"I needed to add a shower in my parents room and David and his crew came through.  David listened intently to my parents needs and offered creative and practical solutions to the limited space available.  For the shower addition, he was able to skillfully make it so one could roll a wheelchair right in, with no step at all.  A slight slope was made for wheelchair access and water drainage. David offered to assist me in choosing tile, fixtures, and grab bars for my parents.  They look beautiful.  He had to deal with many different personalities at my parents home and he was patient and professional through the whole job.  His crew was always prompt, friendly and cleaned up after themselves. He finished the job in just a few weeks. My parents are so happy with the finished project.  We would definitely use him again."
5,"Very pleased with our bathroom remodel!  They have done the job in no time, with careful cleanup when they were done. Installation then went forward with no delays, no waiting for materials or available crew. Nick helped with selection of beautifully coordinated tile, which was installed with meticulous attention to detail.  Excellent communications and supervision throughout the whole project.  And the price was reasonable.  We would hire them again for our future need and highly recommended Nick and AHM for your next construction!!"
5,Shawn and his guys did a unbelievable job on my bathroom. My bathroom was all were old tile from the 80's with a leaking shower. Now we have white marble with amazing borders. When I was searching for company's all the construction company's I contacted gave me a horrible vibe from the start. I decided to invite 2 contractors to my house and Shawn was one of them. He suggested different options on expanding my bathroom and changing the layout at an affordable price. I felt very comfortable with him and his crew during the job and feel very confident with the quality after. The premises was kept clean during the job which was agreed upon in our original meeting and the job was completed on a timely manner. I had mentioned to Shawn I've always wanted a rain shower so he decided it was a good idea to surprise me with one as we did not agree to it on the original contract. I owe it to this company for such professional and quality work. I recommend Shawn and his crew for any of your remodeling and/or construction projects.
5,"I will hire this company again. They did work for both my neighbors and they referred me them. They did my exterior painting, windows, bathroom vanity and tile. The job exceeded my expectation and the time of work was 2 weeks from start to end. I will be calling this company again"
5,I recently contacted 1oak remodeling through a friend as she just remodeled her kitchen. I also just went through a big renovation and was not in the mood for another one although I urgently needed to repair my driveway and landscape the front of my home. They set an appointment with me and guided me through all the steps and procedures. My job finished in 1 week!!! They had a full crew working everyday to make my dreams come true. This company is really 1 of a kind! Thank you for all your help!!
5,"Shawn from AHI did an excellent job.  I recently hired them to remodel my 80 year old Mother's bathroom.  My intention was to accommodate handicapped accessible usage to an older home.  Most contractors that I contacted prior to the remodel wanted to sell an elaborate over the top remodel to a room that I had already laid out with my ideas and intentions.  Those contractors that came out, came as a team and wanted to sign a on the spot 1 day only sale price, otherwise the price would go up.  After contacting them, I was listened to, told them what I wanted and they proposed a reasonable solution.  There was no pressure or ""sales"" attack.  Having dreaded doing a job like this while meeting with several shady contractors, I was pleasantly surprised with the fact that they took care of everything.  No surprises or additional charges, etc.  Just a competent, professional and thorough job from a very happy customer.  I would highly recommend Shawn and American Home Improvement your remodeling needs."
5,I awarded American Home Improvement Inc my Wiltshire home renovation and am very pleased with their service. Very clean crew and they are perfectionists!!! Love their work and their collaboration with my Designer. Thank you Jose!
5,"American Home Improvement in Los Angeles! They understands quality and good building practices. From start to finish their attention to detail is excellent. The work site is always well organized and clean. Michael did an outstanding job overseeing the construction project. I had a room addition built and completely renovated my entire house, including remodeling my kitchen and all four bathrooms. All of the workers were friendly and fantastic at their specific trade. They were easy to communicate with and made an effort to keep the site safe (I have a toddler). They came out, was very nice and Michael and his team was able to complete the remodeling in less than a month. All the materials were selected from his vendors and Michael was able to get us a nice discount. During the whole remodeling, Michael visited us often and informed us about the progress and any problem that came up and what solution can solve it. His honesty and professionalism proved itself during this work and we are thankful for that. I would recommend this contractor to anyone that values quality and detailed work!!!"
5,"I hired American Home Improvement Inc for a whole house remodel. We pretty much broke down all interior and exterior walls and reconfigured walls to create an open floor plan. I believe they have before and after photos on their profile, not sure if the photos are up yet but boy was it a transformation! Throughout the process, I learned so much about construction. Never realized how many tedious decisions are needed in order to remodel a house, starting with kitchen cabinets, counter tops, blinds, color of paint, floors, on and on and on. Overall it was a great project, and I would hire these guys to work for me again in a heartbeat. Most important thing to me is being able to stay true to my preset budget."

5,"Their crew is amazing. They did my kitchen and bathroom, and I couldn't have been happier with their job. They were very nice and friendly, they kept the workspace clean and organized which helped everyone in that situation move around the house with more comfort. They know how to make their customers happy and provide good servicing with their tools. Working with them has been awesome for me so I'll recommend them to anyone needing a remodeling."
5,I called them in for my home renovation and they sent someone to check things and give an estimate . The think i was more concerned about is if I would get the kind of look i want from them.

Their service is very good.I will definitely call American Home Improvement Inc if i want another redesign.

The contract was specific, the company had a payment schedule and they even helped me finance the project. The kitchen is just perfect for my baking needs now.

Only set back was that there was a door that was accidentally scratched when the counter tops where being installed but they fixed the door a few days later. My sister is hiring them also for her bathroom and I hope she has just the same experience as I did."
5,"Working with Shawn was great, after visiting their location and meeting the staff I felt very comfortable with my decision to remodel.

I can say in confidence that I can totally recommend them for either small or big jobs.  The crew were very professional, and on top of their work and especially their prices are very compatible.  They went above and beyond what they promise!"
5,"I can only say that American Home Improvement has been the greatest company in the field of construction in terms of no hassle. I appreciated everything about working with them. It was easy reaching out to them and speaking with a representative about my plans and estimates. The inspection where we over my remodel in detail and decided on a price was a friendly affair (considering the fairness of the price). Lastly, the project itself was finished one week ahead of schedule, and it was done beautifully! My family and I could not be happier with our new living room and kitchen."

5,"We replaced all cabinetry, tile and fixtures for the entire bathroom including moving the tub and creating a new shower area. We had a leak under the previous cabinetry so there were also remediation work and lots of demo leading into the project. We hired them mainly because, unlike other contractors, they were full-service from the design end. Their mobile showroom really helps you make decisions, even on the minor details, and Eli helped us get ideas and ensure that our design choices would work together (for example making sure that all the plumbing fixtures were compatible). We also requested some unique features (like a rock river effect in the tile/grout leading from the shower to the bathroom door) that we had an idea for that resulted in a solution they helped design. The team was professional throughout and clearly worked together well. Work was done on time and within budget. The cleaning crew they had come in at the end was world class as well."
5,"This was the most amazing experience remodeling a kitchen that I think you could ask for!  Neev was incredible with the timeline, what to expect, when to expect it and even completed the project early!

The work is impeccable, I could always reach Neev and he was always willing to work with me or explain if I didn't understand what was happening next.  The best experience!"

I would recommend this company to others planning a home renovation."
5,"I’m not one to typically post a review, but after our recent experience with American Home Improvement and specifically our project manager Neev Kugel, I felt obliged to comment on their phenomenal work.  We contracted them to remodel our kitchen as well as re-do the flooring in adjacent rooms and other related improvements.  I was extremely impressed by how professional Neev and the whole operation was from start to finish.  Outside of knowing we wanted to update our kitchen, my wife and I really didn’t have a clear vision on exactly how we wanted it to look.  We essentially put our faith and trust in Neev to deliver an end product that we would love and he didn’t disappoint.  At the start of the project, Neev brought in designers who were very knowledgeable, creative and receptive to our ideas to help create a contemporary and elegant design that both my wife and I loved.  From there, Neev developed the project plan and timeline that was consistent with the original estimate.  
Throughout the entire process, Neev was very communicative and would always clearly outline next steps so we knew what to expect.  This made the process much smoother and reduced the typical frustration that can come with remodels because we always knew the status of the work.  

Now this is not to say the project was completed without any snags.  As with any project, there were surprises that came up.  However, Neev always worked with us to explain the issue, outline our options, and would work with us to make sure we were happy with the final outcome. All of the workers brought into our home showed the same level of professionalism and quality craftsmanship.  Most importantly, the final outcome of the remodel was outstanding.  Not only was everything completed on-time and on-budget, but it turned out absolutely stunning exceeding our expectations.  And as the say, the devil is in the details, and it was the details where the quality of the work came through.  It was clear that they do not cut corners.  The quality of the work was beyond reproach.  

In terms of price, we didn’t do much comparison shopping before going with AHI.  Neev impressed us when we initially brought him in so we didn’t get other bids for the project.  I can say anecdotally the price was very comparable to what some of our other friends paid for similar work.  And most importantly the price originally agreed to is was we ultimately paid, which is very important to me.  No bait and switch.   

All in all, I would highly recommend Neev and AHI if considering a home improvement project."
5,Excellent home remodeling company. They recently remodeled our kitchen and we really are very satisfied with the outcome. Eli was our project manager and he was very helpful. He also resolved some issued and made a project very simple although it wasn't at all. They finished the kitchen within promised time and we are very impressed with their quality of work. Thank you American Home Improvement!
5,"American Home Improvement just completed our bathroom and patio remodel and we could not be happier. Neev Kugel was our project manager and he is an absolute gem. He made sure that we were informed every step of the way what to expect for the weekly schedule and always knew who was coming and going. His communication was excellent. He always got back to me, no matter how trivial my question or concern might have been.  As this was our first remodel, Neev helped us design, select and accent our remodel by leading us in the right direction. We absolutely love our tile and Neev provided a specific shopping list that allowed us autonomy to select our own designs, while helping us avoid unnecessary expenses. 

The crew of artisans Neev brought in to do the work were amazing. From the demolition crew to the tile guys, they were all professional and clean. They arrived on time and were courteous and helpful. They went out of their way to be sure we were happy with the results and had us view everything as it was completed to be sure we were satisfied. Anything that needed to be addressed was handled right away and to our complete satisfaction. 

As I said in the beginning, we could not be happier with the whole experience. Neev and his crew turned an old, outdated bathroom in to a serene and relaxing place to be. It turned out exactly as I wanted, as Neev understood my vision and guided us in the right direction. We would not have what we do today were it not for him."
5,"I can only say positive things about my experience with American Home Improvement. My remodel was performed above my expectations by a very qualified and talented design and remodeling team.

5,"American Home Improvement has been phenomenal to work with. They lay out what your project will consist of at the start, so there are no surprises when the project is taking place. Their designers are skilled and experienced and also patient enough to listen to the input of the customer.

They ended up finalizing the kitchen remodel in just 3 weeks as we agreed on. This was an above average remodeling experience that consisted of everything I recommend others look for when doing business with a contractor. Transparency, professionalism, and timeliness."
5,"I had many issues with my roof if recent time and I thought it was time to replace it. I already worked with American Home Improvement so I called them to send someone to inspect my roof. They agreed it was time to replace it and gave me several solutions. I accepted one of them and they were available soon. The crew came early in the morning on scheduled time, they worked hard and they were very quick because they are so well organized. The installation went OK, there were some issues but it was resolved easily. My new roof looks amazing thanks to American Home Improvement!!"

5,"American Home Improvement has done their part throughout this bathroom remodeling project. I never felt like I needed to chase them down to get my questions answered or to fulfill their general timeline for completion. 

Everything in the project was fluent, down to the expectations that were established by everyone involved. Designers, managers, owners, etc. Everyone fulfilled their roles in a professional manner and that’s why our bathroom has the marble finish we’ve always yearned for.

Best,
Maura"

5,Great results for good price! Ziv form American Home Improvement did an excellent job at my house by remodeling the 2 bathrooms at my house. The first bathroom was the master and the second one was the half bathroom. His work and price included all the materials and labor too. He made sure to understand what I would like to get and how much I want to spend. I do recommend him and his workers for any home remodeling project.
5,"We start remodeling our kitchen with another contractor that was not able to finish it and we had a problem. We came across several companies including American Home Improvement and due to the situation, we hired them to finish what the other one couldn't do. Our kitchen was at early stage of the remodeling and lucky for us, the cabinets were in our garage waiting to be installed. Jason from American Home Improvement, came over and promised us that he will be able to help us and to complete this kitchen. The day after, he sent some of his workers to start the work and to have it finished ASAP. It took them a week and a half to finish this mess and we are thankful for him and his team for that. The price in total was a little bit high, but we have a kitchen now and this is priceless. They were able to finish the cabinets, counter tops, the paint and the installation of the lights and switches."
5,"American Home Improvement remodeled our bathroom. Eli, our project manager made the entire experience excellent.

Mark and his people were able to finish the new kitchen in less than a month and the new kitchen came out the way we wanted and even more.

The remodeling project that she did for us was to replace the entire roof at our house and then to remodel completely the kitchen and master bathroom. Tammy worked on the 3 sections of the house at the same time with several team of people that each one was a professional one at his trades. The old roof was an old one and once the old roof was removed, the roofing team started to install the new one under the supervision of Tammy. Inside the house, we had another team of people that worked on the kitchen and master bathroom. At the end of the kitchen demolition, Tammy noticed a large mold behind the sink cabinets. Tammy was able to immediately inspect it and she provided us with an advice on what to do. As soon as that problem was solved, the rest of the remodeling project went very smoothly and without any issues.

We look forward to starting our next remodeling project with them (which will be our master bathroom remodeling). American home improvement earned our highest recommendation!"
5,"I was loking for company to remodel our bathroom. I send several quotes and only American Home Improvement answered same day, but I waited other contractors to answer and project offer from this company was just much better than from others. When they started working first day it was obvious that they are trully professionals and I was so relaxed because I knew it thay will do excellent work. The project was finished in 5 weeks and the final bill was within budget. The kitchen looks very nice, great work guys, thanks!"

5,"We met with few construction companies in order to remodel our kitchen and all the bathrooms at the house which at the end of all the meetings… we decided to hire American Home Improvement. We met with Mickey and during all the meetings that we had, he spend extra time to really understand what we want to achieve, what is our style and preferred design. This was a huge plus for us because we felt that he really care about our project and not only in making money. We needed to expand and upgrade our kitchen by moving the laundry space to the garage and removing a wall between the dining room area to the kitchen. This made us the exact open space and entertaining area that we wanted. More than that, we replaced some of the windows so we can have natural light. In the kitchen we added an island with 6 seating that will face one of the windows overlooking the back yard. The team of Mickey guided us to make the remodeling stress free including helping us with the purchase of all the cabinets, floors, marble, tiles and appliances. We are very happy with the whole remodeling and the new kitchen beat all of our prospects, converting our entire home. We will keep recommending Mickey and American Home Improvement."

5,"I only can say this contractor is great. We needed to remodel our kitchen and I was very patient in searching good contractor for that because I didn't have good experience with contractors in past. From reviews on internet American Home Improvement seemed to be excellent company so I contacted them. They respond to my quote immediately and I was satisfied with their offer, it wasn't lowest price but it was high quality project so we made a contract. They were available soon after that, next week so we started remodeling. The workers came in scheduled time every day and were very professional, quick and accurate. They finished kitchen in 6 weeks and the price was same as estimate. I didn't expected that because they were some issues which they resolved with success. The kitchen looks beautiful, my wife love it and that is most important!"

Eddie was always there when needed, answered all our question, gave us some good ideas and resolved some issues.

We are very satisfied with garage and basement and will highly recommend American Home Improvement to friends, family, neighbors"
5,This is my second remodeling and first time I wasn't completely satisfied so this time I decided to pick up carefully right contractor for my kitchen remodel. I contacted 5 or 6 contractors and deccided to give job to American Home Improvement because their project was closest to my ideal kitchen. When they started work they were very professional and kept eye on details and always updated with new info about work progress. The work was done 2 days before they said It will be done and within budget. The kitchen looks better than I expected and I will definitelly recommend American Home Improvement.
5,I was provided with excellent immediate service from the call I placed to the very end of the work. I first dealt with David and he was very informative. He sent Shawn & right away I was comfortable and confident that this was the company for me. The workers were polite & professional and did an amazing job. Will definitely use them again for my future projects. Thank you American Home Improvement
5,I recently hired American Home Improvement for my kitchen remodel. The American Home Improvement staff treated me as if I was their most important client and their whole team pitched in to help when needed.

5,"merican Home Improvement did complete makeover of my garage.Shawn did great job, he was very helpful and very carefull to make sure everything will fit perfectly.

5,The American Home improvement was one of 4 other contractors we've contacted and by far they were the most competitive. They did absolutely amazing work. The whole American Home Improvement team were professional and easy to work with. They installed laminate in our two rooms and they looks so much better now. I highly recommend anyone looking for a home remodel to contact them first.
1,"Do not trust this company.  The project started out well but quickly became a nightmare. This large company hires out contractors to get work and doesn't seem to check these contractors experience.  The guy that I learned later was a great salesman, but didn't know how to create a simple footing.  I had to correct his formwork! Then after he promised to prove himself, he failed again and the rebar was all wrong.
 I asked AHI for a new contractor.  They agreed and would keep promising to fix the same issue. 4 different people were sent out over 3 weeks and each one didn't speak to the previous one and knew nothing about the project. They all agreed that the work by the first contractor was not correct, but each crew also contradicted each other. It's like they didn't even know who came out before and I would have to explain what is going on.
 AHI would promise again and again to correct the issue and each time they failed. I have worked in the construction industry on large and small projects for over 10+ years.  I have never experienced any company with such a lack of communication and incompetence.  DO NOT HIRE AHI."
5,"WONDERFUL KITCHEN REMODEL  AHI is an excellent company that strives to fully satisfy. Met with Eli and unlike other companies, AHI was the only company that truly listened to my desires and made sure to explain all possible options and limitations that could lie ahead. They have a trustworthy, courteous and hardworking group of craftsman. Eli was there throughout the job progress. The end was everything and more than I was hoping for. While they were not the cheapest price wise - although was very reasonable, the cost is worth it in the end. You made my family very happy and proud of our new kitchen. Thank you!"
5,"Thank God for a great company. Nick came out & they did a complete redesign/renovation of our home (aprox 3000 sq ft.). Amazing attention to detail and incredibly responsive. Aside from a couple of minor hiccups (all projects of this scale will have some), they far exceeded all of our expectations and would immediately turn to them if we were to have any additional renovation needs. These guys are full service -- from creating the design to following through in making it exactly as it was planned. Everyone at this company, from the person answering the phone to the owners care and work hard to make one's renovations go smoothly."
5,"My new kitchen was remodeled and supervised by American home improvement under Elad. Elad designed and implemented the kitchen by generating a 3D design for the kitchen, providing me with several options of styles, colors and appliances. After several meetings that I had with him, I was able to come up with a design and style that I liked and Elad took care of the rest. My remodeling was hassle free because Elad was able to place the orders, making sure that everything will be delivered to my house so the remodeling will not be delayed or effected by missing any of the items/materials. Elad was nice to me and he always answered my calls or returned them within a reasonable time period. I highly recommend this company. The new kitchen came out excellent and exactly the way it should be."
5,"We truly love American home improvement! We had a wonderful time during the remodeling work that they did at our house and we highly recommend this company! Mark was able to deliver everything he promise and even more. We originally hired them to completely redo the kitchen and bathroom on top of few other tasks around the house. One of our friend is an interior designer by profession and she joined us and helped on the design of our new stunning kitchen, brand new cabinets, new hardware, paint, counter tops and more. Mark and his team were able to join forces very well with her and we were happy by that because it saved us money. In the master bedroom and bathroom we removed the existing tub and installed new hot tub including the replacement of all the existing floors and walls in addition to replacing all the light fixtures and the vanity mirrors. We fell that we are very blessed by having American home improvement and that the remodeling project was completed right before the holidays. We are currently thinking of doing another project and of course we will hire American home improvement! We are very satisfied with all the people at American home improvement that were involved at our house project that we invited all of them for a BBQ after the job was done."
5,"American home improvement remodeled completely our kitchen and laundry room and it came out gorgeously. We found American home improvement through online website. We wanted to upgrade and renew the kitchen we had because it was old style and needed to be more functional so we used American home improvement for that and the kitchen is now more than what we wanted. We are very fascinated with the precision of the cabinets, countertops and paint (on top of the other parts of the work). Isaac made sure that everything will be without any mistake or error. They were very professional & hardworking people. All the communication could not been better between us to Isaac to the labor crew. The overall experience in this project was great and pleasant. Isaac was the best project manager. He kept us in the constant loop and made sure that all of our concerns will be addressed. Very detailed oriented and high communication skills person. We definitely consider working again with Isaac & American home improvement!"
5,"We hired American home improvement for our entire house remodeling. We recently purchased this house and it was in an immediate updates. Our supervisor was Isaac which during the whole work was very reliable, hardworking person, always available, quickly respond our calls or messages. Like any other remodeling project, we came across several problems which we thought will increase the overall budget BUT Isaac took care of them right away. His team, were all wonderful and we have no complain against any of them! They worked hard and fast while making sure that everything works and come out great. We truly know that other contractors (in case we hired them for that job) might do it cheaper, but the quality of the work that Isaac did – can’t be compared at all. Now our house is back to life and looks brand new. Thank you Isaac and the wonderful team!"
5,"I hired American Home Improvement for the remodeling project of my master closet, master bathroom and mainly the kitchen. I had my vision of how I want them to be done and more than that, I was able to design my drawings of the spaces and I just needed someone reliable that can make it happen. I spoke to few contractors and met with them too. One of them was Mickey. Mickey was very nice, professional and skilled contractor when we met and he captured my attention compare to the other ones. The remodeling supposed to be finish within a month of work but due to several changes that we did during the work, it ended up that the remodeling took a little longer than it should but at the end…. I can say clearly that it was well worth it! I must mention also, that Mickey didn’t charge me anything more what we agreed on and he was very fair and honest while the quality of the work and the customer service was beyond compare."
5,"American home improvement has completed several projects in our house including the remodeling of our guest bathroom, master bathroom, kitchen and living room area. The design and remodeling was a custom European style/modern while the bathroom included a walk in tile shower, jet shower system, home automation and more… part of the design was to reposition the door opening for a much better use of space. American home improvement staff helped us by selecting all of the finish materials including the tiles, upper and lower cabinets, accessories and more… including the color/style of the paint. David included also in his work the remodeling of the guest bathroom, drywall, type of texture, baseboards etc. He has excellent, professional craftsmanship and creativity skills. American home improvements approach and talent to meet our deadlines were fantastic and he was able to finish the remodeling project on time. We definitely recommend American home improvement and all the involved people that worked at our house for any type or style of construction or remodeling projects. We are very pleased with the completed project and we will hire them again for more upcoming projects. Thanks American home improvement for a great job from a very happy customer."
5,"American Home Improvement and our project manager, Elad, have done a gorgeous remodeling job on our open space concept kitchen remodeling. We must admit that we are not easy clients! As part of our remodeling project, we removed several load bearing walls and installed new beams within the ceiling, poured concrete footings under the house, installed new hardwood floors from the living room into the kitchen and matched the drywall on the walls and ceiling in order to achieve a perfectly flat client and everything went smoothly. During the work, we lived at the house and the workers sealed off all the spaces that were not part of the work so the dust that we were so concerned of… was kept to minimum. Elad also made sure to stick to the main budget and the promised timeline (which was very important to us). We were warned by some friends that these days it’s very hard to find a good company that will provide the same service as we got from American Home Improvement! We are looking forward to hire them for additional projects in the future!"
5,"We had several meetings with Shean from American home improvement regarding to the kitchen that we want to remodel and what is our vision and goals. After he heard our thoughts, requests and fears, he came up with an incredible, open space kitchen and dining room area that came out much more stunning than we imagined. Not only does our new space look spectacular, it’s unique and very functional. Remarkably, Shean and all the people that were involved in our remodeling project, were professionals, hard-working people who really showed us that they care and treated it like it was their own home. The general attitude of American home improvement’s was very positive and impressive this is the main reason why we are writing this review and we highly recommend them."
5,"If we summarized our remodeling project, we will say that Daniel is the person that you will want to manage your remodeling project!!!!! we can’t write enough about his personality and working crew. They are all absolute professionals. Everything was performed within the time frame we agreed on and with the highest remodeling standards. Our brand new kitchen looks perfect! The crew was very polite, skilled and worked very hard to get the remodeling project done to our satisfaction. Daniel was in contact with all the relevant updates regards the remodeling and he was there for us most of the time to answer any questions we had. His ideas really made a huge impact in the way the kitchen came out. His skills and vision made this work so easy. The new kitchen is now the main place where we usually spend most of our time. We couldn’t be happier and pleased. We currently have more plans on remodeling additional sections at the house and we won’t call anyone else – that’s for sure."
5,"We hired Shean and his professional workers to remodel our master bathroom. The complete preparation of the bathroom space was great, easy and they made sure to cover everything to prevent all the dust to come out and make a mess. The old bathroom was taken down all the way to the studs while right after that, they took care of replacing all the plumbing and electrical so they will be replaced with new ones and being upgraded. The inside walls were replaced as well, new tile floor have been installed and the bathroom got new fresh paint. After all of that was completed, Shean start to install the new tub, and then the floor was grouted and polished. The double sink vanity and all the relevant hardware such as sinks, faucets, handles etc.… were installed as well including all the baseboards. I must mention that their skills, involvement, approach and ability to achieve the goals & stay within the budgets while working with other sub-contractors was outstanding. The finished project is beautiful and perfect. We would highly recommend this company, as well as Shean and his crew."
5,"I hired American home improvement to re-do my entire house that I recently purchased and planned to live in. I hired American home improvement to design and implement the construction of the Kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, hallways, front yard and back yard. Shean was the main people that I worked with and after several meetings and conversations about what I want to get, they were able to come up with the draft design that included everything I wanted and it fit my style and budget. The draft design was polished and finalized and I gave the approval for the work to start. They were very flex with the entire remodeling project and they even did several changes that came up during the work and they didn’t charge me for them. Any bump that appeared during the construction, the entire team was on top of it and they were able to find the right solution that worked out very well and they took the required measures to remedy the situation to my satisfaction. The team including Shean was very responsive to any of my phone calls, e-mails and even text messages and the working crew were skilled and courteous. I would recommend them to anyone!"
5,"""Exceptional, skilled, superb craftsmanship"" are just the little good words that we can write here that can define our experience with American home improvement. Right after we interviewed 4 other construction companies, we knew that Adam was the only one that we should hire to remodel our two bathrooms and kitchen. Adam was honest with us from the beginning, proved to be truly hardworking, on time and that his main focus was to leave this remodeling project within our budget. His whole working crew was clean and very skilled as well. Adam was in constant communication with us during the whole remodeling process and he kept up in the loop in regards to anything that was involved with the work. Adam made sure to visit our house daily while making sure that he is satisfied with the progress and mainly that we love the work that they do. Their final work shows how we were correct about hiring them for our house and it came out so beautiful and mainly functional. We highly recommend American home improvement!"
5,"American home improvement was recommended to us by one of our close friends, the American home improvement team were very skilled and hardworking people. Daniel is a skilled contractor and designer who give 100% of himself in order to achieve the very best of work. Our project included the kitchen and master bedroom and bathroom and was managed by Daniel while executing by his team. The entire remodeling is a huge success and we are very happy with the results of how it came out. Each time we walk and use our new kitchen, we totally amazed and happy. The same feeling we have for the rest of the remodeling as well. Everything in the work including the painting, new insulation, woodworking, cabinets etc… are in perfect final results. In regards to the communication and reports – Daniel made sure to keep us in the loop in regards to anything involved with the work. We are very happy."
5,"Over the years, our house has suffered from some abuse from our kids and dogs. It was about time to do some upgrades and renovations to bring new life to the house. We wanted to do a complete remodeling and we start our searching for a designer and home improvement contractor. Our search brought us to American home improvement and we made an appointment with Or for an in house consultation. Almost right away we knew that he will be the one that will do the work. He spent with us over 3 hours browsing our house and asking many questions about what we were looking for to get in the remodeling. At the first meeting he came up with great ideas and few solutions as how to transform our home into a gorgeous and functional place to live. After several meetings with Or and his designer, our process of remodeling started. All our neighbors said how courteous & considerate the people at American home improvement were. We could see how the American home improvement crew were skilled and exhibited a great sense of craftsmanship and attention to details. It was clear how they took pride in what they were building. Or is not only extremely creative and skilled… but very detail oriented person and he asked the same from his people. Both Or and his crew delivered much more than they promised. If something was not 100% good, Or had it redone. He went above and beyond his words to make sure we were happy. The final results are a gorgeous statement of pride, craftsmanship and promises kept. We will continue to recommend American home improvement to anyone who asks. Thank you Or and your team too. If ever we need to do this again it would be our pleasure to have American home improvement."
5,"The guys at American home improvement were wonderful, we got from them the best deal for our remodeling project and we are very happy with how it came out. We wanted to be to remove two walls that we had in the middle of the room. After we got several estimates from 4 other companies, we decided to reject all of them for various reasons and to hire American home improvement for it. Sam came over to our house several times before the work was even started. He wanted to make sure that the design will represent exactly what we wanted to have and more than that, was the price. After we loved the design and the price, Sam started the work and it went very smoothly and without any problem. Sofia at the office, made sure that all the required paperwork will be done correctly and that we won’t have any delay with the progress. We truly love the new kitchen that Sam did for us and we highly recommend them to anyone."
5,"American home improvement did several sections at my house including the remodeling of my master bathroom, 2 Additional bathrooms and paint the entire house. The whole work turned out to an amazin results. Or was the main person that I dealt with and he was amazingly easy person to work with. His in-house designer made so many great design solutions and ideas while placing all of my needs and vision into the final budget. The entire work was done by skilled and professional people who made extra attention on cleaning and productivity. During the work, there was never a mess and each day and before everyone left for the day, the workers made sure to dedicate and hour or so for organize the working space and the following morning when they came to work, they will set up tarps and covers on all the floors and areas. The bathrooms were a complete remodeling tasks where they removed everything and rebuild it based on the new design. The new design gave us a huge shower space (after removing the bath tub) with glass enclosure, a normal size bench and awesome floors and walls tile work. I’m very happy with the work and would recommend them for any remodeling project."
5,"I called American home improvement after my massive research about their services and I was very pleased with what I read and saw. After I spoke to the representative, I asked them to schedule an appointment with and to discuss my project and to see what I can do. To my house arrived Shean and went over me about the kitchen and living room remodeling project and after 2 additional meetings, the work started. I will not go into all the micro details here, but I was very happy and surprised with the quality of the work and mainly how they managed everything. American home improvement are by far the most professional company I have ever got involved with and it was clear during each and every stage of the way. I do recommend them for any type of remodeling project such as upgrading, new construction or any other type of construction work."
5,"We wanted to remodel our Kitchen completely on top of the remodeling of the main floor (paint and new floor). One family member of us recommended that we should talk to Ziv at American home improvement before making any decision with the other contractors. After speaking with Ziv, it was pretty clear to us that we should hire them for that work and to leave the other contractors. Ziv gave us a perfect direction and ideas about the remodeling and we were very happy with that because we knew that this is what we need and want. Ziv and his team were extremely detailed oriented people and they surpassed all the anticipations with the finished kitchen. Each day we saw how our remodeling project is moving forward and how friendly and hardworking people the team were. Unlike past experiences… We didn’t have to worry if the workers will show up each morning to work. The American home improvement working people were on top of our remodeling project and we can’t thank them enough. We do recommend them!!!"
5,"I hired American home improvement to finally bring the backyard of my house to life. The empty lot in the back yard was the same way I got it when I purchased the new house from the builder and all it had was just dirt. This project was pretty challenging because of the semi small space, shaped and slightly irregular. American home improvement was able to provide me with several estimates and options and all of this in order to help me get the ‘feeling’ of prices based on several levels of items and quality in hard-scape, soft-scape and lighting. This method of service allowed me to make better choices on areas to enhance or compromise in order to stay within budget. My past experiences with landscapers was not good and it made it harder for me to make a decision in hiring anyone to this project. My past experience showed me that whoever you hire, they will be either good at one thing or not that good at the other one, rarely can you find someone that will be goo in both AND mostly they never finish anything when they say they're going to. My experience with American home improvement was completely different and positive. Ben was especially knowledgeable about both hard and soft-scape and provided intuitively good recommendations. Sure thing but like any job, there will always be few problems, but Ben was fair enough and responsive, working diligently to come to a resolution we were both happy with. I was most impressed with the professionalism and hardworking ethic of the actual crew that did the work. They arrived on time every day, were polite and cleaned up after themselves each day. They take pride in their work and it shows. American home improvement did such a good job. I will hire them again for any future landscaping needs."
5,"Based on several recommendations and help from friends about this company, I decided to go ahead and hire American home improvement to remodel my 2 bathrooms and kitchen. During each one of the steps in the remodIsaacng, Isaac (the owner) informed me and communicate with me about what is happening , what is going to happened and he always responded to my emails, calls or even texts and my feedback about some of the things that the workers did that day or about to do. The teams at American home improvement that worked at my house, did a great job as well and they put a lot of attention in order to make everything in perfect condition and without mistakes, thanks to Juan and all of the others.  Even when there were issues or concerns from my end, Isaac and the workers were always willing to make it right or to explain to me why it needed to be that way. Isaac and Jacob (his partner) were very helpful and have even provided advice and assistance on other construction issues unrelated to their work. I would not hesitate to recommend American home improvement for any large construction jobs and will definitely be using them again whenever I have another project."
5,Finding a contractor for me was the most stressful part of the remodeling. I have contacted a lot of companies knowing I will be investing on my savings. I can never seem to find a company I can trust & I just couldn’t click with their reps until I found American Home Improvement. My project manager asked the right questions & I felt that what really mattered was for me to get what I want for the price I can afford. He made sure we stay within the budget & what was more important was that he delivered from beginning to end. I was not disappointed at all. Highly recommend this company.
5,"My experience with AHI couldn’t be any better. With a little hesitation because of budget issues, I called this company from a local
Magazine for an estimate. I was very impressed how knowledgeable the project manager was. He gave me different options & ideas & helped me from A to Z get a loan with the terms I can be comfortable with to actually do the outdoor remodeling I’ve always wanted. Now I have a brand new patio & a backyard done very professionally. I am very pleased with my experience & will certainly call them for my next home project."
5,"My home is over 10 years old and we finally decided to do a kitchen update. I hired American home improvement to design and implement the new kitchen and make it practical for us. Isaac came up with a great design of the kitchen and he actually took the time to listen to us and to truly understand our needs. Isaac and his workers on top of his sub-contractors, worked together in a professional manner to deliver the kitchen I wanted and the result are wonderful. His crew were always on time and I was overwhelmed with the schedule and the daily tasks routine they had and mostly the cleaning at the end of each day. When the remodeling was completed, I noticed of several problems. I called Isaac at American home improvement and he came out right away and fixed them all. We are now thinking of hiring them again to remodel the bathrooms at our house."
5,"I highly recommend American home improvement to for any quality of home remodeling and dealing with creative, professionals and skilled people. I wanted add an additional space to my bedroom that will have a powder room and a larger bathroom in my house. I came to American home improvement with a global concept of what I wanted to achieve. Shlomo worked with me hand by hand to make the addition and to enlarge the bathroom and to recreate the closet space while remodeling the bathroom and powder room the way I wanted it to be. I trusted the working team from the very early stage of the work but the completed remodeling project is much more beautiful than what I had anticipated! Shlomo did a great work by redesigning and polished the original design (master bathroom and powder room) that feel large, relaxed and lovely. The crew that executed this remodeling was excellent as well. Even our guests and family stated on how enjoyable and trained they were! The work took a little longer than it should (which is normal to my opinion) but Shlomo communicated with me often and provided me with weekly updates and detailed explanations of the work progress and what left to be done. I am hoping to remodel the kitchen in the near future and I’m looking forward to hire American home improvement again."
5,"We had a great pleasure to hire and allow American home improvement to work at our house and Mae and the workers for the recent kitchen and guest bathroom remodeling. I write this review based on our experience only of hiring them. Mickey and Mae did a great job at the kitchen mainly and Mae made it go easy and smoothly. The main points according to our experience with them were:
1. Very well organized company and structured. The workers and Mickey showed up to the house each day during the week and they arrived on time and on the little times that they didn’t show up due to things such as deliveries etc.…  they always gave us notice ahead of time which was important. 
2. All the communication between the office (Mae), Mickey and the workers were excellent. They didn't make any mistakes and were able to do everything in good and professional manner. We expected to have some errors and delays but I we were just lucky and we didn’t have any. 
3. Price wise - They were a bit more expensive than the other bids we received but the effort and care they put into our project was well worth it. Sometimes you just have to go with your instinct and choosing with them was one of the best decisions we made."
5,"We got in touch with American home improvement about doing several things at our house. We wanted to have them paint the house, replace the windows with a double sided glass and add 2 patio doors that will give us a bigger opening space from the house to the back yard and to rebuilt the kitchen. We wanted to replace the faces of the kitchen cabinet doors and to give it a new look while keeping the existing layout of it. Isaac was able to provide us with the best deal and our research about the company gave us the final approve to hire them. While we worked on the kitchen with Isaac and his people, we decided to do additional things at the house that we thought it will be a good idea to do them while we do the kitchen project as well. The windows that we Isaac replace for us were a double glass windows with special film (UV film). In the patio, we wanted to have bigger opening that will allow us to be inside the house while getting the feeling of being outside. Isaac's people did a perfect job on that too. The last item that we did was to paint the house inside and also some touch ups outside. Isaac brought to the house several people that came over and worked area by area and making sure that we can live at the rest of the house. The work came out better than we thought and we are extremely pleased with our decision to hire American home improvement and mainly to work with Isaac."
5,"Many thanks to American Home Improvement and mainly Mark and the actual people that were involved in our remodeling, for the excellent remodeling job that they did at our house. The remodeling project included the full remodeling of our house and it included the kitchen. Bathrooms, back yard, front yard, bedrooms and hallways. The work changed completely the house and we love it very much! Mark and his crew did such a professional work and each part of it was done with extra care and attention. During the work and even after, Mark was there for us to answer any of our questions or concerns, meeting us at various vendors and helped us selecting and choosing all the materials, appliances and paint. He used his skills and experience to advise us on all the many available options for many issues that raised during the work! We would refer American Home Improvement to anyone looking to convert their house space into something stunning!"
5,"Shlomo did a wonderful job when we hired him and his people to renovate our house. We hired him to execute our designed plans that we did with another design firm. The design plans were to remodel our kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms, laundry room and living room on top of the dining room area as well. Shlomo at American Home Improvement and their several subcontractors that were hired for our remodeling in order to do the electricity, plumbing and custom kitchen cabinets, were able to bring the design to life with an amazing skills and special attention to all the small details which made this remodeling project a huge success and very beautiful. During the work, we noticed very clear how the working crew and the subcontractors were easygoing and skilled with several modifications that came up due to unknown problems that arises during the work and all of them were communicating with us when they happen. We look forward to working with them again in the future."
5,"We were having Shlomo working at our house for the remodeling project that we needed to do for a while now. He met and sat with us several times of different days planning and describing their process and services. Our remodeling project was to do a new kitchen, master bathroom, master bedroom walk-in closet and replacing the old HVAC system with new one. Shlomo and Ben managed our project together and they started with measuring the existing areas of the house which allow them to come up with a design a week after. Each detail of the project was analyzed and discussed to mainly cover the cost and time frame for each task such as: appliances, countertops, cabinet style and colors etc. and the time frame that required for installing the new HVAC system from their sub-contractor. While close to half of the house was under work, American home improvement took every protection they could to cover the rest of the house from the dust and debris so we can live at the house for the time been and they made us a temporary kitchen. Each detail and part of the remodeling was supervised by both of them. The working team were very professional and skilled, from the electrician, the plumber, tile man and the painter. They all worked flawlessly together and involved us with each step of the work. Each one of them took pride in his own trade which ended in a beautiful kitchen and bathrooms that we enjoy just by looking at them. American home improvement finished our remodeling project on time and a little bit below our agreed budget and we look forward to hire them again. We highly recommend American home improvement to anyone considering a remodel."
5,"We recently worked with Shlomo to paint my house inside and out. I purchased this house recently and the house needed to get a fresh look and makeover. Shlomo came by the house several times in order to define each space at the house for any color combination and texture in the common areas. What I loved about her was that she was able to get a great idea of what needed to be done. The color combinations and textures, were so impressive and beautiful that the samples of them could prove that immediately. From all the samples that she was able to do with her painters, it was super easy to imagine how it will look like and the process was very easy. In the outside of the house, her color combinations made the same effect and this was the killer point that caused me to hire her and the team of painters from American home improvement. One of the main problems that I had, was all the furniture and items that I had at the house. Shlomo was able to solve that immediately by assigning 3 people that came to the house prior to the painters and they moved all the furniture and cover them so it will be ready for the painters to do the actual paint. The whole work went smoothly and without any problem which made me very happy and proud at myself that I hired the right company for the job. I felt that Shlomo really understood my style and she did all she could to make this on the easiest way and with completely perfection. She really listened to what I was looking for and saved me a lot of time and stress. If I wasn’t hired Shlomo or contact American home improvement, I'm sure I would still be not able to find any other paint company that could make my house this way."
5,"We hired Daniel from American home improvement to paint the exterior of our home after using another painting company painted the interior of our home, which we were not satisfied with. During our meetings with Daniel and with his senior painter, we felt that he was honest, professional and really easy to communicate with. Daniel showed us his past homes he'd done in the past, which were amazing, but he was also open to our new ideas (that we saw or got from other places and magazines). When you are getting bids for exterior painting, you want people who are open to jobs that are creative and maybe a little more time consuming, but stunning when completed. That is exactly how Daniel is; he's allows you the time to walk the property and visualize what it could look like. He listens to you and actually paints things the way you want. Besides having a wealth of experience and knowledge, he is considerate of how a person feels about their home. He recognizes that to the buyer of services, the outcome of the services mean something to the homeowners. That's a very rare thing to find. He gave us a great quote and an excellent timeframe, and he stuck to it; even when he pointed out to us that we might consider a darker shade around our windows (that he had already painted!). In the end, we loved the paint colors and the way he made our house the most beautiful on the block. He was so easy to work with, he kept his word on everything we agreed on, and he showed up every day, on time!! His professionalism is unparalleled as far as I'm concerned. My neighbors noticed too; they had Daniel paint their houses as well! I am more than happy to recommend Daniel's work to anyone who is interested in having their home or business done. He is awesome!"
5,"We just finished our kitchen remodeling project and we have to write here that American home improvement did a great job and they beat our anticipations! While we were seating and talking about the technical aspects of the remodeling, David (our project manager) told us that the project will take anytime between 1.5 moths to 2 months at most and during that time, the workers and the sub-contractors will work on a daily basis making sure that everything will be done. Our expectations regarding the remodeling was that it will pass that time because they had to do so much and we thought that this time will not be enough. In fact, the workers did came each day to the house and they arrived on time while working very hard. The remodeling was completed in exactly a month and 5 days! We still cannot believe how they could finish it in such period of time, and in a great results. This great experience insured them that we will hire them again in the future for any additional work that we might do and we will never hire someone else other than American home improvement because they are skilled, professional and they do care about the satisfaction of their customers while focusing on what the client want before offering anything. We do recommend them to whoever needs any remodeling for their house or office."
5,"My mom asked me to help her find a contractor to remodel her bathroom & after seeing at least 5 contractors I decided to go with American home improvement. For one, they were the only company who I felt that was sincere to my moms needs & my gut feeling was right. My mom did not have any unpleasant experience throughout the whole ordeal. The workers were great & respectful & did a great job. Most of all she loves her new bathroom. She's considering on doing her kitchen sometime soon & she will definitely use them again."
5,"Shlomo was the American home improvement project manager for the recent kitchen and bathroom renovation that we recently did and his team of skilled and hardworking did a wonderful job. We greatly recommend American home improvement and mainly Mike, The working crew and the office staff that was involved in our project and we will hire them again for any additional remodeling project in our house. Shlomo was the project manager on both remodeling projects (kitchen and bathroom), did a perfect designing job for the kitchen space by using most of the existing space with features that we needed and wanted for a while now. From start to end, the extra attention that Shlomo put to all the details of both projects was more than what we were looking for. He always gave wonderful ideas and suggestions and he made sure that we are happy with all the decisions about both renovations. We love both projects very much! The kitchen and the bathroom got a completely brand new look and they are very functional for our needs. It makes us very happy each time any of us walk into any of them!"
5,"American home improvement and Daniel, did a great job by remodeling our bathroom. The group of workers came to our house every morning, on time and stayed till they were able to finish the work scheduled for that day. They completed what Daniel planned for them to do for that day and then they came back the following morning to continue the work under the supervision of Daniel. All the people that were involved in our project, were hardworking people and they were always on top of things even when issues came up – they were able to solve them while keeping the budget. The bathroom remodeling project was finished on the time frame that Daniel gave us before we hired him. 
We met and talked to Daniel few times before we made our final decision and that was because we wanted to be sure that we got the best deal and that they will be able to finish the work without any problem. Daniel was very nice to us and he was very easy person to work with. He explained us everything that was belong to the project and he was very pleasant man to talk to. We are very happy with Tibi home remodeling and if we ever decide on doing another remodeling project we would definitely hire them again."
5,"After four estimates I decided to hire American home improvement to do my kitchen remodeling. Isaac from American home improvement, came over to our house for the first scheduled meeting that we arranged with the office and he was very experienced with the process of the kitchen remodeling and he was able to answer each one of the questions we had. For the second meeting, He showed up and he brought a 3D design of how the new kitchen will look like which it was exactly the way we wanted our kitchen to look like after the remodeling project will be over. Isaac was also great when it came to the estimate because he gave us a realistic quote for the work and during the work, it was so easy to communicate with him by phone, text of via the office. When it come to the way they worked, we must admit that we are satisfied with that too because they at the end of each day, they kept the kitchen space clean and they used all kind of protection materials to keep all the dust and debris separate from the rest of the living spaces of the house during the whole construction so the house won’t get messy and dirty. We didn’t have to keep informing them about it and that showed us how they really care about us. Very reliable company, we will definitely use them again."
5,"American home improvement is definitely a top quality landscape and hardscape Construction Company and I highly recommend them for everyone that is interesting in a high quality & qualified landscape work. We met Daniel for the first time last year after we purchased our first house in LA area. We were impressed by his amount of understanding, expertise and sense of concept. He understood right away what we wanted to have and he was able to gather a great design draft of the front and back yard of the house including a detailed estimate. Due to limits in our overall budget, we ended up doing our back-yard first. Daniel’s team worked at the house from the beginning as promised and they completed the work on the projected achievement time. The crew appeared each day at the house and worked tough in order to keep the work as scheduled. The crew was managed by Carlos who is a professional foreman, pretty detail motivated person and responsive to our comments. We were so happy by the work they did, that a year after we hired Daniel to do the front yard. Also this time the work that they did was excellent. Daniel and his team truly converted our house and improved the value of our house. We recently moved to a bigger house and we decided to rent the other house that American home improvement had remodel the landscaping for. When we purchased the house, the front and back yard was remodeled by another contractor (that was done by the previous owner) and that work was too bad and horrible. The backyard concrete was so bad, that we had to remove all the concrete and pour new one. We called Daniel as we decided to redo this whole backyard. We knew that we can trust on Daniel’s opinion on how to fix all the problems. We appreciate the quality of work of Daniel and his team at American home improvement. We look forward to have Daniel do the front yard in in new house too and we will hire him for any future remodeling projects. We highly recommend Daniel and American home improvement for all of your landscape needs."
5,"We hired American home improvement to remodel and upgrade all 3 bathrooms and 4 bedrooms at our house. The remodeling included paint with new colors and texture, the replacement of all the windows with new ones and we added few benches in the shower areas. After that, we replaced all the vanities and added in-wall storage cabinets including all the crown molding around. On top of that, they painted all the bedrooms at the house and tear down all the wall paper around the house. In the kitchen area we replaced the existing appliances with new ones, while adding the back splash tiles, new paint and new LED lightings. New light fixtures were installed in the family room and living room. The house looks very good and beautiful! American home improvement did everything they promised and even few more things that were added in the middle of the work. I will hire them again in the future for my next remodeling project. Thank you American home improvement!"
5,"It’s been a while since I wanted to remodel my house and mainly my kitchen. After a massive research for a construction company, I decided to hire American home improvement and to have them do the remodeling. At first I met with Shlomo and we discussed about the options and what can I do for the amount that I can spend. Shlomo came up with his plan and I just loved it. He then was able to generate a price that did fit my budget and I gave my permission for the work. Now that my kitchen is completed, I can state that hiring American home improvement for the remodeling was in fact the best decision I have made and they are the most reasonable construction company that do have a great customer service and they are very professional. Shlomo did not try to push anything sell me any extra things. More than that he put my budget as the main priority thing. I will definitely recommend Shlomo and American home improvement for any remodeling project."
5,"This is the second time I have used American home improvement for a remodeling at my house and as I was very happy in the first remodeling, this time was even better and I’m happier with the new kitchen. The new kitchen remodeling that Tammy and his people did for us included the replacement of the wood floor with new travertine one, new upper and lower cabinets, new appliances, lighting fixtures, home automated switches and outlets, new counter top with back splash and new plumbing too. The workmanship is outstanding, the attention to details and even to the smallest ones was remarkable and they refer me to some great sources for kitchen appliances, travertine, marble slabs and more. Like the last time of the remodeling, Tammy handled all the minor extras that I wanted to do or change during the work without any complain and with a smile on his face. I will hire them again next year for my master bathroom and bedroom remodeling project."
5,"I hired Daniel at American home improvement on two complete bathrooms remodeling project including the kitchen at my house and I was very happy with how it went and mainly came out! Daniel and Whitney are both wonderful people to work with and it was very useful to have them both do the design and execute it into reality with the amount of expertise they have which made this remodeling a huge success for me. Daniel did a marvelous job by listening and understanding my design goals and balancing them with his design skills to come up with a productive, functional and within budget work. Whitney was everything I needed for this remodeling from the paperwork aspect of it. She made sure that billing, permits, materials orders and deliveries will be smooth and will arrive on time so the work will keep moving as agreed. Daniel’s devotion to all types of details was something that I didn’t think I can see in this remodeling. At the end, my high anticipations were exceeded and I have received many great compliments on how excellent the bathrooms and kitchen looks. I highly recommend American home improvement and I will for sure hire them again in the future!"
5,"Working with AHI was such a great experience! They were skilled, trustworthy and professional. They offered different options and ideas for our kitchen remodeling project.  They worked within our budget and we are very pleased with the result!"
5,"American home improvement planned and designed our outdoor living space and executed it after we approved all the changed and modifications so it will fit exactly to what we wanted to have. At first, we honestly didn’t think that we can get all what we wanted under our budget because it was just too many things in one project. The project that we wanted to do, included a 2 levels patio with space for full BBQ with dining area, sink, refrigerator, counter top and a large stone fire pit with seating area. More than that, we added some plantings spots by building a plats pots, a new grass area, LED solar lighting fixtures, a new driveway and more things. We’ve met and interviewed many contractors and home improvement companies and landscapers over the last few months and none of them was able to compete to Isaac’s experience, quality and promise to ensure their work with our expectations. Each one of them had something that caused us to move to the next one in our list and when we met with Isaac, we felt that this is the right person for us and for our project. He was very respectful, hardworking and neat. We are proud that we selected this company from all the rest and because of our great experience, we highly recommend American home improvement and Isaac including all the office staff that was involved in our house project."
5,"When my wife & I purchased our home, we have probably met at least 5 contractors to bid on our major remodeling because our new house needed a lot of work. We were very skeptical on hiring anyone considering the amount of work that we needed to do with a tight budget. Most of the contractors we talked to didn't give us a lot of options & the prices we got were just outrageous. Then we finally saw American Home Improvement & since they were local to us we decided to give it another shot. For the first time when we met with one of their project managers, he was the only representative who listened to what we actually really needed & told us that he would work with our budget. We had minor issues during the construction stage but my project manager was always there to make sure he addresses every concerns & issues that we have. The workers were professional & polite which is for me the most important thing. If I also need to call their office for whatever reason the personnel were always accommodating & friendly as well. Overall we had a great experience with this company but most importantly, we love our new home -- the quality of work was great & I'm really really happy I decided to go with American Home Improvement. That's why I'm taking this time to share my experience & they definitely deserve to be recommended & rated 5 stars!"
5,"After the results of the final remodeling project that we got from American home improvement, we can write here that we couldn’t have asked for anything better starting with a skilled team or people or a better finished bathroom and Kitchen remodeling project! From the very early meeting that we had and all the way to the last cleaning, Mickey and his team were totally brilliant. Mickey was most helpful in coming up with the right decisions for our goals, he was clear, straightforward and honest about each stage of the work including the small details. They all were on time, respectful, and professional. They took extra care and attention in making sure that everything will be covered before starting to work and completely clean area before they left for the day and most of all when they complete the entire project. We had a master bathroom and a brand new designed kitchen that was worth each and every penny. We highly recommend American home improvement and Mainly Mickey to anyone who is currently looking to have any type of a remodeling project done. We sure that it will be everything and anything you were looking for while being delivered by a skilled and professional team who really prove a commitment to customer satisfaction and a job well done!"
5,"Working with Michael and his crew at American home improvement was a great experience. All of them were honest, skilled and professional. Prior to hiring them, we got few other estimates and American home improvement one was detailed, clear to understand and fairly priced. Michael took the time to get over the entire remodeling, explaining us everything and unlike other companies no one from them pressured us or tried misleading. We were very happy to do business with them and we valued that Michael and his crew were great communicators and all the meetings and completion date were all on time. Michael managed the entire kitchen remodeling and there we had no surprises or extras charges. It went very smooth than we thought and we are more than happy with the new kitchen. It looks beautiful and very functional. We will recommend them to anyone! Mainly Michael at American home improvement."
5,"American home improvement is for sure a Top Notch construction company! Daniel is an excellent person that care a lot for the happiness of his clients while making sure to bring any remodeling come true with extra attention to perfection and details. He is well organized and very strict on the project timing. He met with us several times before we even got the design of the remodeling project, the meetings were mainly for him to listen and understand what we really want to get from this project and after he understood that part, he start to share his ideas that were basically an improvement to ours. His crew of skilled people were very polite, making sure to keep all the area clean and neat as much as they could, dealing with any issue that came up during the work right away. All of the people that were involved at this project, we responsive to any of our comments and questions and they fixed anything and everything. We couldn’t be more pleased with the remodeling project that they did (a complete kitchen remodeling) and with Daniel’s supervision. We do trust this company and we will hire them for any future projects at our home."
5,"Daniel including the crew of workers from American home improvement recently completed a major remodeling at our house and they assisted us understand how the construction process should go, and helped us to achieve what we wanted and still stay within the budget that we had before the work while producing our new kitchen and bathrooms as we imagined for a while now. Daniel worked with us closely from the begging by drafting a design as a starting point and presented us the prices for step of the work, time frame for completion, and more... We definitely felt that he knew what he is doing and that was very easy to realize. Two things that really set American home improvement from the rest of the contractors that we came across with was that they were very clear about the work, more expert about the construction process and dedicated to our happiness. Thank you American home improvement - we could not be happier."
5,"We were looking to remodel our vacation house early of this year, and we wanted to create a brand new and functional living space that provided us an open layout and flow. Our budget was pretty fixed and we needed someone that will be able to do it within that amount. Together with Michel, we were able to create a perfect solution that allowed us to open up most of the kitchen wall and generating an additional opening that finally now can allow us to move and work on both sides of our Kitchen Island. All of our family fell in love with the new space and we enjoy cooking and entertaining all of our guests and family that come over from time to time. We are very happy and satisfied that our friends were able to refer us to American home improvement and are very fascinated by their amount of experience and craftsmanship. By working and dealing with Michel, we can state clearly that he was able to take away all the stress and worries of this big change for our house and he was able to turn our kitchen into something much better and larger than we ever imagined."
5,"This year we purchased a ""fixer"" on in a community near our main house. We have completed several remodeling projects over the last 20 years, all gradually more powerful and all as an owner-builder. Since this was the most challenging project, we decided to go with a company that can design and do the actual remodeling rather than hiring an architect and then searching for a bid from general contractors. We thought that we can have a bigger effect on the design and to create an efficiency by using a good team to reach the milestones together and shortening the process. Michael from American home improvement, has verified to be the perfect choice for us and he was able to start the work immediately after we closed escrow. We worked hand by hand in the initial design stage using 3D designs, floor plans and elevations drawn by Michelle presenting to us several choices and making changes on the way. After this process was completed, Michelle’s team produced for us the necessary plans and handled all the permits. 
Our contract was in two parts:
-First part ‘Design’
-Second part remodeling’ 
We were very happy and satisfied with the cost of the design, mainly because it included a promise of a good discount in case we go with American home improvement for the second part. When we decided to hire them for the second part, we were so happy with the quality and effort that American home improvement did for us that the discount was not that important no more. Michelle earned the additional benefit! This was a large project so keeping a sharp pencil has been critical in establishing costs within the budget. Michelle worked closely with us and allowed us to save the cost by making the project possible. It has been only three weeks since the remodeling was completed, but our years of experience in remodeling, we can see that our decision was well made. No struggle was wasted and there is no doubts about all the different teams of workers that worked on this remodeling."
5,"We had a truly excellent experience with American home improvement. Our remodeling project was to take down completely the old kitchen, rebuild it and remodel our 2 bedrooms, bathrooms and living room including the laundry room. The work started on the day and time that was set during our meetings with Jason and it was done on the day and time (with few days after due to some minor delays in the delivery of some materials) and it mainly stayed on our budget. The team of Jason listened to our comments and questions and they were very responsive to the approved design plan. They were very reliable, careful, and professional people. They were easygoing people to work with and to have in our house every day. Jason was able to make this remodeling project as easy as possible even though sometimes it was hard because all the problems that were raised during the work. I highly recommend American home improvement."
5,"Our recent experience with American home improvement and especially with Daniel was very good. We hired them to do a complete remodeling of our kitchen. Daniel was able to provide us with a great design that contained most things we wanted, custom cabinets, new flooring, granite counter tops and the relevant appliances (Ref, Dishwasher, stove and hood). Daniel and his people were able to finish the new kitchen in less than a month and the new kitchen came out the way we wanted and even more. What we mostly appreciate is that the overall price was within our budget and even though we did some changes during the work, Daniel did all he could in order to not add any hidden charges."
5,"I never imagined that my kitchen remodeling can be completely very fast and in a fairly price! Mickey and Elad were honest the whole time, consistent, supportive and just easy people to deal with. Before hiring them, I got several estimates and they were all higher than the one I got from Mickey. Their estimate also included more things than the other contractors such as higher quality of materials and home automation features such as outlets, lightings and thermostat. As part of the remodeling, Mickey was able to give me great suggestions on what I can and should include into the design of the kitchen and into the final product. I am very satisfied with the whole thing! Mickey went with me to his local vendors where I purchased the items I needed for the kitchen (flooring, tiles, countertops, handles, back splash and more…) – I can't say enough good things about them!"
5,"I am very pleased with the work that was performed by Mickey and his team. A friend recommended me to hire American home improvement for my house remodeling after he heard about the problem I’m currently having with the contractor that I just hired for my house in which caused me several problems at the beginning of the remodeling. After I called their office, Mickey called me and came over to my house the next day, checked and reviewed the work that was done and what still need to be completed while focusing on several problems that were caused by the previous one.  Few days later, he came back once again and presented to me his complete and fairly priced estimate on the entire work that still needed to be done in order to finish it. After our lawyer took care of the other contractor, I went ahead and hired Mickey to step in and finish the work. Mickey started to work few days after and his team came over to the house and started the work. Mickey came over the house each day to supervise the workers and to make sure that everything is going according to the plan while oversee the workers. He even did some of the work himself and the work was performed in a professional way, quick, polite and professional. I am very happy with the entire remodeling job of my kitchen, bathroom, entry, dining room and bathrooms and I strongly recommend them."
5,"Our house had a big water damage emergency and we were in a search for someone that will be able to bring all the damage spaces in the house so we can move back to our home. What we needed to do was to remodel the dining room, kitchen, powder room and the guest room including 2 bathrooms. On top of it, we needed to install new hardwood floor all around the first floor and to replace some light fixtures. The kitchen remodeling was the most complex one because it included the replacement of all the cabinets, counter-tops, sink, appliances, back-splash and all the finishing items. All the people that did the actual work at our house were professional, polite and hardworking. American home improvement did an amazing job and it was a pleasure to work and dealt with. The complete restoration project was done in a very timely manner. We definitely hire them again."
5,"We cannot write enough words about how happy are we with our kitchen remodeling that was done by American home improvement and managed by Daniel and his team of workers. His tremendous he started by helping us selecting the cabinets for the kitchen, floors, tiles, marble counter tops and all the finishing items such as the handles and more… more than that, all the office staff that were involved too, were very professional and polite during the entire work. In addition to that, the sub-contractors and vendors were also professional, experts, knowledgeable and honest in their tasks. The remodeling was finished on time and within our budget. They were well-ordered and the house was cleaned up after each day of work before they left the house for the day. We could not be happier and the new kitchen is absolutely gorgeous. More than all the above, Daniel didn’t try to either pressure us to sign any contract or to push us to add more items that we don’t need."
5,"Our remodeling project started with the wrong company that we hired for our second story addition and a complete first floor remodel on our 1100 sq./ft. house. When this happened, we left with a house that was unlivable. The walls were out of plumbing pipe, beams were missing and in a total complete mess. One of our friends recommended us to hire several companies that can come and finish the work but in the end, we felt that this will cause more and more problems. As our search kept going, we came across American home improvement and when we met with them at the house, we spoke to Daniel and told him what we want and if it can be done. Daniel came back to us few days after with a plan on how to take over and to complete the work so we can move in and start to enjoy our new house. While Daniel and his team did their plans and suggestions, we did more and more research about them because we wanted to be sure that our house will be completed. After all of our additional meetings with Daniel, We decided that we will hire them and we went forward with our remodeling project. Daniel and his teams of skilled people rebuilt our house in a better way than it should have been done from the beginning. He was able to combine his skills and vision in order to deliver outstanding product. The house came out much more beyond our expectations. He visited the house on a daily basis and managed the crews on top of ordering all the materials and scheduling all the subcontractors that worked at the house as well. Now that the house is complete and we already moved to the house, we can mention that our house is the evidence that they know how to take any remodeling project and to complete it while making the clients happy and without any stress. American home improvement price was very reasonable for the work that they did on our home. We truly hope that no one will have to go thru our first experience, but if they do... than they need to make sure to hire the right contractor that will be able to complete any remodeling project. American home improvement is a company that I would hire again without reservation."
5,"My husband & I hired American home improvement back in 2014 and we were pleased with the results of the work that they did at our previous house. This time, we hired them once again to do a remodeling of our kitchen and bathrooms at our new house and Sam & his team of skilled people were again amazing people. They all came to work on time & Sam made sure to keep everything under budget. The scope of this remodeling just increased our trust and appreciation in American home improvement. On top of the kitchen and bathrooms remodeling, we also painted the house inside & out, got rid of all the popcorn ceilings throughout the house & added LED lights too. Sam is a professional, designer & great listener. He heard us in order for not only understanding what we want but helping us make our vision come true. Our house is now what we really knew it could be. Thank you Sam & your wonderful team for this great remodeling at our house.  We thank Sam & everyone at American home improvement! We have already recommended them to several friends."
5,"We give Ziv and David (from American home improvement) a A+ rating for the remodeling project that they did for us.
 The remodeling project involved the kitchen which includes: 
-Installing granite counters
-New back-splash and cabinets
-Relocating and installing the new stove and sink 
-Installing new lighting system.
 In addition to the kitchen, they did other few projects in other parts of the house like:
-Raising the entry ceiling.
-Putting in new doors, etc. 
We adore the completed remodeling every day since it was completed a month ago. We found American home improvement on the internet and we asked them to meet with us about in regards to the kitchen. We were fascinated with their knowledge, and design ideas. While they prepared the proposal, Ziv came over to the house more than once and meet with us before we signed the contract. Once we started the work, we valued his capability to manage the project. They met with us at the cabinet maker’s shop where we saw several cabinet Designs, and they assist us with all the details. Ziv did a great job with all his communications with us and with all the other people involved. Ziv and the whole crew were friendly and great workers. They followed through on all fronts and exceeded our expectations. We are very happy with the final outcome and give our highest praises to American home improvement."
5,"After a big research that we did that included meetings and interviews several of them, we ended up hiring American home improvement. Isaac was assigned to us as the manager for the project and the supervisor for the crew. He was professional and straightforward with the costs. His communication skills were great and he was available for us to answer all of our questions and ideas. This showed us how he was passionate and eager to get the job right and not below than perfection. After Isaac presented us with the designs, we set and run numbers to see how can we fir everything within our budget. Surprisingly enough, Isaac was able to fit 90% of our vision into the budget so the decision to go ahead with the work was finalized and set. More than that, American home improvement was able to share with us the cost of the design which made it much better for us because we could add more items to the remodeling. Our remodeling project was to renovate the entire kitchen and to replace all the appliances and flooring. We want to thank Jacob and the rest of American home improvement for everything they did for us."
5,"After a long time of research and interviewing several companies, I hired this company to do the work. The work started with several meetings with Mickey and we spoke on what to do and how to do including the styles, relocation of the refrigerator and the time scheduling. Mickey managed this whole thing and he had his crew working each day while reporting to him about their progress. The first week of work was demolition the old kitchen and prepare the space for the installation of the cabinets. During the whole work, we had no problem with them or with the communications between us to Mickey or his office. I’m happy with the new kitchen and with the work that they did."
5,"I had a very good experience working with American home improvement. I worked with a Shlomo who was my project manager and he was very resourceful and skilled person. When I met with him, he brought several samples of similar projects that he did recently and he shared with me many ideas that could fit to my remodeling while he was very focused to what I wanted. During the second and third meeting that we had, he went over with me on all the details of the work and even brought a digital design of how the new kitchen will look like after the remodeling! The final kitchen remodeling was exactly like the design he had designed. The cost of it was fair and good and I never got the feeling that he is trying to add more money to the work or by making any short cuts. They had very skilled working crew as well and they were able to complete the kitchen remodeling in a very fairly time!"
5,"I hired American home for a remodel of my guest house and addition of a master suite, I couldn't be happier with the work they did. My project manager Shawn was always available to answer my questions and the work turned out better than I imagined."
5,Excellent job!! American Home Improvement has done an incredible work remodeling my kitchen! I could not be any happier with the work done. It completely changed the look of my house! I highly recommend this company!!
5,"Working with Shawn was great, after visiting their location and meeting the  staff I felt very comfortable with my decision to remodel. 

The process wasn't always easy but Shawn made it easy for us to live in the home during construction. The workers were very polite and the projects were completed on time and I couldn't be happier."
5,"American home improvement helped me remodel and completely make my home energy efficient and made it affordable for my family to do so with a energy efficiency financing option. All of the employees there knew how to guide me and answer all of my questions during the project. I have a new roof, texcoat and windows. I was also able to upgrade my electrical panel and will be having solar panels installed in the next few months."
5,"Great working with this contractor, my bathroom needed some serious work and we found mold in the process of demilolition. Jeff did his best to keep the cost reasonable and the project was completed at our satisfaction."
5,"I'm very happy with the results of the work performed by American home improvement, the kitchen looks spectacular and I couldn't be happier with the crew and Micky my project manager very responsive with all my concerns and questions during the process."
5,Victoria and Mike kept us up to date all  on the details progress of the kitchen remodel and living room update. Victoria's vision fit the house and what we were looking for in a new kitchen. She was always quick to answer any question we had. They worked around us being in the house. The electricians worked past midnight on one occasion trying to solve a problem that turned out to be a power company issue.  Very happy with the outcome of the remodel and have gotten many compliments on the change.
5,"Laura at S & W Kitchens was fantastic to work with, she listened and deigned my perfect kitchen! I absolutely love my kitchen!"
5,"From start to finish, S&W did a fantastic job on our kitchen, bedroom and bathroom remodel!  From Traci, the designer, to Kevin, the Project Manager, they were always on top of things and extremely responsive and communicative.  Would definitely use S&W again for any future remodeling!"
5,"We chose S&W Kitchens to renovate our guest bathroom.  This extremely small bath had all original fixtures dating back 34 years.  We began the process in October 2021 by visiting the Longwood design center.  Later we called to schedule an estimate and they paired us with Sarah.  From start to finish on this project Sarah has been amazing.  Since this was our first remodel she walked us through the entire process never hesitating to answer all our questions.  

She never tried to persuade us in any one direction on colors, tile or fixture selection.  Being new to this process we would ask for her design opinions and she was always honest and upfront about each item.  Sarah corresponded with us on multiple occasions throughout the life of this renovation to ensure all was going as planned and to inquire about any of our questions, comments or concerns.  

Throughout the life of this renovation there were a number of contractors who came to work on this project:  plumbers, concrete cutters, a framer, tile installers, painters, drywall installers, electrician, threshold installers and delivery personnel.  All of these contractors were highly skilled in their field.  All the contractors on our project were very respectful to us and even cleaned the work area before leaving each day.  

Our renovation took three months from the start of construction.  In all, a total of 35 days from the first home visit to the last walk-thru.  We are so extremely pleased with all the quality work which has been done throughout the course of the project.  We have a beautiful guest bathroom to enjoy for years to come.    

Sarah was our rockstar!  She is so kind, patient and puts the client first.  She is easy to talk to and discuss ideas and appears to really enjoy her work.  We will definitely request Sarah for our next renovation."
4,"We recently finished our master bathroom remodel with Sarah Kraus, and now we're starting on the guest bathroom. Sarah was fabulous! In addition to her detailed design work, Sarah was patient, kind and responsive to emails and phone calls. Best of all, she was an advocate for us when we had workmanship questions or concerns. That's the primary reason we chose to work with her again."
5,"We just had our first experience with remodeling our kitchen and S&W Palm Harbor did not disappoint! Shirley Aguilu, project designer, and Steve Cota, superintendent, are outstanding...their knowledge, guidance and patience throughout the project made the experience very pleasant. We had many questions since this was our first remodel and they were friendly, trustworthy and responsive. Everyone including the contractors and installers had an impressive attention to detail and their workmanship was top notch! We are so thrilled with the end result and highly recommend them!!"
1,"We hired them Feb 2021 to remodel two bathrooms and outdoor grill. Absolute disaster! Attached is what our master bathroon looks like now April 2022. We have finally come to the point where we had to make a claim against our insurance. Beware of this company. Our designer was Sarah Kraus. Never saw her after the demo. The first GM for the job Brian Pop, he walked out right after everything was demo'd. The second GM Pete Coffman was just as bad. Actually caught them trying to cover up water damaged wood caused by them using cheap materials. They hung up towel racks with just screws, not anchors. Towel rack fell down during first use! Seriously BEWARE! We have water damage and a bathroom still torn up after more than a year."
5,"I recently finished 2 bathrooms with S&W in Palm Harbor, Florida.  Kirsten Phillips was our designer and Mike Frary was the project manager/GC.  They were fantastic.  S&W has an app that allows you to know exactly what is scheduled each day, what is planned and easily connect with the team.  All of the subcontractors were pleasant, respectful and helpful. I am sure it wasn’t easy, one bathroom is on 2nd story, one on 3rd story. I had a vision of what I wanted, shared that and pictures with Kirsten and she helped me through all of the processes.  I picked out things that I knew I wanted and she helped guide me in areas I was unsure.  We built the house 20 years ago and kept putting off doing the bathrooms.  Now I am so happy, I should have done it sooner.  I highly recommend S&W, they were fantastic to work with.  And huge thanks to Shirley A who helped set me up with Kirsten to keep personal friendship and business separate."
4,"S&W Kitchens did a great job with our kitchen renovation. We have a small kitchen that was not in the best shape and we were really looking for design solutions to create more useable space without changing the footprint of the kitchen. Sarah was our designer and really listened to what we wanted and did a excellent job designing our new kitchen. She also provided us with many options within our budget so we could get something that fit our aesthetic without breaking the bank. The only issue with the whole process was with our backsplash tile, but Sarah and our site supervisor Adam, listened to our concerns and worked to address the problem so that we were happy with the results."
5,"My wife and I were very pleased with the professional experience we had with S & W Kitchens Palm Harbor.  The designer, Shirley Aguilu, provided excellent ideas, listening to our ideas, and producing a kitchen renovation plan that encompassed all of our requests.  The team, including Shirley, Steve, Tony and Amber, were on top of all aspects of the complete kitchen renovation.  This included frequent contact to ensure the job was being completed, and ensuring all segments (installing floor tile, cabinets, laundry room, countertops, backsplash, plumbing and electrical work) were correctly completed.  We highly recommend S & W Kitchens Palm Harbor, for their work."
5,"All we can say is WOW!  S&W Kitchen did a fantastic job renovating our kitchen. The difference between our old kitchen and new is like night and day. Our kitchen was old, falling apart, cabinet doors not closing, bowing shelves and poor lighting.  Lindsey Schwartz, our Project designer, was great to work with. She guided us through choosing cabinets, flooring, backsplashes and every detail of our kitchen make-over.  She pointed out less expensive choices although we did not always listen, and different options. The demolition and installations teams were all very professional and courteous. They always let us know what they were going to be doing and when.  We highly recommend S&W Kitchens."
5,"S&W Kitchens does fantastic work—from the design all the way to the punch list. They were perfectionists with our home. Our designer, Laura, listened carefully to our needs and came up with a beautiful design. She gave us just enough choices that we felt like it was our personal design without being overwhelmed by selections. We remodeled our kitchen, master bath and guest bath, and we couldn’t be more pleased with the results. We feel like we have a custom home. We fell in love with our construction crew—Kevin, Steven, Scott and Brian along with top notch subcontractors. They were meticulous about their work and took care of every tiny detail. They were professional and friendly too. We felt very comfortable having them in our home—whether we were at home or away. We have recommended S&W to family and friends."
5,"Our Kitchen & Fireplace were very out dated!  We had heard good things about S & W Kitchens so we went to check them out.  Our first impression was great.  We met with Designer, Amy Downs and was very impressed with her knowledge & experience.  She has amazing design ideas!  Signed our contract & we were ready to start.  We then met with the contractor, Davin Johnson.  He was also very experienced & professional.  Renovations can be a bit stressful, but we new we were in good hands!  Davin always updated us as to what was happening and when.  We got finished before our due date!  We can't thank S & W Kitchens enough for our beautiful transformation!  Oh yes, and we got our house professionally cleaned too, the team was amazing!!  My house was spotless.  We would definitely use them again."
5,"Victoria Pratt was an outstanding partner and provided a level of customer service that I truly appreciate.  She was friendly, informative, and helpful while we made our choice of wood countertop.  I first went online to find an outstanding butcher block or wood countertop product, called the manufacturer of the product and was informed S&W Kitchen was their distributor of that product in the Tampa Bay area, near our home.  Once I went in and started engaging with Victoria she struck me as highly professional, informative and knowledgeable about the product and how it would look in our kitchen remodel.  Victoria took the time to come out, see the kitchen remodel and helped me select a product.  She was also there upon delivery of a 200+ lb wood countertop and helped me quickly find an expert installer for such a beautiful product.  I enjoyed working with Victoria and would recommend her services and S&W Kitchen to anyone who asked."
5,"My kitchen remodel is so beautiful!  The project manager Brian,  communicated effectively so were kept informed of timelines and next steps. Our designer, Marilyn listed to what we wanted and helped us create our dream kitchen! All of the contractors were very professional and treated my home respectively. They even greeted my nosy puppy who had to come say hello to everyone who came to the house. Highly recommend!"
5,"S and W did our kitchen makeover after 44 years of living in this house.
I found them to be very professional, clean and respectful of our property.
I would suggest them to anyone considering a renovation"
5,"From the start of the bathroom remodel to the end, Whitney at S & W Kitchens took a dream of what we wanted our bathroom to be and made it a reality. Our bathroom was original from 1988 and needed to be completely upgraded! At the start we scheduled a visit with Whitney and laid out the parts we needed and wanted to incorporate into our bathroom. Whitney then helped us to pick out a color scheme and quartz countertop, tiles, floor, lights and accessories. After about a week, Whitney drew up a CAD design to show us how the bathroom would look like and showed us. We immediately loved it and signed the paperwork to get it started. Because of the pandemic and wood shortages, it took about a month to get all the supplies together for the bathroom (Still good if you ask me) and then they delivered them to our garage for safekeeping. Mike, our foreman, met with us to lay out the work schedule for the remodel and set a demo date. Mike was attentive to our work schedule and our concerns of making sure our cat did not get out. Therefore, Mike made sure to let us know when people would be coming so we could put our cat in a room. All of the people who came to work on the bathroom respected our privacy of not going in the doors that was marked that our pet could be in. Over the 6 months of the remodel (This was finished on time), Mike and Whitney were available for any and all questions, concerns and gave updates on everything. Our bathroom exceeded our expectations on how it was going to be. The new shower is roomier and awesome, more cabinet space and the countertops and sinks are spectacular! We both are very impressed with Whitney and Mike at S & W kitchens and without hesitation will use them again in the future!"
5,Excellent work and professionalism! Would hire again. They worked with us to make sure we were satisfied with all our choices.
5,"Having our kitchen redone with S&W Kitchens has been a complete life changing experience.  We own a 100 year old bungalow that had an original kitchen with granite slapped on top of the teeny tiny dollhouse size cabinetry.  We knew when we bought our house we would redo the kitchen, but had no idea with whom.  We stumbled upon S&W online and read through the reviews.  Larissa designed us the kitchen of my dreams, within our budget, while thinking of every detail and how we could maximize storage and obtain the aesthetic and type of environment that were so important to me.  Our superintendent, Christian, was excellent through the entire process.  The amount of time and effort he put into the construction of our kitchen totally surpassed by expectations.  If you are considering a kitchen reno I highly recommend S&W for the job, and HIGHLY recommend specifically working with Larissa, you will not regret it."
5,"S&W completely remodeled our kitchen and two baths.  Did it all go super smooth?  Not really, but what did go consistently right was designer Lacie Rice.  She worked with my wife and me from the beginning to the end and helped to resolve issues that arose along the way.  We are more than satisfied with the results and cannot speak highly enough about Lacie."
5,"Total bath remodel; pricey and started months later than we'd hoped - partially due to COVID and personnel change, but once started, project manager Davin was on top of all, employees and subs were all professional and we are very pleased with final product."
5,"We enjoyed working with S&W Kitchens! We built a new house and used them for not only the kitchen, but all the bathrooms as well. Everything turned out beautiful. Mollie was great to work with, very helpful & informative! Even though things were delayed due to Covid, we were in the loop throughout the whole process. The installer's attention to detail is 2nd to none. We are beyond happy with the way everything turned out in our home!!"
5,S&W is a five star company.  Lacie and Steve were excellent to work with and kept us informed through every step of the process.  We plan to use S&W for third project to renovate our kitchen.  If you have a project go with S&W and ask for Lacie and Steve.
5,"FANTASTIC Experience! We have been working out of our home since March of 2020 so we decided now would finally be the time to upgrade the kitchen to one we had been dreaming of for many years. We did our homework, read reviews and visited the S&W Kitchens Showroom in Melbourne, Florida. We were greeted by Laura Scott who was friendly, knowledgeable, professional, and honest, which made it easy to quickly develop a trust relationship with her. Laura ultimately became our Designer and as she gathered our requirements, she listened to all of our wish lists and concerns, and she shared lessons learned to help guide our decision making. She offered excellent suggestions and ultimately created a design that far exceed our expectations and enhanced the layout and function of the original blueprint. She also provided quick and timely communication throughout the entire process. Laura delivered on every promise she made, and she routinely stopped by to check in on the progress and make sure our expectations were being met. 

We had a pre-construction meeting at our home where we met the various superintendents and project managers that would be overseeing the job. We were provided with documentation that included all of our diagrams and decisions, and a thorough timeline of when we could expect events to occur. They offered expert advice on what to expect and answered all of our questions. They even were considerate of our dogs and ensured us of their safety. Our Project Superintendent, Vinny Mallo, provided excellent communication on scheduled workdays and arrival times. He worked closely with the crews and provided thorough oversight. The crews (demo, plumbing, electrical, cabinet install, backsplash tile, countertops) were extremely professional and provided quality work in a timely manner. From the virtually invisible seams on the beautiful quartz countertops to the expertly laid intricate backsplash tile, we were so impressed with the quality of work. They were always on time and presented virtually no disruptions to us, even in our telework environment. We were also impressed with how clean they kept the environment, hauling away debris at the end of the work days, and keeping all of our areas orderly. 

Bottom line…we are EXTREMELY happy, highly recommend Laura Scott, and S&W Kitchens and would definitely use their services again."
5,"S&W Kitchens brought me out of the 70s! My remodel was better than I ever expected and the cost less than estimates I had received from other companies. The remodel included removing my walls and ceilings down to the studs. After our first meeting, my designer, Sarah Kraus, knew exactly what I wanted and needed. She went by my color schemes and chose the cabinets, tile, backsplash and lighting perfectly. I love the results!  
My supervisor, Brian Pope, responded to my calls and any questions I had immediately.  I felt he went over and above what was expected of him. Both projects were done on schedule and my home was kept as clean as possible while the work was in process. I now have an open floor plan and a beautiful, efficient kitchen and master bathroom. I would highly recommend S&W Kitchens and especially Sarah and Brian. Thank you for my beautiful finished project."
5,"We wanted to update our kitchen and laundry room. We wanted to replace our builder grade cabinets and granite counter tops with high quality cabinets (with better organization), quartz counter tops and slab backsplash. I spent a lot of time planning my dream kitchen and laundry room. Right down to the last detail. We also needed new sinks, faucets, and pendant lights. One of the biding companies expected us to source these items our selves. What a pain! That was one of the main reasons we chose S & W Kitchens and Bath. 

The other reason we pick S & W was after meeting our designer, Lacie Rice. She came to our home and took measurements and listened while I laid out my vision. She made the process so easy. I met with her several times in the showroom in Tampa to shop and design. She found everything I wanted. She even matched the outlet covers on the island with the cabinet color. 

We met with construction manager Steve Cota and Designer Lacie for a final walk through of the plans and discuss the process. Everything was explained thoroughly. The estimate and final contract were meticulously detailed. We could see where every dollar would be spent.

Every team (demo, plumbing, electrical, drywall, paint, cabinet install and counter fabricator) worked hard. They were respectful and tidy. Every step of the way Steve and Lacie were accessible. The back and forth communication was excellent. The permits all passed with no issues. They even sent cleaners before my house guests arrived for a holiday weekend.

The quality of the Omega cabinets are excellent. The color is perfect. The Cambria Quartz counters and backsplash are beautiful. The kitchen and laundry room are much more functional now, too. Everything looks exactly how I had pictured in my mind. We couldn’t be happier with the results. It looks amazing!!!"
5,"We are so pleased with the total kitchen renovation we recently completed with S&W Kitchens in South Tampa. We literally demolished our original kitchen, removing walls, going all the way down to the studs and built a brand new kitchen. Our designer, Larissa Hicks and her design assistant, Gina Cerimele were able to take our basic kitchen ideas and design the perfect kitchen for us. The design process was very collaborative and at the end they were even able to come up with some creative solutions to keep our project within our budget. The construction phase went very smoothly. When we came across a “load bearing beam” in an unexpected place, the team quickly adjusted the design plan with minimal cost incurred. Mike Frary was our construction supervisor and he did a great job keeping us informed and the job on schedule. I highly recommend S&W Kitchens and designer Larissa Hicks for anyone who is doing a kitchen renovation."
5,"S&W Kitchens did an amazing job on our kitchen and bath remodel! Greg Flassig was our designer, and he did an amazing job! Also Pete Coffman worked with us to get the construction done. He was great at explaining everything, as well as promptly answering any questions we had. Both were there for us the entire time. The crew did a great job. Thanks for a great job!"
4,"We had our master bath remodeled.  It took a little longer than expected for the project to be completed.  Part of the delay was due to the shortage of building materials, not S&W Kitchen's fault.  The Kitchen & Bath Project Designer, Sarah Kraus Bartelson, and Super Intendent, Brian Popp were helpful, efficient, and easy to work with. 

We love our master bath and this company has our recommendation!!!

Lonise"
5,"Our new kitchen is stunning! The whole experience was so well organized from planning, choosing materials, and construction completion. Our designer, Mayerlin, was very helpful and responsive. S&W stayed true to budget and on schedule. All of the contractors who came to work in our home were on time, dependable, professional, and very clean. I will definitely use S&W again. Highly recommend!"
5,"In one word, AWESOME!  I hired S&W Kitchens to remodel both of my bathrooms and my laundry room in a condo that I had just purchased.  I have done some other renovation projects in the past and I was concerned that they wait until all your materials are in stock before they start.  But now I totally get that concept!  There were delays with a few items and I wasn’t waiting around in a demolished house.  Demo started once everything arrived!  Savana, Dale, Kevin and the rest of the team did an amazing job.  They were kind and courteous to me.  And clean, neat and respectful of my home.  If a problem came up, they fixed it immediately.  They finished a week early and stayed on budget.  When I’m ready to do my kitchen, they will be my first phone call.  I would highly recommend S&W Kitchens for any remodeling project."
5,"It was amazing to see my design come to reality in this kitchen renovation. The S&W kitchens team was  so amazing.  My designer Sarah Kraus and my construction Superintendent Brian Popp were so professional and stayed on to of creating the specks /details ,and scheduling all the different contractors and inspections in a smooth manner. They really hire excellent subcontractors that really know their specialties very well. They all cleaned up their  area very well after each job,  protected the furniture and floors very well, and were careful not to damage their surroundings. They subcontracted Zolt Granite for the quartz and they too did an excellent job. The only 2 drawbacks I had was that I went into contract after Thanksgiving 2020 and the project did  not commence until the 6th of January 19, 2021. Luckily the project was completed in 4 weeks. The other concern is that they were a lot more expensive than we thought, but they really provide quality work, so that really counts."
5,"We engaged S&W Kitchens to assist with renovating our kitchen.  Our project was relatively small.  It involved replacing the existing granite countertop with an quartz countertop as well as making alterations to the configuration of our counter.  S&W also performed ancillary work such as replacing our kitchen sink and faucet.  They also replaced the countertop and sink in our laundry room and make some modifications to enable our dryer to fit properly.  Laura Scott was our designer and she remained involved throughout the project to ensure our satisfaction.  We were impressed by Laura's professionalism as well as by the quality of S&W's work.  We were provided detailed plans for our project which the various tradesmen followed to a tee.  Our project was completed efficiently, on time and with minimal disruption to our home.  S&W expended a lot of effort on detailed finishing to make sure that every aspect of the countertop, as well as the existing cabinetry, was perfect.  We would highly recommend S&W Kitchens for any home remodeling need."
2,"The full review is too long for houzz's submission field. Here is an abbreviated review.

We had several problems with S&W and I could not recommend them as a premium service.

They mis-measured our kitchen from the start and didn't catch that error until months into the project. We had to redesign the kitchen on the fly and they don't seem to take responsibility for the fact that we did not receive the kitchen we ordered.

They are clearly accepting more work than they can handle, and their workers are exhausted and distracted. This led to several errors. My full review has a page worth of bullet points as the errors were numerous and costly.

They damaged expensive materials, and left us to find the problems. There are finish issues that remain to be completed, and I have been waiting nearly a month for any answer to my ongoing issues.

This project also took month's longer than the original completion date.

Our foreman quit our project any further repairs pretty much finished once they got things nice enough for a pretty picture.

Some of their ""premium"" products are already having issues with coatings coming off, and blemishes from install that were never repaired.

They are a mediocre service charging a premium price."
5,"We selected to use S&W Kitchens in Longwood after reading all their reviews and completing a consultation meeting with our designer to complete the total remodel of our kitchen & 3 bathrooms in our home. Considering that we had started this big project in late February/early March 2020 prior to Covid-19, we are very happy with the final results and end product and design. The whole remodel did take longer than expected and there were a few delays & hiccups...but over all we love our new kitchen and bathrooms. Sarah, our personal Designer was an instrumental part in the entire process and a joy to work with. She was professional, open-minded in our vision, creative and understanding to what we wanted in our home regarding design & specific efficient functional needs for our family...also all while keeping our budget in mind without compromising quality and design. Robert our General Contractor was experienced & knowledgeable and also was pleasant to work with and was in communication with us and the entire team. Our entire S&W project team Sarah, Robert, David, Kevin & Craig were professional and great to work with. We are very satisfied with the work performed and look forward to enjoying our home with family & friends. Thank you to our S&W Kitchens Longwood Team for bringing our longtime vision for our kitchen/baths remodel into a beautiful reality. It was all well worth it!  ~Dan & Tiffany Marcos"
5,"S&W Kitchens, Melbourne proved to be a “first-class” company to address renovation of my master bath which was damaged following a lightning strike at my home.  Because the bathroom had been completely gutted (ceiling, drywall, cabinets), the challenge was to salvage as much of the original custom cabinetry, fixtures etc. using my own contractors (plumbers, electricians, cabinet installer etc.) and then replace my countertops and vanity sinks for an updated look and style.  From the moment I entered the S&W state-of-the art showroom, I was impressed with the array of choices and quality of products.  More importantly, I discovered that designer Laura Smith is worth her weight in gold!   Laura carefully listened to my needs and guided me every step of the way.  After her visit to my home, we selected the Kohler sinks and the perfect Pompeii quartz (Valley Sand) with copper veining to compliment my existing maple cabinets and Plantation Shutters.  As an added bonus, due to her prior background in working at a plumbing showroom, she also advised me of drain assembly parts needed for my existing faucets and provided other helpful-hints for the re-build.  She was able to schedule countertop installation within a short timeframe (far more quickly than other Melbourne fabricators).  Throughout this project Laura communicated frequently with me and was professional, pleasant and caring.  I am delighted with the results!"
5,"Back in January, we started the process to renovate our main living space focused around our kitchen, we delayed construction some as we wrapped our heads around working/schooling from home in March/April.  Starting in June, the construction made an already hectic summer that much more interesting, but in the end it was totally worth it...  working from home post-renovation these last couple of months has been that much more enjoyable!  Here's a few pics of before and the professional final shots.  Anyone looking for a recommendation, S & W Kitchens was so great to work with!!"
5,"This review is late in the making. Sarah Kraus did such a great job in designing my master bath and bedroom. This is the second time she has worked with me, which says something. If you have not worked with a designer you need to. What I love about Sarah she not only helps me get ideas, but she is hands on from beginning to end. With any remodel project things come up. Sarah handled every concern I had, amazing. I love my new space. Can’t believe it is the same room."
1,"We were excited to begin a remodel of our outdated kitchen, laundry room, dinning room, living room and office and decided to use S&W Kitchens, even though the price was considerably higher due to their promise of excellent service and customer satisfaction. That was not the case at all. There were problems right from the start with broken promises, incorrect measurements, a breech of our bank account information involving the police department due to our paperwork and personal check being dropped in the street, wrong materials ordered and delivered, poor workmanship, damaged and incorrect cabinets, incorrectly fabricated granite, damaged and destroyed new appliances, workmen not showing up when promised, the list goes on and on. It's been over a year since we first met with the designer, and over nice months since the gutting of the area first occurred, and we are just now getting the final replacement cabinet doors, of which one was still blemished. Our remodel has been the laughing stock of our neighborhood and we will be finishing parts of the job ourselves. This has ended up being, what we call, ""The most expensive do-it-yourself project ever."" Even with the overall design being very nice, we see constant reminders of how badly everything progressed."
5,"When planning to remodel our kitchen we never thought that our Dream Kitchen could come into fortition this AMAZING. Sarah Kraus literally saw our vision from the minute we started to talk.  She listened to our ideas, was attentive to  our needs and circumstances, thoughtful in not only the work she does but goes the extra mile to get to know the client , organized as well;  if you were to request a copy of anything she has it readily available.  This process really does set the customer up for true comfortability during the crazy process of redesigning a kitchen.  The time line presented was reasonable and finished well around the time given.  The team that worked with her, Brian_ Project Manger, David- carpenter and the other fields contracted in to assist with the job were always professional and considerate.  The kitchen design is beautiful, simply breath taking.  Every detail we discussed and designed were delivered. The craftmanship that was taken into our stair railings is UNBELIEVABLE.  They brought our Pinterest idea to life, with of course a some designing ideas from Sarah !  We have done many remodels with contractors and this by far was our best experience.  I highly recommend Sarah at S&WKitchens.  She is very talented and TOP NOTCH!"
5,"We used S&W Kitchens for our total kitchen and foyer renovation.  We literally changed everything from our floor to ceiling in each room.  S&W handled every aspect of our remodel.  They handled everything from demo, plumbing, electrical, flooring, ceiling removal and all of our kitchen cabinets are custom made perfectly for our kitchen.  Our granite is absolutely gorgeous and looks like the ocean it fits perfectly with our home decor, colors, etc.  Each employee who came into our home were very nice and respectful.  They cleaned their work space every time they worked at our home and also sent a cleaning service into our home to clean any dust that built up on our furniture during the demolition.  We have 2 dogs that loved the employees as well and it made the process even more enjoyable.  Our designer, Lacie, was absolutely in tune with that we wanted and was patient as we took our time to pick out each piece of backsplash, tile flooring, granite, lighting, etc. We are remodeling our dining room next and we are 100% sure we  are using S&W again for this renovation."
5,"My husband and I recently had our kitchen remodeled by S&W Kitchens.  We had new cabinets and countertops installed.  The entire team was  timely,  competent, and a pleasure to work with.  Our communication with the designer and site supervisor was excellent.  We were always aware of the status of the construction.  Being in the midst of covid,  the work teams had temperature checked and face masks on during their time in my home.  We highly recommend S&W Kitchens."
5,After many many searches for a vanity we went with S & W kitchens my designer Sarah Kraus walked me thru the process.  The vanity had to custom designed for the space needed.  They vanity is beautiful the staff at S & W are wonderful I would recommend them to all my friends ❤️
5,"After searching 3 years for a good company to help me remodel my master bathroom, I finally found the perfect company.  S&W Kitchens did an excellent job!  They have excellent designers, project managers, and a great team who completed the job on time (even during the summer of Covid 19), on budget, and the final result exceeded my expectations!  What else could you ask for?  I will definitely be using them again in the future and highly recommend the team out of Melbourne, Florida.  Special thanks to Lindsey and Dale for making this such a positive experience!"
5,"We've just completed a project with S&W Kitchens.  They're ""not just kitchens!""  We began with several planning conversations with Carol in their showroom and in our home.  She was helpful all the way, asking all the right questions, providing sketches as the plan came together.  It was no small task: removing the tub, removing wall tile, re-directing the plumbing and drain, installing new tile on the walls and floor, new shower fixtures, a corner seat, grab handle, and sliding glass shower doors.  The end result is beautiful with nothing being damaged along the way.  All of the materials are top quality, all of the craftsmen were skilled, pleasant and knowledgeable, working under the careful eyes of Carol and of our superintendent, Pete who scheduled everything masterfully, communicating each day resulting in minimum disruption of our household.  We were so impressed with their work we asked them to undertake another project, new vinyl-plank flooring in our home office."
5,"We are very satisfied with our kitchen remodel with S&W Kitchens.  Our Project Designer, Mayerlin, was very helpful in getting us the right design for our needs & preferences.  Our Project Manager, Brian, was very thorough, straight forward, and always kept us up to date throughout the process regarding scheduling of electricians, plumbers, inspections, ordering etc.  We were never in the dark as to what was going on, which made us feel at ease throughout the entire process.  We highly recommend S&W Kitchens as they were great for us.  

Chris & Jo"
5,"My wife and I are extremely satisfied with services provided by S and W Kitchens during the complete remodel of our master bath. From design to completion, Sarah was accessible and attentive during the entire process. Was available for unscheduled site visits to verify design changes and the always unexpected issues by providing on site communication with the installers and stayed touch through the process. Most importantly the result came out the way we wanted. In many remodels the work can end up being what the contractor wants. Sarah listened to what we envisioned. A special thanks to Robert Ungavarsky, the superintendent for the project, for  handling and providing recommendations for issues as they came up and for the addons we unexpectedly came up with.
We would highly recommend Sarah and her team at S and W."
5,"My husband and I recently undertook a major renovation of our kitchen, master bathroom, and guest bathroom.  We were extremely fortunate that we selected S&W Kitchens as our partner in this renovation.

Christina, our designer, was brilliant in understanding our goals and worked closely with us on color schemes, tile patterns, kitchen appliances, kitchen island space, bathroom hardware, and more!  From day one of demolition (thank you, Tony!) to the final day about nine weeks later, Mike, Christina, and everyone that worked to make our dreams come alive were exceptionally competent, responsive, professional, and friendly.  At the conclusion of our project, our kitchen and bathrooms were dramatically more beautiful (and highly functional) than we had imagined possible in our dreams.  

When you partner with S&W Kitchens, you collaborate with true experts.  I simply cannot adequately describe how well everyone, but particularly Christina and Mike, worked with us on all details, adjusting work schedules and “projects within projects” to come to completion smoothly, without glitches.

We also enjoyed this renovation project – all of the people involved were amazing to work with!  Anyone with a dream in mind would do well to contact S&W Kitchens to see that dream be realized.

5,"Moving from Texas to Florida was quite a challenge.  We wanted to be closer to our children and find a home to accommodate our 2 horses and 4 dogs.  The home we found was ”A 
diamond in the rough”!  The only thing it had going for it was the lovely trees in the front yard, enough acreage for the horses and a move in ready barn.  
The day I walked into S and W kitchens and met Laura Scott was my best day since moving to Florida.  My kitchen (and the rest of the house) was not functional and so, so outdated. I explained my dilemma to Laura, and thanks to her positive attitude, she said she was up for the challenge.  And what a challenge it was.  Not only was the existing kitchen design a challenge, I had already bought the new appliances for the new kitchen.  The transformation from old, dark and outdated kitchen to a new, bright, updated and perfectly designed kitchen is amazing.  Laura is an outstanding person a designer.  She is the best along with the rest of the S and W Kitchens crew.  
Our kitchen is perfect!  George and Jo Rosenhauer"
5,"My wife and I are extremely satisfied with the entire scope of services provided by S and W Kitchens during the complete remodel of our kitchen. From the initial design to the final cabinet trim, Sarah remained accessible and attentive during the entire process. This included, but was not limited to effectively dovetailing our vision with her design expertise, site visits for design consultation and measurements, and subsequent verifications prior to ordering, on site communication with the installer and staying in touch through the entire process. From working with us to find the perfect slabs for the counter tops to helping us select our appliances we highly recommend Sarah Kraus and her team at S and W."
5,"We had a total kitchen remodel done by S&W. Rosemarie Szedula was our designer, she did a fantastic job from start to finish. She was ever present and kept everything on time and on track. Her design and features were wonderful, she had many great ideas that we love."
5,"We recently had a bathroom, kitchen and bar area renovated by S&W Kitchens. We entered a project of this scale with some trepidation, but overall the whole process went smoothly and we could not be happier with the outcome.  Designer Lindsey Schwartz and superintendent Dale Thomas were diligent in the planning of the project such that each aspect was scoped out in detail before they started.
Lindsey was always a pleasure to work with, knowledgeable about overall design elements as well as available products, and always responsive to messages. She was able to guide us through making style choices without imposing her personal preferences. Dale was always on top of the project, available to meet to discuss details, and had the knowledge and foresight to avoid problems that might occur. 
All of the personnel, including the construction workers were diligent and courteous. 
All in all, we are incredibly pleased with our renovations both aesthetically and from the quality that went into them. We would work with S&W again in a heartbeat."
5,S &W are wounderful people to work with. They are extremely professional we did had some minor problems but they took care of any problem that popped up.  They did suggest an appliance person that i used and they are helping me where the appliance company wont. Not there fault. The appliance company has some deal with a warranty company called dish do not use the dish warranty. But again Dale and Mike are awesome to work with.
5,"Roisin Wong, our project manager at S&W Kitchens, was simply fantastic! She guided me through the entire process of renovating our kitchen from start to finish: layout, cabinet selection, lighting, countertop and backsplash and installation. She is professional, patient, friendly, talented and incredibly helpful! She knew our budget and gave several options to help me stay within that budget. She asked questions and made suggestions based on the way we use our kitchen. As it is the most important room in our home, she helped me put together a space that is light, bright and welcoming. Most important, she designed a space that completely fits the design of our home! I wholeheartedly recommend Roisin Wong."
5,"I had an excellent, gold-star experience with S&W Kitchens. My designer, Fred, was outstanding and went above and beyond to strategize ideas for accomplishing my bathroom remodeling goals. His creative solutions to my needs were wonderful! S&W is a first class company that employs first class, top notch employees. Everyone on the team was professional, cordial, friendly, knowledgeable, and fun to work with. I enjoyed working with them on a first name basis  and getting to know them a bit. I found them earnest and hardworking. They treated me not only as a client, but a real human! I would recommend anyone interested in S&W's services to contact them!"
5,"After sourcing many companies and meeting with designers, I made the final decision to hire S&W for a complete remodel of our very outdated 23 yr old kitchen. There wasn’t a designer I met, that I was more comfortable with then Roisin Wong. We met with over 10 local companies and two from out of the area, I was drawn back to S&W based solely on my interaction with Roisin, her compassion, patience, & level of expertise proved to be the right choice.  Throughout the entire project I had my share of panic attacks and once again, Roisin eased my fears, concerns and Michael addressed any issue or complaints I had. Overall, the kitchen is amazing, the layout gave us additional space, something I thought would be impossible. Everyone who comes into our home, gives us endless compliments as to how beautiful our kitchen is. I cant thank S&W enough for the professionalism and outstanding quality of work. I would definitely recommend their services, coming from someone who’s had their share of horrible contractors."
5,"We really disliked our kitchen at one time, and decided to do something about that by hiring Sarah of S&W who came highly recommended.  The transformation to our new kitchen is amazing! Not only does it look beautiful, but it is very functional and we now have more storage with a very important new coffee station. Sarah gave us a kitchen with a purpose and so aesthetically pleasing! We have received many compliments. We love it and enjoy every second!!! Sarah truly brought our vision to light! Thank you Sarah!!"
5,"We have done 2 renovations with S&W (master suite and kitchen plus flooring throughout house) and have been thrilled. Laura is a gifted designer who just ""knew"" what I would love - she was right AND professional down to the last detail.  Dale and crew are experts and dedicated craftsmen.  I enjoy working with them all and would NEVER consider using anyone else."
5,"My wife and I heard about S&W kitchens from our friends at Real Radio 104.1.  After doing a little homework of our own, it was a rather easy decision to go with them for our kitchen renovation.  We weren't planning on remodeling our kitchen however due to a leak in our old dishwasher we were forced into the situation.  At first, we were somewhat concerned with the timeframe, budget, and the quality of product we would be able to afford.  My wife had a vision in her mind of what she wanted the kitchen to look like.  Fortunately, we ended up working with an amazing designer at S&W Kitchens, Sarah Kraus.  Not only was Sarah able to offer us several high-quality options within our budget, but she also worked diligently with us to provide an itemized list of the products and services that were in scope for the renovation which was required by our insurance provider.  We met with Sarah personally in the S&W showroom as well as in our home on several occasions and she worked around our busy schedule to accommodate us.  Once the design was completed and construction was underway, Sarah made sure to keep us informed on what work would be done and by whom.  As with any major construction project, there are always a few hiccups along the way.  What impressed me the most about Sarah and S&W Kitchens was the confident reassurance that they would take on any unforeseen issues in stride and ensure the job was done not only to meet our requirements but also to meet their standard of excellence.  Sarah was easy to communicate with by phone, e-mail and in person to discuss any concerns.  With little to no delay she provided us with a remediation plan each time as well as a follow-up to ensure any and all issues were taken care of.  In the end, my wife and I are extremely happy to say that our kitchen is now picture perfect, and with the customized personal design, our house feels even more like our home. A big thanks to Sarah and the rest of the S&W team that made it all happen."
5,"Our master bath remodel was our second project with S&W. Once again we are delighted with the results. Not only is our new master bathroom gorgeous, it is efficient and functional. No more clutter on the counter or in the shower. Everything is hidden away while still being conveniently within reach. The construction team addressed every detail, resulting in the flawless execution of the design. They were courteous, professional and respectful at all times. 

We worked with designer Laura Scott as we had on our kitchen project. Her approach is collaborative and we knew she would help us bring our vision to life. She listened to our needs and desires and then offered fresh ideas that complemented ours. We appreciate how she touched base with us frequently from design to completion. 

Bottom line, we recommend S&W and would definitely use them again."
5,"I recently finished a renovation of my kitchen and laundry room with S&W kitchens. I had used them before for my master bathroom.
I highly recommend them. It was a very professional job.
Of course the process wasn’t completely smooth but at every turn they came up with a good solutions to any problems encountered .
Krista Agapito my designer and Pete Coffman my construction manager were excellent. Krista’s design made my kitchen and laundry room much more functional and beautiful too. Pete was great with keeping me informed everyday with what was to happen; which I greatly appreciated. Pete was also excellent with solving problems along the way.
I what definitely recommend the whole team at S&W Kitchens ."
5,"We have used S&W for both our kitchen and master bath. We are very pleased with both projects. The workmanship and professionalism of all the trades was top notch. 
We feel the leadership and involvement of Robert Ungvarsky, the contractor and Mary Burkhammer, the designer, insured a positive experience. 
Robert’s daily involvement and communication kept us current throughout the process. That was greatly appreciated."
5,"We hired S &W for our master bath remodel after online research. Kristin (designer)  performed a thorough in house courtesy consultation with very accurate measuring. We met at their Windermere location for  a 3D, no pressure presentation and obtained an estimate. Once we committed to the project  we got introduced to Robert Ungvarswky our project manager.  From that moment on he was in charge on scheduling and keeping us informed of  day to day progress mostly via txt message with real time pictures . We encountered some unexpected work order changes but remained confident on their ability and disposition of finishing our project and meet our high expectations   We are happy with our final product and reassured that we can always contact them for any questions since they use reputable local companies And high quality materials,  Robert showed great professionalism and was available to address all our questions which made the process less stressful. I would recommend S&W to friends in the future"
5,"Review for S&W Kitchens WINDERMERE location.
Necessary bathroom renovation (LAKE NONA) to make shower larger with wide door and ability to roll-in wheelchair when necessary.  Removed tub to expand shower area and elongate sink wall which gave much more storage space.  Wasn't planning this project, but became a necessary project for medical reasons, and couldn't have gone more smoothly.  If you are really price shopping, this probably isn't the group for you.  But if you have enough going on in your life already and want to know that the team is going to do the project properly and not cut corners, and be there when they say they will be there, then Robert and James are the team for you.  You will pay more, but I have seen some questionable construction around here but not with these guys.  Everyone was on point, the design, the construction, tilers, electricians, plumbers, paint/drywall.  If any construction project could ever be considered great, this was it.  It was a pleasure to welcome every member of this construction team into our home and if it ever becomes necessary again, I won't even consider anyone else."
5,"I highly recommend this Contractor.  I hired them on word of mouth, and they've done 2 bathrooms in a home which I just sold, and we are on our third now, in my home!
I am working with Shirley and Eric, and their professionalism is impressive.  Construction is, by nature, chaotic, messy, and noisy.  They minimized all these factors, and I am able to let go, and let them handle it every time. When it is time to do another, they will do it!"
5,"S&W Kitchens (Melbourne, FL office in particular) is a great company to work with, and Laura Scott is a wonderful designer. 

I hired them to remodel our 35 year old kitchen and had no clue where to begin. Laura walked us through the planning process with great patience and ease (and cheerful demeanor) beginning with an assessment of what we currently had and what we were hoping to accomplish in the finished design. With that understanding of our needs she worked up several proposed configurations and presented them to us as 3D and 2D presentations. Then she guided us through the material selection process for color, style, and mechanical configuration. Once we were satisfied with all that, she worked up a final plan including a detailed List of Materials and work plan. 

During that process we also met with Dale (construction lead). Together they laid out a timeline for the construction giving us a time window of best case and worst case duration. For the most part, they hit the timeline as promised and finished within the original prediction window.

The work crews were polite and friendly. We felt very comfortable having them around the house (no security concerns.) They answered any questions we had while they worked and during the job progress. They worked carefully and kept the house as clean as possible by removing construction debris each day and hauling it away (no dumpster in the driveway!). Floors were protected with heavy-duty cardboard mats that were taped in place to prevent damage. Our hardwood floors came through the process without damage. We used plastic drop-cloths over everything each day to shield from dust. (It's inevitable that dust gets everywhere. Buy a stock of A/C filters and plan on changing them out every day or at least every other day during demolition and early phases of the construction, especially if drywall work is going on.) They can also place plastic sheeting to close off rooms as much as possible but the circulating air carries a lot of dust around the house nonetheless.

Measurements were taken of our kitchen on at least two occasions ('measure twice, cut once' theory) so as to be sure they were correct. However, we still ended up ordering a special cabinet in one position as the one cabinet was too wide for the location because they ordered the wrong size. 

The quartz countertop fits perfectly. Alignment and seam work are exceptional. I couldn't find the seam until my wife pointed it out to me. The quality of the back-splash tile work is also exceptional. The installer meticulously hand fit pieces around the difficult areas. After the cabinets were installed, Laura inspected them and ordered replacement bits for anything that was scratched or dinged or had questionable surface finish. They cabinet installers adjusted all the drawer slides and cabinet hinges for proper operation.

They had first indicated that they would stage all the materials in their warehouse and then bring them over, then we discussed storing them in the garage, but we were concerned about humidity issues and bugs, but in the end the materials were all staged in our family room. (We moved everything into the other rooms to make room for the materials. It had two benefits: first, it was adjacent to the kitchen so it made work efficient and easy; secondly, all materials were under A/C and so all dimensions stabilized in the wooden parts prior to installation. It was inconvenient for us because of the crowding but it was probably the best solution in the end.)

It is inevitable that remodeling is inconvenient. However, S&W Kitchens did their best to make everything flow smoothly. We are very pleased with the finished result and I easily recommend S&W Kitchens and Laura Scott for anyone seeking to remodel their kitchen."
5,"The team at S & W of James, Robert, and Aniko did an outstanding job of design and build with our kitchen remodel/renovation.  They managed the entire project from start to finish.  They kept us in the loop throughout and the project was on track from the beginning.  The final results are incredible, beyond expectations, and we are very happy.  We would recommend S & W and this team if you're considering any type of kitchen or home remodel.  We will surely use them again for our next project!  Thanks again!"
5,"Thank goodness for S&W Kitchens! My husband and I had had bad experiences with renovations and contractors in the past and were beginning to think that there was no such thing as a good contractor. Luckily, we found S&W Kitchens. Whitney Rutledge immediately understood our style and knew what we were after from a design standpoint. She planned out our kitchen renovation for maximum utility and suggested features that brought our kitchen renovation to a whole new level. We are thrilled with what she and her team accomplished and we couldn't be happier!  We definitely recommend Whitney and S&W Kitchens for any project. You won't be disappointed!"
5,"We bought a fixer upper condo on the beach. We had heard so many horror stories of remodels gone bad. We hired S&W because of their great reputation for customer service. We were not disappointed. Lindsey Schwartz was our designer.  We did a complete remodel of master bath and kitchen and minor remodel on the two guest baths. She clearly knows what she is doing and was a pleasure to work with. We were impressed with the quality of work and how easy it was to work with S&W. All workers are given  background checks.  This was important to us because our condo was not going to be livable during construction. Dale, the construction superintendent, was great. He impressed our condo Board of Directors.   We needed their approval to proceed, so this was important. We did not get nickeled and dimed  to death. The price in the contract is what we paid. Every Friday, I received an email from Lindsey with photos on progress for the week and plans for the next week. 

 Everyone who has seen our remodel is totally impressed. They are a high end remodeler and you will be happy you hired them."
5,"Whitney worked with us for several months to find exactly the look we wanted for flooring, backsplash, paint, countertops. IT turned out better than we could have imagined! Mike managed the construction and was very responsive to our requests and change orders. Thanks Mike and Whitney!!"
4,"S&W Kitchens delivered on my kitchen remake. It was a long and tedious process, but construction manager, Pete, was on top of it all. When things didn't work out, he moved in and got it right. Especially the wonderful company, The Groutsmith, who worked wonders in my   kitchen backsplash tile.  Thank you Pete, and S&W!!"
5,It was a great experience working with Lacie Rice from S&W Kitchen in South Tampa.   They took great care of us and the end result is a stunning a high quality Poggenpohl kitchen.  Recommend S&W to anyone.
5,"We worked with S & W to remodel our master bath.  Working with Carol our designer was a pleasure.  She made us feel comfortable and valued.  Our project manager, Pete was easy to work with and kept us updated on the project and let us know when to expect workers on a daily basis.  Carol and Pete and the whole S & W team were always respectful of us and our home.  We could't be happier with the finished  project.  Would highly recommend working with this company!"
5,"I chose S&W Cabinets to redo my kitchen. Shirley and team from GC (Mike) to all the individuals that performed the many tasks were great and highly professional. They kept me informed and as the project progressed. Mike even made sure that I had a functional kitchen as soon as they could, since this project occurred during the holidays.
I love my new kitchen so much I’m having them redo my master bath. Looking forward to this project."
5,S & W did a great job and we are 100% pleased with our beautiful outdoor kitchen! Working with Yina was a pleasure and we highly recommend her - she was always available and totally responsive to all of our needs.
5,"I totally LOVE the way my kitchen came out.  With the assistance of Laura at S&W, it is my dream kitchen that I waited 21 years for.  I love to cook and this kitchen makes me want to do more.  I will post pics at a different time.  I had my colors in mind, but the selection and staff were great.  Will definitely use them again, most likely in bath room."
5,"I had been planning and visioning my outdoor living area for a couple of years before finally pulling the trigger. I had numerous companies come out to provide designs and quotes to best accomplish my ideas. I chose Sarah with S & W Kitchens to move forward with my project because I was impressed with her background and willingness to research ideas that she had not done before. The work went as scheduled, the job was clean and everyone friendly. When the project was complete, it was exactly what I had envisioned and I could not have been happier. I have been described as very particular and have frustrated contractors on previous projects with my expectations. The team at S & W did not bat an eye and made sure that everything was completed exactly to my request. I would highly recommend Sarah and S & W Kitchens for anyone that is in the market for an upgrade or an addition to their living area."
5,Mayerlin at S&W Kitchens was our designer for our kitchen remodel  She was very professional and very easy to work with.  She took the time to make sure our needs were met within our budget.  Everything was done on time and our kitchen turned out beautiful!  I highly recommend Mayerlin and S&W Kitchens.
5,"S&W Kitchens redid our kitchen and replaced all our tile flooring in the house.  Designer Jaime was patience itself as he helped us select product, guiding us to the price, quality, and styles that we were interested in.  He accommodated our schedule for meetings at home and at the show room.  Project supervisor Austin kept us informed through every step of the process.  He communicated with us every single day, most days in person as he stopped by to check on the work.  If not in person, then on the phone.  If I needed to call him, he always answered my call.  All the workers did great work, were polite and efficient.  I would most definitely use S&W Kitchens again."
5,"The S&W team lead by Krista was phenomenal to work with during our entire process. She, Mollie, and Haleh from the Winter Park location were intuitive, creative, and had follow through after every meeting. They gave clear direction and recommendations. Dale, their specialist that did the install was professional, polite, and very talented in making any needed adjustments to  our cabinets. There's nothing better than working with experienced people that actually listen when we're investing in high quality cabinets with smart designs. I would 100% recommend them for any design needs."
5,"We had managed several home renovation projects in our previous home and we were reluctant to start another one in our current home knowing the time commitment and the disruptions to your life.  As a result, we thought we would start with a small project of replacing our kitchen cabinet doors.  Our research brought us to S&W Kitchens.  After our initial meeting and learning they were a full service company, we decided to switch projects and move forward with the renovation of one of our guest bathrooms.  Once we connected with Lacie Rice in the South Tampa office, we loved the entire process!  She was amazing to work with and had great design ideas.  The S&W process was fantastic – Lacie and Mike (construction foreman) facilitated everything for us from design, demo, renovations, and inspections.  Lacie reviewed every finish/detail, budget and calendar with us up front.  The timeline was accurate and the project was completed on time and within budget.  Lacie and Mike were awesome to work with during the project – they were very communicative and were great with our dog.  We did not worry about a thing – it was the smoothest renovation project we have ever had!  The finished product is beautiful – we love the new bathroom and our family does too!  We highly recommend using S&W for anyone that is contemplating any house renovations.  We will be using S&W on our next project.  Thank you Lacie, Mike and S&W Kitchens!"
5,"We started out with the intention of hiring a contractor to perform a  modest kitchen renovation (replacing cabinet doors and countertops), but even that proved to be daunting as we needed to manage and schedule each trade separately.  Then we found S&W Kitchens.  S&W acts as the general contractor and handles everything from design to renovation and appliance installation. 
Our modest kitchen renovation mushroomed into a whole house makeover – we replaced everything in the kitchen (including the appliances which we ordered through S&W), added new wood flooring throughout the house, renovated a bathroom, added crown molding, built out a new pantry, and more.  
Lacie in the south Tampa office was fantastic throughout the design and construction process.  She spent countless hours with us not only in her shop and in our home, but also accompanied us to our numerous visits to varied locations to select our countertops, plumbing fixtures, electrical fixtures, etc. Eric was the construction foreman on our project and was likewise great to work with.  We couldn’t be happier with the finished product and would definitely recommend S&W to anyone contemplating a home renovation project, large or small."
4,"Everyone I came in contact with was professional, patient and knowledgeable, including the subcontractors. Workmanship was good and communication was timely and clear.
I would recommend this company as long as u don't mind paying a little more."
5,"When we decided to do a complete teardown and redo of our kitchen, we knew we needed a full-service company that would manage the process, start to finish. We definitely got that with S&W Kitchens.  They took care of every detail and gave us a new kitchen that exceeded our dreams and expectations. 

We knew we needed a designer that we would feel comfortable working with. Our designer, Laura Scott, listened to us and completely understood our vision. She used her design know-how and considerable talent to pull together a kitchen that is not only beautiful, but incredibly efficient as well. There is nothing better than function meeting form and she definitely achieved that for us.  She was attentive to our project throughout the process, checking to make sure all was going well.  She went with me to the slab yard and patiently viewed all the countertop options to narrow down the selection.  I really appreciated her helpful suggestions and support during the selection process.  Picking out the color palette and the various materials for the kitchen was a breeze with her guidance.  Looking at the result, we would not change a thing. 

We were impressed with the S&W planning process where no detail was overlooked. A great deal of attention was given to planning, which we believe is a large part of the success of the project. S&W provided us with full documentation, including all of our decisions, plans and diagrams for the crew, and the sequence of events that would take place over the course of the project. The project stayed on track with only minor delays, resulting in a fully functioning kitchen by the promised end date.

Our project manager, Dale Thomas, is highly skilled at managing a project.  Not only did he keep the project moving, he used exemplary problem solving skills to resolve issues that came up along the way.  He elicited excellence from his crew, trade contractors and vendors.  Observing him in action, we came to trust that we were in good hands with Dale and crew.
Friends had warned us that a kitchen redo of this magnitude would be a horrible experience.  But S&W made it as painless as possible. Before tearing down the kitchen, they moved our refrigerator to the dining room so that we could set up a temporary kitchen to use during construction. They were thoughtful of our comfort throughout the process, keeping disruption to a minimum. The crew was friendly and considerate. They cleaned up at each step of the process and hauled away multiple trailers full of debris. They hooked up our washer and dryer early on to allow us to do laundry at home as soon as possible.  Long story short, the experience was far less disruptive than we expected.  

In a word, S&W stands for excellence.  We are glad we went with them and would definitely use S&W again in the future."
5,"I have worked together with Matt Carpenter on multiple occasions now and would highly recommend him to anyone in need of a professional cabinet designer.  His projects always run smoothly from start to finish and his ability to incorporate amazing design features is second to none.  Keep up the great work Matt, I look forward to the next one!"
5,"Just completed a major renovation (kitchen, bath, laundry room and fireplace) with S&W Kitchens. I choose S&W because of a recommendation from a friend and neighbor and to avoid all the “night-mare” kitchen remodeling stories I have heard over the years.  S&W came through for us and it was a stress-free remodeling project. Our S&W designer, Mary Burkhammer took the time to understand our design goals and vision and added the detail to turn our dream into a real plan and design. My husband is a detail-oriented engineer and he was greatly impressed by the S&W design and build process. Our construction foreman, Robert Ungvarsky turned the design into a reality.  They send master craftsmen across all the trades to complete your project. Believe me, you will not find this level of craftsmen in the yellow pages. I’m so satisfied with their work, I will be calling S&W to remodel my master bath."
5,"I am an interior designer in Orlando, and I have worked with Matt Carpenter on several of my projects.  The experience has been nothing but positive.  Matt is easy to work with and creative as well.  We have worked on large custom jobs as well as more simplistic projects.  The result has always been the same, total customer satisfaction and ease of execution.  I would certainly recommend them for your cabinetry job.

4,Lacie and Eric were great to work with.  Lacie was told that I was not a shopper and to select 3 options from which to choose.  Everything she put forth was spot on and in keeping with what I was looking for.  Eric came and saved the day after a bit of a glitch with the original onsite leader.  Eric was able to make sure the project was on track and worked very closely with Lacie to ensure a quality deliverable.  I really enjoyed working with both Eric and Lacie. They are both very professional and care about doing what is right for their client.
5,"I have worked with Matt Carpenter many, many times over the years as an industry professional. He has designed everything from full custom kitchens to display vignettes for my customers.   He is an expert in his craft, acting as both a very talented designer (one of the few who will still hand sketch out a rough design to give a customer a visual) and as a true consultant to his customers, taking in to account their budget and lifestyle and thinking through all of the little details that will give them their perfect end result.  He's a true professional, and a pleasure to work with!"
5,If you are looking for a company to do a complete kitchen renovation look no further.  These folks have amazing ideas and are easy to work with.  Bill and Tim were both friendly and knowledgeable.  I am very please with the outcome of my kitchen remodel.
5,"I have had three remodeling jobs done by Bill and Tom of S & W Kitchens in Longwood, Florida. One bathroom and my kitchen were totally removed and rebuilt.  The other bathroom was basically refreshed with old wallpaper removed new flooring, bathroom hardware, vanity, mirror and fresh paint. Bill provided the decorating expertise while Tim supplied the project planning, supervision and selection of fantastic craftsman. My kitchen had some layout issues that compromised its utility.  These utility issues were completely resolved and I was left with a much more useable space.  All three spaces always receive compliments from my guests. I recommend the pair to anyone considering remodeling."
5,"S & W kitchens did a great job for us.  Replaced all our cabinets and we love them.  We found working with them a joy, all the workers were very professional and friendly.  I would recommend them anytime.  Working with Lindsey, my designer was great!"
5,"Having endured several competitors, we would go as far as saying Matt and his team at S+W are one of the most proficient and professional Cabinetry businesses we have come across. With x5 Bathrooms and a Laundry room to fit in our new build, the choices, design options and eventual outcome was exactly as we wished for.
Thank you Matt.
George + Rita Brewster"
5,"I bought a house on bayshore 2 years ago and decided to totally remodel the whole kitchen.  After interviewing a few designers, we settled on S&W.  This is a totally honest review and anyone is welcome to come see our amazing kitchen. The design of the kitchen was amazing.  Wolf and Subzero appliances, great layout, beautiful counters, cabinets and flooring.  It's been a year and we are still amazed at how well it came out. Larissa was our designer in the Tampa office and she is totally gifted. Our foreman was John and he kept us up to date through out the project. The subcontractors were pros as well.  The price was agreed upon upfront and that didn't change even though there were some changes along the way."
5,"We chose Sarah at S&W because of her design ideas, listening, and understanding what effect and style we wanted to achieve.  She has been wonderful to work with--very talented with lots of great ideas.  We realize we're not always easy to work with, but Sarah has been wonderful throughout the project."
5,This is the 2nd phase of our kitchen remodel. Kristin Rutkowski and S&W crew were very professional in meeting our needs. Our Project Manager Robert Ungvarsky kept us up to date on crews coming in to work on our house. They were very professional and listened to our needs and requests.  We love the new change updates such as moving Washer and Dryer and placing additional Cabinets into our Galley Kitchen Design.  Love the extra space.  Thank you Kristen and Robert for a very good experience .
5,Couldn’t be happier with the job Matt Carpenter did for me on our latest project. Professionally managed from beginning to end. Highly recommended!!!!!
5,"We contracted S&W Kitchens to do our kitchen remodel and we are super happy with their work. Kristin Rutkowski was our designer. She presented to us great choices for countertops, backsplash, and fixtures that worked well together and were stylish. Pete Coffman, our project superintendent, was always on top of every detail and made sure we knew what was going on every step of the way.  The workers were reliable, knowledgeable of their craft, polite, and took pride in their work. We are so glad S&W did our kitchen and we highly recommend them!"
5,"Worked with Kristin Rutkowski at The Expo Design Center. Very talented and professional. If you are needing a good and competent designer, you are in good hands!"
5,"We needed a complete kitchen and master bathroom renovation and after 3 quotes for the job we selected S&W Kitchens. Whitney, Jeff and project supervisor Eric were all so professional, helpful and knowledgable. Whitney's help in everything from the design to the selection of cabinets, counter tops and matching tile to existing flooring. The plumbing fixtures I had in mind she was able to match to a brand that fit our budget. 
All the workers were professional, friendly and cleaned up after they had finished working.
Our floors and furniture were well protected and the whole house was very clean when the project was completed.
Whitney was so pleasant to work with. She is very detail oriented and communicated with us throughout the project. We were kept informed of what and when the next phase was to happen and the project finished on time. There were no unpleasant surprises!
We highly recommend this company."
5,"I have worked on several homes with S&W over the last couple of years and the experience has been fantastic! Matt brings years of experience, knowledge, and creativity to make each and every project unique. I know when I bring a client here they are taken care of from start to finish because of Matt’s dedication to the project; from the initial sketches to detailed drawings to on-site meetings and installation. I will continue to bring my clients to Matt and the S&W team for their outstanding customer service!"
5,"After a previous kitchen project with S&W we were certain that they would be the ones to remodel our bathrooms. As expected, the same quality was delivered. Larissa was there every step of the way, creating a design that was what we had imagined and seeing every detail through to its final stages. Larissa's assistant, Yina and construction manager Mike were excellent and responded quickly to our questions. 
When looking for a company to remodel your home you want someone to trust and S&W is just that."
5,S&W were incredible.  Krista listened to what we wanted.  They provided a detailed set of drawings to review.  They changed the drawings until the design was perfect.  The budget was fixed and our family and S&W found ways to make it work.  Then the work began.  The team was professional.  The workmanship was at the highest level.  If the work was not as indicated on the drawings then it was reworked.  Changes happened and adjustments were made.  The project finished on schedule.
5,"Lindsey Schwartz and Savanna helped me update my kitchen. I wanted to keep my cabinets but add a new ""coffee bar"" and cabinet in one corner. I also chose new counter tops and back splash. The coffee bar area is wonderful and the cabinets fit the area perfectly. The match to the old cabinets is almost perfect. The new back splash makes the area brighter and more cohesive. The contractors were great and it was a pleasure to have them in the house. They kept to the schedule and did a great job."
5,"Sarah Kraus was our designer and liaison for the complete remodel of our master bath. She and Tim Hobson (contractor),  both with S& W Kitchens and Baths,organized and followed through with quite a complex project.
We had worked with Sarah before, remodeling 3 baths. She has an incredible work ethic and great ideas-also, she is a joy to work with!  We had a time constraint but all was complete on time and looks beautiful!"
5,"Integrated Kitchen ------ Lake Mary Fl

The kitchen renovation we have been planning for many years impacted almost our entire house.  We needed a contractor who would handle the project turn key and deal with all the trades.  
The team from S&W Kitchens did an amazing job.

First and foremost, Mayerlin Ferreira our designer was wonderful to work with. 
From the day we walked into the S&W showroom until our final completion she was fully engaged in our renovation.  
She looked closely at our tentative plans and listened to our intentions. The design choices that Mayerlin offered made our product selections easy. 
Our new integrated kitchen has all the features we desired and exudes extraordinary style.  

The project management team kept us informed on scheduling, inspections, and progress.  Considering the magnitude of the work, their realistic yet customer friendly communications kept us informed all the way through.

Finally, the trades(wo)men who performed the work were all professional and did high quality work.  This project was from ceiling to floor.  The drywall, paint, electrical, plumbing, tile, cabinetry, counter top and cleaning people all performed beyond expectations.

S&W Kitchens was certainly not the least expensive option.  
However, considering the magnificent results, we are extremely satisfied.  
We highly recommend S&W.

Sincerely
John & Janis P"
4,We started off great guns but then had a problem with the permit which put timeframes off quite a bit. Cleaned after each day. End product came out great and was totally satisfied with end results. Only concern I could voice is more communication. I like to know often what is going to happen next and when.
5,"The wife’s dream has finally come true! Thanks to S & W Kitchens, their designer Gayle McCaughin and superintendent Dale Thomas. Gayle designed our 33 year old kitchen into a very elegant fully functional space and Dale worked together with the various trades to minimize our down time! Everyone was very courteous and accommodating to our needs. We chose S & W because of Gayle’s design presentation, Dale’s quality assurance and the selection of cabinets and accessories. Also, the numerous positive reviews and that S & W had multiple locations in central Florida."
5,I had a design  that was perfect  for a loft place in my home but I could not find a co. to build it. Just happen to stop in S & W Kitchens and meet a designer named Mayerlin Ferreira. She was best person I had found to help with my project. She understood me was up front with cost and  it was a wonderful working experience. I would use her again for any project  in my home.
5,"I and my wife, Anne,  are most satisfied with our  kitchen cabinet project with S & W Kitchens. We appreciated working with Sarah Kraus from our 1st in-home meeting with her, our style and finish selections and installation experience. She answered our questions and addressed each concern. The whole experience was a very pleasant one."
5,"S&W, Longwood, did a fantastic job remodeling my condo. I had a basic idea of how I wanted my new kitchen to look; Greg Flassig’s design gave me more than I had thought possible. Greg listened carefully to how I wanted my kitchen to feel and he presented me with options that created my dream kitchen. Greg and his team paid careful attention to every detail. In addition to the kitchen, S&W removed and replaced my popcorn ceilings throughout with a knockdown finish. They installed new flooring and coordinated with my carpeting company with my painters to ensure a seamless completion. I will definitely use Greg and his team again and highly recommend them."
5,"We absolutely love our bathroom remodels (Master and Guest).  An outdated space was turned into our own personal spa.  Our designer, Sarah Kraus was a dream to work with.  A complete professional that helped us bring our vision to life making it nicer than we could have imagined.  We are busy professionals with hectic schedules.  Sarah, was considerate of our time and flexible with her schedule.  Remodeling can be stressful.  Sarah ensured we had a pleasant experience.  She has great vision and will help you make the most of any space."
4,"I absolutely love my new master retreat!  Thanks to the incredible design ideas of Sarah Kraus, I have an incredible master bedroom and master bath.  Sarah took a 1980’s bathroom with a huge tub and tiny shower and redesigned it into a luxury spa oasis.  I asked for a “wow” factor and she delivered.  The old tub area is now an incredible shower with a river rock floor, quartz seating and beautiful quartz and river rock shelving.  The shower wall with the window is framed in a unique tile that brings the beauty of the view into the room.  The cabinetry is elegant and functional with a ton of storage.  She turned a tiny shower into a linen closet and added a new dimension to the room by adding a barn door with a mirror.    The quartz waterfall, countertop, and shelving are a beautiful finish to an incredible space.  Sarah is very nice to work with and she listened to what I wanted and took my suggestions and designed the rooms to my personality.  If you are looking to transform a space into something special, Sarah Kraus is the person for the job.  You will not be disappointed in her artistic, creative abilities.  I would highly recommend her.   
The review would be 5 stars if I only considered the designer and the final product.  However, since this is a review for S&W Kitchens, I can only give 4 stars.   We had so many issues with our master suite remodel.  We went through 3 superintendents and the first 2 were not very organized and did not communicate with us.  We would show up expecting to see progress just to find out that things had not been done and no one bothered to let us know.  Even with the detailed instruction book, we had a lot of mistakes.  The tile folks used the wrong grout on the entire floor, added a step down into the shower and cut and tiled one wall so that everything was off center.   By the time Tim Hobson came into the picture, we were weeks behind schedule and completely frustrated.  Tim immediately started communicating with us and all of the mistakes were corrected and the job was completed.  S&W did provide additional work at no cost to make up for the mistakes that were made during the renovation.  Sarah's design and choice of products deserves a 5+ star rating."
5,"Sarah was magnificent. She worked tirelessly to ensure the bathroom design we were looking for translated into exactly what we wanted. Her suggestions and recommendations were always with our best interests in mind. She maintained regular communication to keep us ""in the loop"" and aware of any work schedule changes.

Sarah had a great eye for detail and was extremely knowledgeable of all pertinent bathroom-related products. Her suggestions were based on knowledge, and not just guesswork. 

The finished product is nothing short of a thing of beauty and surpasses all we could hope for. We can't wait to show it off!

Thanks Sarah for taking the time to work with us. You did a fantastic job!"
5,changed a shower into a bathtub for the grandkids.  great designer and tileman.  a little pricey but got an high end quality product.
4,"Have worked with Andy Meeder with S & W Kitchens on several 
projects. He is a tremendous designer with a sharp eye.
A great talent. I hope we have many more together."
5,"We were fortunate to have Laura Scott and Dale Thomas create a gorgeous master bathroom for us where none existed before.  There wasn’t any existing plumbing and the electrical had to be totally redone as it wasn’t up to code.  We live in an old 1935 house and they turned what used to be a very small 10 x 5 enclosed front porch into a spa like retreat.  It definitely was an adventure as we encountered many stumbling blocks along the way as one does when challenged with renovating an old home.  You never know what you might uncover including a few extra layers of floors, extra layers of ceiling and extra layers of walls.  The original design would have been beautiful but because of all the adjustments we had to make the design morphed and developed along the way and it came out even better than the original plan and I wouldn’t change a thing or the process that got us here.  Laura was fabulous to work with and from the moment we met her we felt like we had known each other for years.  She was such a joy to work with and we felt that we were always on the same page when it came to coming up with materials or ideas.  She definitely got our vision.  I couldn’t have asked for a better team.  Dale our construction guru was incredible when it came to having awesome and unique ideas that fit perfectly with not only our style but the style of the house.  We kept having to change materials and adding and subtracting things and he was always so creative but always keeping in mind the era of the house and the fact that we were trying to stay true to that and we had a great time feeding ideas off of each other with the end result that the finished product was something we can all be very proud of.  I cannot thank the team at S&W Kitchens enough for not only giving us the master bathroom of our dreams but also for making the experience one we will always cherish.

1,"Hiring S and W Kitchens was possibly the worse decision I’ve made as a homeowner. The project was started in December and was to be completed by mid-April. It is now well into August and the work has yet to be completed. I was told by Larissa Berendsen that all the materials would be ordered prior to demolition, was I didn’t know was that much of what was ordered would be the incorrect size, color, or style. My foyer tile was installed three times before they used the correct tile. Bedrooms were all painted the wrong color. The wrong interior doors were ordered. The wrong interior hardware was ordered. The wrong laundry-room cabinets were ordered. The glass panels on the custom front doors were incorrect. Hardwood floors in all bedrooms were damaged upon installation and had to be ripped out and replaced. The kitchen lights continue overheat and cut-out after 20 minutes of use. On one occasion, my neighbors called to let me know that my front doors were left wide open without anyone on site for hours. I came home to find my doors unlocked at least five times. There is a lot more, but this gives you some idea. I met with the owner, Joe Steenbeke, two months ago to address these glitches and he assured me that the problems would be addressed, yet two months later, I am without a finished home. I saved for seven years to afford a home remodel, it is heartbreaking to know that I gave my money to people who care nothing about their customers."
5,We are extremely pleased with the remodel of our master bathroom.  Working with Lindsey and Dale was a pleasure. They were very professional and even when we ran into an electrical problem that was not their fault they helped us get the issue resolved and worked diligently with our condo association to help us move the project forward. We finished within the budget and love the new look.  I would highly recommend Lindsey and S&W.
1,"I hired S&W to remodel my master bath.  during the initial meeting, I was told it would only take 3-4 weeks, then when I went to sign the contract it stated 5-7 weeks. When I questioned the time I was told by the designer ""it's in all our contracts, but it won't take that long I promise"".  Then when the job manager came out to do the first look at the bath I was told it would take the full 7 weeks.  I questioned this with the designer and he said it probably would, so he lied!  We went through not having people show up to having inferior work done.  The tub had to be removed three times due to measurements not being correct, counter had to be removed due to wrong measurements, glass around shower had to be removed due to wrong measurements.  Each time it would take another week or two to get them back out. It finally took over 12 weeks to remodel a 10X12 bath. I called the owners and never received a call back. I wrote them and never heard a word. I have other issues but will just say I wouldn't recommed S&W for any project I'm doing."
5,"The, designer, Sarah Kraus, did an amazing job of helping me design my master bathroom. She showed me the whole process from start to finish. We went over each product that was going to installed in the bathroom. Since this is my first remodel of a room, I was overwhelmed with all the steps it takes and the process involved. Sarah showed me the process and the steps it takes to do the project. Without her help and guidance, I would be stressed over the project. Sarah is a true professional in that she has the knowledge and the ability to deal with my budget of the project. I would highly recommend Sarah Kraus as a designer for either your bathroom or your kitchen design."
5,Bill Burke was our designer and he did an excellent job transforming our kitchen into my dream kitchen! I would highly recommend S&W Kitchens to anyone!
5,"Could not be happier with S & W Kitchens.  Our kitchen renovation is a total success and mainly due to the efforts of our designer, Sarah Kraus.  She stayed on top of the progress being made every step of the way and kept us informed almost daily.  Since this was our first renovation this was very much apppreciated and would not hesitate to contact her again for any future plans.  Great job Sarah!"
5,Beautiful job on my bathroom.   Great designer and superintendent.  No complaints. Left my bathroom spotless.  All the workers were top notch.  Will definitely use S & W for my next project.  Kirsten worked very well with me.
5,"Worked with designer Lola Gainer and Construction Superintendent Eric Rodeback from Palm Harbor office.  They were very professional and great attention to detail.  Remodeled a condo kitchen when we were away, as this is a second home.  New cabinets, hardware, sink, faucet, flooring, tile backsplash, countertops, under cabinet lighting and appliances.  Completed on time and on budget.  Would highly recommend."
5,I find S&W Kitchens very professional and knowledgeable about their products. The prices are reasonable. The work is exceptional.
5,"My husband and I chose S & W Kitchens to design and remodel our 1983 kitchen.  I could not be happier.  We were treated with such respect and professionalism.  Our kitchen cost approximately 77,000 dollars and it was worth every cent.  Everyone went out of their way to make this experience go smoothly and it did!"
5,"S&W did a fantastic job on our kitchen renovation. Greg Flassig and everyone involved were highly professional, knowledgeable and respectful. We were kept informed every step of the way and we absolutely love everything about our new kitchen. Would highly recommend Greg and the S&W team!"
5,"My wife and I recently had one of our residential bathrooms totally demolished and renovated. We decided to use S&W Kitchens because they are local, have a reputation for a top quality finished product, and have been in business since the 1970's. 

Also, one of the main selling points for us was the designer, Sarah Kraus. Sarah developed the layout and basic design ideas. She discussed all the menu of products, designs, prices, colors, etc, and incorporated our preferences into a final design. My wife and Sarah worked very closely to coordinate each detail. 

Sarah is very thorough. She verified all the products necessary for the job, both at the warehouse and at our home before the renovation could proceed. She communicated with us daily and was always available to us when we called. 

The project finished slightly ahead of schedule and on budget. My wife and I are extremely happy with our new bathroom. S&W provided us with a professional team and they did a very professional job for us. 

But we cannot overemphasize the value Sarah Kraus played toward making this such a great success. She built the foundation with her attention to detail, keen eye for design, and quickly developing a free and open communications with my wife and me. Therefore, we give Sarah our highest recommendation."
5,From start to finish I was completely happy with the design team and contract team from the Palm Harbor office. Kristin Phillips made my kitchen the amazing centerpiece of the house. Thank you guys
5,"Bill is very knowledgeable  in all aspects of kitchen design!  I am on the radio with Bill quite often on a home improvement show and we have had many great discussions about kitchen design, the design process, the excellent teams of installers they use, etc.  I've spoken with some of his clients and have seen some of the kitchens they have designed that are just beautiful!    If you want to speak to the most knowledgeable kitchen designers in town, S and W Kitchens is the place to call!"
5,"Greg Flassig designed the renovation of our Master Bedroom bath.  We are thrilled with the outcome.  We wanted a ""roll in"" shower to accommodate our needs in our ""golden"" years.  Greg's design was both elegant and highly functional.  Greg was also very responsive to all of our concerns as construction progressed.  Great job!"
5,"We hired S&W Kitchens to renovate our Master Bath. Sarah Kraus was our designer.  Sarah was a joy and pleasure to work with.  From the beginning she really listened to our vision, our ideas and somewhat lengthy list of desires for our bathroom.  She was able to incorporate what she heard from us, saw in our way of living and personal design, to create a gorgeous, functional and unique Master Bathroom that we will enjoy and appreciate for many, many years to come. Our vision came to fruition with Sarah's amazing skills and artistic flair. Truly a dream collaboration. Sarah and the whole team; Chris, the superintendent, as well as all of the very skilled tradesmen were there for us through the entire process.  There were a few bumps in the road, as expected in a project of this size, but they responded quickly and did what it took from each of their perspectives to correct or overcome any issues that came up. Sarah became a friend through this process and I would not hesitate to recommend her and have her design our next project. I would also like to mention that all of the people we worked with throughout this project were first rate and a pleasure to talk to and work with. Their skills were evident which shows in the end result. We have a great deal of respect for everyone who participated in our project. Although slightly more expensive than other quotes, I believe it was well worth it, as S&W stands by what they do and deliver a quality product and service. We have already had someone ask if they can rent out the 'spa'!"
5,"I hired S&W Kitchens to do a whole house renovation. This included the kitchen, the master bathroom and the guest bedroom and floors.  They did a spectacular job of transforming a pig sty into a palace.  I worked with designer Krista and contractor Tim.  They made sure everything was done either on schedule or ahead of schedule and on budget. If there were any concerns each were easily reached by phone or text and the issue would be resolved post haste"
1,"Our experience was not a positive one.  When we went in for a final review of our plans there were several issues.  The designer left out several details that were very important to us, including the wrong size upper cabinets, which created other issues.  We were very clear about what we wanted and the designer's reaction was to blame us for making too many changes.  We feel changes are part of the process and so many would not have been necessary if our designer would have listened and not continually added their personal preferences into our design.  The worst part of the experience was when trying to finalize the design for a 2nd time, we were pressured by the manager to make a quick decision.  In the end we discontinued working with them and would not recommend them as we feel they were dishonest and did not deliver what they promised."
5,"We had a 20+ year old bathroom with ugly cracking tile and a jetted tub that was never used. We didn't know know exactly what we wanted, but knew what we did not want. Kristin showed us options we did not realize were  possible.  The end result is wonderful! The construction went smoothly. S&W clearly explained how the remodel would progress. Our new master bathroom is great!
We are currently planning our next renovation with S&W."
5,"S&W Kitchens did a total remodel of my 27 year old kitchen and brought it beautifully into the 21st century. My designer, Mary Burkhammer, was exceptional and was with me in every aspect of the design and construction. The S&W crew rolled like a well-oiled machine during the entire process. They were extremely knowledgable, professional, and dependable. This was a big project (building up walls, tearing up flooring, redesigning the footprint, adding new lighting and electrical outlets, re plumbing, etc) and it was totally STRESS FREE for me from start to finish! My new cabinets are of the highest quality as is everything used in the renovation project. Floor, countertops, back splashes, lighting, appliances, hardware - all top notch.  I couldn't be happier with the final results and would highly recommend S&W Kitchens to any one who wants a truly quality company!"
5,"Sarah Kraus from S & W Kitchens designed our beautiful Jack and Jill Bathroom. We found them a very professional firm and we're delighted with the final product. The project was completed on time which was wonderful. S & W Kitchens come highly recommended by us.

Mrs Rachel Miller"
5,"S & W Kitchens just designed and installed my beautiful, new kitchen. I am very pleased with the final product. Everyone is very professional and very quick to handle all questions and concerns. And though it was tough at times to be without a fully usable kitchen, S & W made the process less painful by staying on track. They actually completed the project a little ahead of schedule (Thank you, project manager, Tony!). I highly recommend them to everyone. And kudos to my designer, Jean for her attention to style and detail. Thank you S & W!!!"
5,"S&W kitchens did my design and remodel of my 23 year old kitchen. The design was fabulous and the remodel went perfect. Krista from S&W did the design and she really knows her craft. Very knowledgeable and understands all the different aspects of the construction process. She is very attentive and when she is not available she has a very capable right hand person (Whitney) that is ""Johnny on the Spot"". Bottom line, They do what they say they will do and they do it well. We are extremely happy with the end results."
5,"Outstanding! We have nothing but positive recommendations for Lindsey Schwartz at Brevard S & W Kitchens!

It all began with Lindsey listening to our wishes, then moved on to her designing and creating our condo kitchen, master bath, & guest bath renovation. Not only did she listen to what our desires were, but added so many great practical and decorative ideas, all the time keeping within our budget allowance. Lindsey & Kevin visited our condo to get ideas of what we wanted to do for the renovation, they spent time learning what we wanted, discovering what style kitchen, baths would suit us best with our renovation. Kevin measured everything to make sure what we decided to do would work for our space & meet our condo building code.

 We replaced our kitchen & bathroom cabinets, removed some walls, replaced  counters, sinks, lighting, mirrors, appliances, removed all popcorn ceilings replacing with textured ceilings, & had entire condo painted. With this being an ocean front condo, Lindsey designed our kitchen counter with a slight wave along the edge & added wavy tile backsplash to carry on the ocean wave theme using neutral Quartz stone with tiny seashells on top of white cabinets. It is just beautiful & quite the conversation piece!

Project manager, Dale was awesome to work with coordinating the entire project & managing all of the subs, plus doing a lot of work himself. The subs were all top quality & were all fantastic, from the cabinet installers, counter templaters,  painters, electrician, plumber, appliance installer, all took tremendous pride in their work. All kept very clean work space & thoroughly cleaned up space each day when they were finished.

We felt we were in good hands with our renovation from start to finish. Lindsey did not rest until she was sure we were happy with everything, no matter how small the detail. Not only was she knowledgeable in all areas, including electrical, plumbing, cabinetry, along with kitchen & bath design, she was a joy to work with. We highly recommend Lindsey & her team!"
5,We were pleased with the plans S&W drew up for the remodeling of our two  bathrooms.  Everything went smoothly with the work.  S&W personnel and contractors went out of their way to see that we were pleased.
5,"We were looking for a full service company to coordinate the work needed to update our  kitchen cabinets and two guest baths. We are very pleased with our decision to work with Nate Schuck, our project designer, and the team at S&W Kitchens. Nate listened to our needs, provided great ideas and worked within our budget. Travis Boley, our superintendent, coordinated the activities and was quick to respond to our questions. The quality of the products and service and the attention to detail was outstanding. We had an excellent experience and would highly recommend Nate and S&W Kitchens."
5,"Guidance throughout a stressful kitchen renovation.  Excellent choice of cabinets, colors & marble and granite & backsplash. Professional installation that has held up.."
5,"I contacted S&W Kitchens and spoke to Nate.  He came to my house and previewed the remodel of our guest bathroom.  We had been having major mold problems which drastically affected my wife's health.  We got three bids, but even though they were not the lowest, I was impressed with the way S&W personnel communicated with us.  We signed the contract to completely remodel the guest bathroom with Nate and set a date to commence the remodel with Nate and the Superintendent on the job Chris Hooper.  Because of the problem with mold they moved the work forward and started construction.  We were completely happy with the results and we would recommend S&W to anybody we know who; needs work done.  To us, first comes dollar cost and then communication.  I stressed this to all three contractors.  S&W was the only company to comply and stay in regular touch with us throughout the remodel.  Again, Nate, Chris and the people that did the remodeling were all outstanding.  Everybody that worked on our home was friendly, very knowledgeable, and took great care in the work they did."
5,"My name is Jack Flemm, i am  home owner in windermere, fl. I have had the extreme pleasure of doing two kitchens and three bathrooms with Nate Schuck. Each experience was better than the last, Nate is a real pro. He has an incredible eye for design, while always respecting my wallet, even when i do not!!! seriously, Nate is willing to speak his mind and work with your ideas. the first kitchen and two bathrooms were mostly his ideas and the second kitchen and one bath were mostly mine. i love them both. 
Nate, does a great job of making you, the customer, feel comfortable, while under promising and over delivering. at the moment, i have run out of projects, but i will always remember Nate Schuck when the next one shows up. You will love working with Nate and his team, i guarantee it."
5,Our designer was fabulous-Mary listened to our needs and planned the kitchen to what we were envisioning.  Tim was our project manager- he communicated beautifully and was very willing to listen when we had concerns.  The cabinets are gorgeous and installed perfectly.  We also loved the counter tops- beautiful.  Everything that was recommended to us- delivered.  Very pleased!
5,"The S & W Kitchen designer we worked with, Greg Flassig ,was very conscientious in helping us decide what materials and colors to use in our new kitchen remodel.  He gave us plenty of options, but did not overwhelm us.  He listened to our needs and wants, and was able to incorporate some fresh and innovative ideas into our living space without destroying the uniqueness of our home. Greg was very personable and patient, even when our decisions changed dramatically at the last minute when we added extra floor tile into our family room. The whole S & W team worked well together to finish the project on time, and they continued to be available when a few details needed to be redone after the project was completed.  We felt very comfortable with all of their workers and employees.  We highly recommend S & W Kitchens for quality service and distinctive designs."
5,We just used S&W to add a bathroom and they were awesome. They made an addition to the house adding a bathroom in our garage. The bathroom is beautiful and they finished ahead of schedule. I have a newborn and they were always so accommodating. They would call us to tell us who would be there the next day and when they would be there. The room was finished several weeks ahead of schedule and could not have come out better. We are so happy that we chose them!!
5,"S & W Kitchens Remodeled my kitchen; removed a wall, raised the ceiling, new cabinets and countertops; new plumbing and electric.
The designer assigned to me was Kirsten Phillips from the Palm Harbor location. She was WONDERFUL. She really listened to me. I was not present for the construction, however, she kept me informed every step of the way with calls, texts and pictures. Everything was finished to my complete satisfaction. Kirsten and the others went above and beyond to make sure that I was happy with my new kitchen.  I do not have one bad word to say about any of the people involved with my remodel. Do not hesitate to contract with this company"
5,"S&W completed a massive renovation for me in a most competent, efficient and timely manner.  Chris Druschel and Tim Hobson were my main contacts/advisors/designers, and working with them was truly a pleasure.  The project was completed on schedule, in my absence and with constant feedback and progress reports.  The quality of product and workmanship were extremely satisfactory.  

I am completely satisfied with the final result and would recommend S&W without reservation!"
5,"Adam from the Palm Harbor location came into our home in Brooksville and enlarged as well as completely remolded our kitchen.  We had used Adam and S and W previously, so we knew what to expect.  Adam and his team were on time and ready to go.  Project took less time than expected, and came in on budget.  Anyone looking for quality work needs to go to S and W."
5,"My wife and I were looking at doing a large renovation to our foyer, living room, gallery, moving the kitchen, laundry room, dining room, and two bath rooms. We talked to several companies before S & W Kitchens and after meeting with Chris Druschel, his ideas, the store, and meeting some of the management we were sold on S&W as the best people to hire. 
Working with Chris was a real pleasure and what a great design we as a team came up with.  The project once started went very smoothly from start to finish. All of the outstanding subcontractors were very professional and Tim Hobson ( construction project manager) worked the daily problems and kept everything on track The project was finished well ahead of schedule and we are extremely pleased with the quality of workmanship and attention to details that was put into beautiful restoration. S&W and all of the people involved in this project are highly professional, very talented and a real pleasure to work with.  
A very special thanks to Chris and Tim for an outstanding job. We couldn't be happier!"
5,"Lindsey did an awesome job in translating my concepts, descriptions, and examples of what I was looking for in my kitchen remodel.  While modern is not typical in Brevard, Lindsey was excited to do a project of that nature.  

The job consisted of new cabinets, countertops, and appliances.  While no walls were moved and the basic layout was retained, it was still a fairly extensive job.  

The entire S&W team were very professional and I was always kept up to date as to what was going to happen when.  There were very few issues that came up during the project.  The communication was always timely.  Whether it was Lindsey, the job foreman, or any subcontractors, they always communicated directly and honestly when any issues needed resolving and sought my input in determining solutions.  I felt that my satisfaction was their primary goal.  

The kitchen turned out fabulous and I would not hesitate to recommend them highly to friends.  I plan to update a bath in the near future and plan to give Lindsey and S&W my business when I do."
5,"As we embarked on a major remodel of our kitchen and both bathrooms, we were quite impressed with S&W’s design and materials selection. We tweaked the plans a bit, but only to accommodate our concerns about wear and tear in the kitchen as we use our kitchen a lot. S&W quickly made some changes in the materials and we were set to go! The materials selection process was a breeze. S&W narrowed down the material selections to two to three choices; which for us design-challenged types was very helpful. If we didn’t like any of the choices, they would bring in two or three additional choices.  
Throughout the entire process, S&W was very professional. Before any work started, we had plans, we understood the costs and we understood what would happen if we ran into unexpected snags. Enduring a remodel can be challenging, but a few things that we really appreciated were:
•Everything was resolved to our satisfaction. There was never any quibbling with anything we were not pleased with. 
•All workman and subs were very polite, conscientious and always cleaned up at the end the day….and when you’re living through a remodel, that’s very much appreciated.
•S&W is very responsive to calls/emails.
The project was completed in about three months and we couldn’t be happier. It turned out fantastic! We did go slightly over budget, however that was mostly due to changes/additions that we made. Since the remodel we’ve had a few little things break or require some adjustment, which S&W attended to right away, no questions asked.

We give S&W high marks. There were no surprises on cost, design, project timing, etc. They have a great price-value proposition and they are there for you during and after the project. So, without hesitation we highly recommend S&W!"
5,"Outstanding describes our experience working with Chris Druschel of S and W Kitchens. From the design stage through demolition, construction, and completion, Chris worked diligently to bring our unique vision to fruition. The quality of the materials and workmanship was of the highest order. At no time did we feel pressured to hurry the process. Deadlines were met. We would strongly recommend Chris Druschel of S and W Kitchens for any project."
5,"We decided to update parts of our home and met Chris at S & W Kitchens.   It was a pleasure from start to finish.    We had both bathrooms and kitchen cabinets refaced and quartz counter tops in both bathroom.    The work is perfect and we were so happy we decided this year to have the kitchen counter top replaced with the same quartz we used in the bathrooms.   It had been tiled a few years ago, but after seeing the quartz in the bathrooms we could not resist completing the project by having the tile removed and the same quartz installed.   Every thing went so well,  jobs completed on time and all involved were very kind, polite and skilled.    It makes us wish there was more work we could have done."
4,"Project consisted of all new wood floors through out the house; new granite counter tops in the kitchen; new back splash; and new appliances;

The designer, Kristin, was very patient with her picky clients and in the end it was worth it. She worked with us on finding the right floor grade and stain color, granite slabs, and back splash design. The gentleman that installed the wood floors was second to none for being detail oriented, thorough, and you knew he took pride in his work. The other subs did quality work as well and knew their craft. The project manager did a good job of trying to keep everything moving towards completion.

I did not give 5 stars due to the lack of communication and it was obvious the PM had too many projects assigned. The end result was quality craftsmanship and product."
5,"Chris' response to our problem was quickly resolved.  In all of our dealings with SandW Kitchens we have been extremely pleased with their professionalism and rapid response to our questions and concerns. High quality work completed on time with excellent results.  We will use them again on our next project.
We recently had an issue with lighting but it was resolved with one phone call!  GREAT  RESPONSE AND SERVICE!"
5,"We hired s+w kitchens to do a complete tear down and build up of our 2 bedroom beach condo.  Adam Vinson of the Palm Harbor office and his crew did a superb job.  They worked carefully with us to consider all the options for flooring, paint, countertops, windows, etc and helped us make the proper selections that fit both our taste and our budget.  S+W overcame challenges with permits, condo building restrictions, and unexpected structural oddities.  The crews that worked on our place were very capable and professional.  With the completed job we have a redecorated condo unit that looks fantastic and meets our every need.  We are very happy and satisfied and cannot thank S+W and Adam Vinson enough for creating such a wonderful place to live.  I would highly recommend S+W to anyone looking to renovate their house or condo."
5,"We purchased Omega cabinetry from S&W kitchens for our bathrooms.  We love the high quality American made product from Omega cabinetry.  The S&W designers are very knowledgeable about the product, and were able to help us customize the layout, color, and design for our particular needs. With their large selection of products that they carry S&W staff was able to help us decide on the product that was right for us and our budget. The cabinets were delivered to our house in the time frame that was estimated.  My husband did all the installation of the cabinetry, and S&W was very helpful with questions he had during installation.  We will soon be doing our kitchen and will most definitely be purchasing through S&W Kitchens!"
1,"We were very excited to remodel our Master Bathroom.  It started out as just adding a jetted tub to the space and grew into our ""Dream Bathroom"" by completely redoing the walk-in shower, Vanity top, sinks, toilet and water closet, along with reconfiguring walls.  We didn't know that our ""Dream"" would turn into a ""Nightmare"".  Early-on in our planning, we found a supplier/installer for the quartz that we wanted to line the walls, tub deck and Vanity top; and needed a local Bathroom contractor for the remainder of the project.  After contacting a few local Kitchen and Bath professionals, we decided to contract with S&W Kitchens, even though their estimate was $4000 higher than any of the others.  We made this decision due to our comfort with the Designer and Estimator/Project Coordinator that we dealt with during the detailed planning process, S&W Kitchens' reputation, advertizing and the promise of a structured process with ""the Highest Possible Level of Customer Service & Communication"".

We were assigned a Construction Superintendent, who initially met with us and our Designer to go over the job, ALL details of the contract and develop a schedule.  Our job was estimated to be 5 to 7 weeks from start to completion, which based on our prior knowledge of construction practices, we thought was a little excessive, but we accepted it.

Initially the job started out as promised, with daily morning planning calls from the Superintendent, which we had requested.  There were minor day-to-day issues which popped up and were dealt with.  We understand that this is normal for construction.  However, we began to notice a pattern, starting with the quality of sub-contractors on the job.  Next the communication started to drop off.  It became a REAL PROBLEM after we made the substantial post demo payment.  The Construction Superintendent had all sorts of excuses as to why he didn't call us with a daily update, as we had requested.  Often, he didn't even return our voicemail requests for a call-back. He didn't seem to understand many of The Contract details or be able to manage the project properly.  The Superintendent consistently tried to put the blame on our Designer or others in the Company for his inability to control the job.  As our main contact on the job, we were told that it was his responsibility to understand our project and Contract completely in order to execute the job.  The ""final straw"" came when the sub-contractor to install the shower floor showed up and was NOT the original person that came out to pre-plan the installation.  They had NO knowledge of the product that we had specified. Our Designer and Estimator/Project Coordinator had researched the product thoroughly and knew that it was ""different"" from regular epoxy. The sub-contractor refused to follow the very specific instructions that came with the product, stating that ""they knew epoxy floors"".  We tried to contact the Construction Superintendent (who was not on the job site when ANY of the sub-contractors were performing), because the shower floor sub-contractor started to apply the product improperly, but we only got the Superintendent's voicemail.  So, we panicked and called our Designer to report we had a major issue on-site! Later we were chastised by the Superintendent, because he said we should only go thru him (S&W Kitchens' literature states ""our project managers, construction team members and designers are always available for any questions you may have"").  When the Superintendent finally did show up on the job, he didn't stop the shower floor sub-contractor, and he gave us his ""personal guarantee"" and that of S&W that they ""knew what they were doing and we would LOVE the finished product"". That wasn't the case.  It turned out totally unacceptable with sharp edges, uneven coverage and no slope in some areas.  At that point, we knew that there was no way that the Superintendent was credible any longer and our relationship with him had deteriorated to the point that we could no longer rely on him to complete the project. He had taken some shortcuts throughout the project, was NEVER on-site for the mandatory County Inspections (we had to walk the inspector through every detail) and had NOT adhered to the Contract requirements. We contacted our Legal Representative and sought her advice regarding our possible courses of action. We had to request a new Construction Superintendent and threatened legal action.  As a direct result, The Director of Field Operations took over our job.  A Certified Installer for the shower floor product was retained to chip-out and re-do it.  This time it turned out perfectly.  We went over ALL the missed details, issues, and Contract concerns with the Field Operations Director.  He was very professional, addressed these items, and we were finally able to get the job completed.

It's a shame that we didn't have someone like the Field Operations Director to work with our wonderful Designer and Project Coordinator, (who were both very knowledgeable and professional) from the beginning.  We might have been spared the painful experiences and anguish. The Total Project Time was 12 1/2 weeks and only then due to getting our legal representative's support and advice, not the original 5 to 7 weeks estimated.  We can only hope that if there are any Warranty Issues in the future that S&W Kitchens will stand by their Warranty.  Unlike their advertising, we were NOT ""100% happy"" with the overall process and ""The S&W Difference"" was NOT ""Simply Wonderful!"""
1,"S&W Kitchens of Melbourne, FL were extremely difficult to work with.  We hired them to reface the kitchen cabinets and install a granite counter top and back-splash. The project manager would not communicate with us and never met any of the deadlines.  We would have to track him down just to get an update.  It was a fairly small and simple project, yet it took over a month to complete not to mention the two months it took from the initial consultation to the project began.  

The project manager wound of quitting the company in the middle of the installation phase and no one from the company would return our calls. It took a couple of  visits to the showroom to talk to the manager to get the project back on track.  During the installation phase the wrong parts were ordered two different times which delayed the project even more.  Not once did anyone come to perform a Quality Assurance check of the work that had been done.  

Since the installation we have had cabinet doors fall off twice.  We come to realize that they did not secure the dishwasher to the cabinet or counter-top.  So the dishwasher tilts forward anytime the door is opened.  We have contacted the manager once again and it has been two weeks and they have yet to send anyone to correct the deficiencies or contact us as to when to expect repairs to be made.  

I would personally not recommend this company because they only seem to care about getting paid and not providing a quality product. I say this because they would not return our calls and seemed to blow us off during our visits to the showroom.  However they were quick to call if they had not received their money!"
3,This company remodeled our bathroom this past winter.  They have a new location in Tampa and we worked with the new store.
4,"Kristin did a great job on designing the kitchen. She was very helpful in suggesting ideas when I was trying to figure out how to work my cookbooks into the kitchen. in my old kitchen I stored my cookbooks across the top of my cabinets and it was very inconvenient.  She suggested the open cupboards over my washer and dryer. This worked wonderfully.  She never looked at my thoughts as ""no you can't do that"", but rather ""what if we did this"".  She helped get me the maximum amount of storage that I needed while staying within our budget. She was able to work my washer and dryer into the design of the kitchen as well."
5,"We hired S&W Kitchens to do a complete renovation of our laundry room.  From design, to demolition, to procurement, installation and completion, they did a fantastic job all around.  Chris Druschel (design coordinator) and Tim Hobson (construction superintendent) are creative, dedicated and skilled professionals who were a pleasure to work with from start to finish.  The project was completed on time and within budget as promised.  Tim and Chris kept us informed at every step of the process.  While we had high expectations going into the project, S&W far exceeded our expectations.  We could not give S&W as a whole and Chris Druschel and Tim Hobson in particular a higher recommendation.  We would not hesitate to recommend them to our friends and neighbors or to hire them for other projects in the future."
5,"Recently had a complete remodel of my '80s kitchen.  They did a great job designing the new space and all of the workmen were very professional.  The old space was gutted.  One window was removed  and the ceiling was raised to increase storage.  I now have more storage space than I have ""stuff'.  A very nice predicament.  I replaced ""everything"" in the kitchen except for 2 of the 3 existing windows.  I am very pleased with how everything turned out and the time line and cost was right on target."
5,"Bill is an exceptional designer.  He listens to your needs and offers very good suggestions.  He is detailed-oriented, which is really a plus when you know how you want to use a space but not how to make it happen.  Bill makes it happen!  This is the first part of a two-part home office project."
5,"We could not be happier with our experience with Finecraft renovating our kitchen and bath, as well as overseeing the installation for a new HVAC system.  Every craftsman was skillful, kind, and thoughtful of us as we maneuvered around them over the months of this project.  The attention to detail was impressive, and the hands-on approach of George (the owner) and Vivian (the project manager - and George's first cousin) always made us feel totally confident that we were getting our money's worth.  We recommend them without reservation.  Maryetta Andrews-Sachs and Bob Zeskind - 4920 45th St. NW"
5,"I had the pleasure of working with FineCraft Contractors on a full renovation and addition that I designed for a client in Northern Virginia.  George Papaheraklis and Vivian made a great team, paying close attention to details and quality workmanship. It is refreshing to work with a builder who has a collaborative approach and is 'hands on.' The client lived in the house during a large project and FineCraft worked hard to make that happen and ensure they were happy with the end result. I would highly recommend FineCraft as a top-notch builder to any of my clients and hope to work with them again!"
5,We really enjoyed working with FineCraft for our basement refresh. They were extremely responsive and took great care in making sure our project was done right and on time. They do a really nice job setting projects up with a team so you always know who your point person is for questions or concerns during the work. They also did a really nice job keeping us updated. We really appreciated that as issues came up (which they are always bound to do when renovating a 70 year old house) that our contractor was always ready with options as well as his best suggestion for how we could solve problems and make it work. We will definitely be returning to FineCraft for future projects and are really loving our new basement space!
5,"I’ve had the pleasure and privilege  to work of Fine craft Contractors  for a very long time. The first time  Owner and principal George Papaheraklis and I initially contracted with me was in 1987 almost 35 years ago! One can immediately ascertain that George has Architectural Training and an artistic eye merely by the way he could anticipate the next design move and and the way he can finesse meticulous details with visually graceful solutions. Our Attention to detail and the minutia are often a challenge for many general contractors but George leans into these challenges with a positive attitude and productive energy. One particular ecfample was the sculpture above the front door of our Midcentury addition and renovation.  Initially a flea market fragment, DLA's last minute detailing required stone and steel. This could have been vocalized with frustration but instead was met by George Papaheraklis with passion and has become the crowning jewel of the composition. A client once heard George saying under his breath that his quest for good construction is ""life sustaining"" for him. Since we first met decades ago, his close knit staff has  grown; in both size and professionality. One of our mutual projects was of particular challenge. However it was constructed methodically and intelligently along with  Vivian who is integral to FineCraft's efficiency, stream lined production and ""can do"" nature.  This was was no small task especially as two prjects they have worked with us on took place in the middle the pandemic. Dasha, Niko and Patrick who I have worked with personally  are all a part of the caliber FineCraft Contractors brings to the table and table saw!"
5,"We couldn't be more pleased with FineCraft! They flawlessly executed a complicated design to create a modern 'floating' porch on our 1930s center hall colonial house. All of their trades - including the mason, carpenter, electrician, painter, etc - worked together seamlessly and in lockstep to bring the project to life. We loved how George and Vivian were always coming by the house on a daily basis to answer any questions and make sure the quality was up to par. We always felt like we were up to speed on what was happening and where we were in the process. We would definitely choose FineCraft again for future projects and we are ecstatic about the work they did or us."
5,I have to say we are completely satisfied with the bathroom remodel. It met and exceeded expectations and was long overdue. I never had to question the teams expertise or competence which can't be said for every contractor in the DC area. We look forward to either working with your team again.
4,Great company--goes the extra mile.  Very dedicated professionals who do what is needed to make it right. Great to work with.
5,"FineCraft just completed a major, year-long remodel for us in Northern Virginia.  We are delighted with the quality materials, workmanship, and attention to detail.  We lived in the house during the work. You might question this choice, but with FineCraft, it worked.  We saw the same crews–not random contractors–every day.  To a man, they were friendly, courteous, and took pains to leave a clean living space at the end of every day.  George Papaheraklis was on site every few days, troubleshooting, improving, and explaining what was going to happen and in what order.  The house looks great and is easy to live in.  We got more than expected and at a fair price."
5,Consummate professionals! Easy to work with and would recommend these guys to anyone who wants a high quality and professional job!
5,They did my addition and were excellent. Shout out to Chris who was always so kind and professional and always available when needed!
5,"Finecraft prides itself on attention to detail, and indeed this was our experience throughout the renovation project (a kitchen and sunroom upgrade that opened interior space without modifying the exterior footprint of the house). To make our lives much easier, they built a separation wall between the work area and the rest of the living area and reconstructed a temporary kitchen on the main floor in the living area, so we were able to stay in the house during the construction. This made a big difference during the forced home-based work due to Covid pandemic. The staff left the place in good shape each day before leaving. At the end, they did not hesitate to come back several times and in a timely manner to complete the details remaining on the punch list. We love our new space."
4,"FineCraft has done two significant projects for us - a major terrace remake four years ago and now a total kitchen renovation.  We are very pleased with their workmanship and the ease of our working relationship.  On several occasions, they have taken extra steps to please us."
5,"We were converting a two story great room into a second floor with new bedrooms, as well as renovating our kitchen and a bathroom / laundry room.   With a baby on the way our timeline was tight - no room for delays - and Finecraft not only delivered but exceeded all expectations in terms of reliability, craftsmanship, and staying true to the estimate.   We were out of town for most of the project and were able to communicate effectively with the team via mobile app and/or Facetime.   Once we were back in the house, Rosendo and his team were very respectful and friendly (and kept everything clean!), and responsive to any and all questions or minor issues.   Would hire them again for any project.   Very pleased with the final result as well as the process.  Thank you!"
5,"Finecraft did an excellent job, our addition is beautiful and they were nice to work with.  We had a few hiccups along the way, but they were quick to fix."
5,We have had the pleasure of working with FineCraft on a handful of projects. They are attentive and responsive to both clients and fellow professionals. We look forward to future opportunities to collaborate with the crew at FineCraft.
5,"It has been a pleasure to work with the Finecraft team. They have great communication, responsive and their attention to detail is top notch! I am looking forward to future projects with Finecraft!!"
5,"Finecraft did a fantastic job on our renovation -- we highly recommend them. Thanks to all the staff, but especially to Rei for shepherding the project through on the site. We were consistently impressed by the level of craftsmanship and attention to detail that went into the project. We can't thank the team enough."
5,"We had a great experience with a Finecraft from start to finish. Their professionalism, attention to detail and flexibility were remarkable. Our project turned out even better than expected, at a very competitive price. We are delighted!"
5,"Once again it was a pleasure working with George Papaheraklis and the Finecraft team. This project was very sophisticated, involving creative building challenges which Finecraft easily met. George always adds both value and Grace.

5,It was a great team that worked diligently and cohesively to deliver a new beautifully detailed and elegant two-family home on Capitol Hill!
5,Fantastic experience! We just love the team at FineCraft Contractors. We have used them for two renovations at our house and will use them again. Their customer service and professionalism are outstanding. We absolutely love the finished project and would recommend them to any looking to do work on their home.
5,"We hired FineCraft to renovate the basement in our 1958 split-level home.  It was important to us for the project to create a more functional living space that was still traditional enough to match the rest of our home's interior.  They did a terrific job - followed the architect's plan to the letter.  The quality of the work was top-notch.  In fact, the WSSC inspector thought the work under his purview was the nicest he'd seen.  The members of the construction crew were polite and professional.  George has a fine aesthetic that clearly carries through to all of the work done by FineCraft. The workmen who laid the tile, particularly in the bathroom, are truly artisans.   It is a lovely space, and we could not be happier.  I'd recommend FineCraft to others who are considering a remodeling job."
5,"We have done the remodeling of a bedroom (with loft + stairs) and a bathroom.
We were very pleased with Finecraft and I would highly recommend them.
This is a team of high professional with a very friendly staff. Everybody in the team has some specific expertise and are managed by a project lead. Though, the company is not too big and you can feel that this is a family business company and that they care about project."
5,Working with Finecraft was a very rewarding experience for me. The company worked well with my architects and executed all aspects of the project in a professional manner. I look forward to working with them again!
5,Our screen porch has a wow factor.  Finecraft took the architect's plans and turned them into a gorgeous and functional room.  The craftsmanship and attention to detail is apparent in every aspect of the construction.  They stayed within the specified time and budget constraints.  It was a pleasure to work with all members of the Finecraft team.
5,"We went through a long process of selecting a contractor for a remodel of our home on Capitol Hill. We are so glad we chose the fine people at Finecraft. The moment we interacted with them, we knew that there was chemistry. It was a long project with many customized flourishes that were unique and challenging. The Finecraft team did an incredible job and delivered our dream house. Their professionalism, attention to detail and overall team work made for a stress free journey through the construction. If we had to do this again, we will do it in a heartbeat. 

Thank you to the entire Finecraft team - Specially Jose and Dasha."
4,Enjoyed working with this team. Very professional and worked hard to minimize disruption to our family during construction period. Quality of work was stellar and communication was excellent.
5,"This team of professionals has an amazing ability to see what it is you want to create.  I have worked with this team in the community many times and when it came to getting a bid on my personal project, I knew they would not disappoint us.  Finecraft came, was on time listened to our ideas and then really looked at what we had to work with and created a plan that would work in our family budget.  They also gave us plenty of referral projects to go look at and customers to talk to for references.  It's not like, here are 3 people, its years of happy customers.  Their attention to detail and craftsmanship on their projects was what sold us.  Quality and excellent follow up."
5,"Finecraft Contractors, Inc is an absolutely first-class organization. Their name suits the quality of their management, personnel, and workmanship very well. They are true professionals in every sense. During the course of our home elevator construction and installation project, my wife and I got to know the Finecraft management and craftsmen team very well. We have only the most complimentary things to say about their courtesy, creativity, flexibility, and project management and execution skills. We highly recommend Finecraft Contractors, Inc to anyone who is looking for a superior home remodeling contractor."
5,"Finecraft did a wonderful job on this project.  In particular, their craftsmanship, timeliness, and attention to detail were admirable.  We look forward to working with them on Phase II of the project."
5,"We have now worked with Finecraft on a number of remodeling projects in the DC area.  They are a highly professional and skilled Contractor that produces quality craftsmanship and on time project delivery.  As Architects, we have found Finecraft brings value added ideas to the project whether it be product recommendations or if an issue is discovered how to solve it. We would highly recommend Finecraft to our clients."
5,We hired Finecraft to build our screened-in porch on a recommendation from our architect and overall were very pleased with the project.  The quality of work was very good and their team was professional and courteous.  We would absolutely recommend them for similar projects.
5,"Finecraft Contractors is a top quality operation. I have done multiple renovation projects with George and his team, including bathrooms, kitchen, addition, terrace, and in-law apartment. Finecraft has a great sense of aesthetics, great attention to detail, and the construction site is left impeccably clean every night. That's why I am a return customer!"
5,"Finecraft contractors is a well rounded professional company in the DC area. 
Their crew is highly skilled and the staff has superb customer service. Every project we have seen has exceeded our expectations. It is hard to find a building company with such high attention to detail. Working with the Finecraft family makes your experience enjoyable and gratifying."
5,"I have worked on several projects with Finecraft. They are an excellent company to work with and have a pleasant and knowledgeable staff that will always make client communication, service and quality their to priority!"
5,Finecraft did an excellent job renovating our garage and converting it into a gym. They were prompt in their reply and finished the project in the time they quoted which is huge! The price was reasonable and the staff was very responsive throughout the whole process. I highly recommend them for any home renovating project and will be using them again in the future!
5,"I hired Finecraft to handle a gut renovation of an 1890s townhouse in downtown Washington, DC. The property was an absolute mess and had been abandoned for 20 years. Finecraft were able to retain the front facade while constructing a new modern home with what was left of the old bones of the home. It turned out beautifully and is true to the architect's design. It was delivered on time and mostly on budget. I would recommend them to any other property owner in similarly situated historical/renovation jobs."
5,"As an architect, I'm naturally very protective of my clients with regard to contractor selection.  With Finecraft, i know that my clients are in good hands with a professional, honest, and thorough contractor.  Their work speaks for itself in terms of quality craftsmanship, and they are a delight to working with.  Communication is one of the most important parts of client management, and Finecraft clearly excels in this department. I would strongly recommend Finecraft to all of my clients no matter what type of project we design."
5,"We could not have imagined a better renovation experience! Everyone at Finecraft was a pleasure to work with from the owner all the way to the project manager, employees, and subcontractors. All were extremely nice, friendly, attentive, and with tremendous attention to detail. You could always contact them with a question and they would get back to you very quickly to explain or help. 

They did a great job on the addition of a mudroom, expansion and creation of a new open floor plan kitchen/family room combo, moving of a bathroom, renovation of two other bathrooms, and replacing the entire outside, including roof, windows, siding, patio, walkway, and portico. 

They completely transformed our house into a brand new property and we could not thank them enough. They were exactly on budget and on time, with no delays even though we substantially expanded the scope of the project. They were able to change gears smoothly and efficiently as our ideas evolved through the course of the work. They worked around our busy lives with 3 small children and were able to create a fully functioning mini-kitchen to allow us to stay in the house during the work.  Highly recommend them for your renovation/addition needs."
5,Finecraft did an extension on my historic house and it really is beautiful! George kept me in the loop about how it was all going. The team were efficient and respectful of my property and the problem-solving on the best way to get it all done was excellent. I would highly recommend this company.
5,"As both architect and client, I was pleased with Finecraft Contractors. I found the crews to be hardworking and pleasant. With our project, George took a hands on approach from beginning to end, and collaborated well to help create what we envisioned for our home."
4,"Generally quite pleased with our experience with Finecraft.  We hired them to complete a three story, 900 sq ft addition (plus some renovations to the existing space) in our NW DC home originally built in 1932.  They worked well with our architect, and showed consideration and willingness to work with us throughout the process, and were responsive to the minor concerns of our neighbors.  We were able to stay in our home throughout the project, which was completed (though punchlist) in less than 6 months.

In particular we found the quality of their carpentry (everything from floors, decking, exterior, closet work, trim) and paint to be outstanding.  We were very impressed, and received lots of compliments from friends and family.

Two areas I'd suggest clients keep in mind; first, as with almost all contractors, their approach to project management isn't to the same standard as with full service design-build firms.  You'll want to be proactive on communication about timelines, and confirm everything in writing (either emails or text.)  They are great at honoring commitments, but sometimes memories aren't perfect, and it's helpful to have a record.

The second area, related to above, was with the electrical work.  We did change things up a bit, but even with that, I wasn't super happy with the electrician.  Some of the work could have been done to a higher quality, and we had to tussle a bit him to get what we wanted; in a couple of cases the project wasn't done exactly as we wanted.  That could have been prevented if we did a better job documenting and holding them to what we discussed.

That all said I'd definitely recommend them.  Friendly and flexible, quality workmanship, and great price."
5,"We hired Finecraft to repair our master bathroom after the discovery of a leak and mold.  The Finecraft team was very professional and a pleasure to work with.  They listened to our concerns as well as our ideas and came up with recommendations that fit with the design.  They have a great network of suppliers and we were able to find great deals on tiles, fixtures and granite."
5,"After a year of discussions with our architect and Finecraft over the renovation of our 1920s colonial, we decided to go from a one story addition to a three story addition. George patiently addressed numerable questions raised by my detail -oriented husband. We lived in the house during the eight months of renovation, which enabled us to closely examine the outstanding craftsmen at work. George regularly came up with creative solutions to maximize the functionality of the space within our budget. When my husband and I disagreed about anything, we could always rely on George's professional vision and diplomatic resolution.   My serotonin levels would rise each day when I saw George and Vivien arrive in the red pickup; they inspire confidence.The Finecraft team is committed to excellent craftsmanship in a timely manner. We enjoyed working with them immensely and would love to do another project with them soon."
5,"Finecraft Contractors is by far, the most professional, caring, competent company we have used to work on our home. They completely restyled our 1940's Cape Cod 1st floor, as well as completed other outside improvements with magnificent results. From start to finish we always knew what was going on with our project. All of the folks on the project were absolutely the best - and they all stayed on the job until it was finished. As with older homes there are usually surprises when making changes to the floor plan. Our team anticipated those possibilities and problem-solved with us to accommodate our wishes. We felt that Finecraft truly cared about us, our needs, and our home and we could not be more pleased. We truly feel part of the Finecraft family!"
5,"Tess Moran and Cabinet Discounters have worked with Finecraft Contractors on many projects.  Finecraft can always be counted on for beautiful craftsmanship, excellent project management and top notch customer service."
5,"Fisher Lumber has been working together with Finecraft Contractors for four decades, They perform first class, detailed workmanship. If quality is what you want in your home improvements...look no further"
5,"I am an architectural designer based in LA, and my parents live in Rockville, MD.  Though they were in need of some basic home maintenance repairs as well as a kitchen renovation, they were completely intimidated by the construction process and didn't know where to begin.  Finecraft was recommended to me by a reputable architecture firm in Maryland, and it was a very smooth process to get everything completed on time and on budget once they were provided with a scope of work and design, even from across the country.  My parents are now thoroughly enjoying their kitchen makeover and new, non leaking windows."
5,"We were the architects for a complete 2nd floor remodeling job in Rockville. The project included the complete reconfiguration of the master bathroom and bedroom as well as moving the laundry closet into a new laundry room. We recommended Finecraft to our clients when they asked us about a trusted contractor. Often times it is risky for an architect to recommend a certain contractor but with Finecraft we have no hesitation. I know they will be professional, honest and if selected do a good job that is in line with the design intent.
I highly recommend them for your home remodeling projects."
5,Professional company with a very personal touch.  High quality work- You truly get what you pay for!  I feel confident every time I refer them to friends or clients.  They earn & keep the love & trust from their clients because they are passionate about what they do.  Can't say enough wonderful things about this company & leadership!
5,"We hired Finecraft to perform a remodeling of our townhome third floor. It was a significant undertaking as every room was impacted by the remodeling, which involved the renovation of the master bathroom, second bathroom, creation of a laundry room, expansion of closet space in the 3 bedrooms, creation of 2 linen closets, and renovation of the half bathroom on the main floor. Finecraft was recommended by the architect who designed the plans of the remodeling, as he pointed out the quality of the work performed. We ended up hiring Finecraft because they were interested by the project and they wanted to work with us. In comparison with other general contractors we interviewed, their pricing was very competitive. Overall, the project lasted 2 months. Our family of 4 lived in the house while under renovation, the workers were very accommodating and respectful of the circumstances, and most importantly very clean in consideration of the work performed. What we are the most pleased with is the quality of the work and the details in the finishes. They fully enable the vision we had for this remodeling. Even though we wish that there was more clarity on the agreement, better communication with certain change orders, and more flexibility with the allowances, we are very pleased to have chosen Finecraft. The functionality of our new layout and the beautiful bathrooms are now permanent features of our new home, working with Finecraft worth every single penny. We also referred Finecraft to friends who have subsequently hired them for their project needs."
5,"Top notch service!

After meeting with over a dozen contractors, we found Finecraft to be the perfect fit for our renovation.  They performed the work within the timeline specified and ensured we didn't exceed our budget.  The crews showed up Mon-Fri at the same time and progress was made each and everyday.  Although we (the customer) made a number of mistakes, Finecraft was patient and understanding, ensuring we were satisfied every step of the way.

Overall, we would recommend anyone use Finecraft for their future renovation needs.  I never wouldn't of imagined I would ever be so happy with a contractor's performance, but here I am, writing this review.  If your a stickler for exceptionally high quality work without having to pay ridiculous prices, go with Finecraft, it will be worth the wait considering their high demand."
5,"We have been working with Finecraft Contractors for a while now and have had a great experience - we are stone fabricators and they send us their clients to choose their countertops. They are professional and helpful to ensure their clients needs are met - whenever we need specific information about about a job, they always make sure everything is correct and we are on the same page on every project. As a sales representative, I know how important it is to communicate with the client - especially if there is a contractor involved. 
We definitely recommend  Finecraft for your house renovation and look forward to working with them for future projects."
5,Finecraft is just terrific. Their staff is friendly; their work is meticulous and the did our project on-time and within budget.
5,I have had the pleasure to work with Finecraft on several projects. They are a family owned and operated business who takes pride in their work as well as delivering a remarkable experience to their clients.
5,"Finecraft is an unusual combination of exceptional talent, fine craftsmanship, delivering more than expected and with personal touches that would make any home remodeling or home construction project a dream for the owner.  On time, on the ball, on target and on top of the project from start to finish.  It's been a pleasure to attend the open houses to discover the range of services and beautiful outcomes."
5,"Mario worked on two separate projects at my home.  One was an outdoor window that needed to be rebuilt the other removing an old bar area and replacing it with a closet.  Mario was efficient, polite, fairly priced and provided outstanding workmanship.  I'm using him again this month for yet another project.  I highly recommend him!"
5,"I am an Interior Designer and I had the pleasure of working with Finecraft Contractors, Inc. because my client was doing a major renovation, and Finecraft was doing the remodel. 
My experience in working with them was professional, cordial and efficient.  It seemed that our mutual goal was to make sure that our client  got what they wanted to their utmost satisfaction!
I treat every client like I would want to be treated...................and that's what I saw in Finecraft Contractors, Inc. as well!  Keep up the professionalism and quality of your work!!!"
5,"I have found Finecraft to be a very professional company, who focuses on customer satisfaction and delivering a superb product above all. From first contact to finishing the project, Finecraft is friendly, professional, and genuinely cares. The project turned out beautiful and better than I expected!!"
5,"We hired Finecraft for three projects that included remodeling our kids bathroom from a single user to multi user setup, refinishing our basement, and creating a built-in bookcase/fireplace/TV wall for the master bedroom.  All 3 projects turned out great.  The team working on the projects where there every day, and they staffed resources accordingly - so some days it was 2 guys, and other days there was up to 5 guys depending on what needed to be accomplished.  All projects where completed within the time estimate, and on the agreed upon prices.  Their construction staff all wore corporate tee-shirts, and where professional and careful of cleanliness and the surrounding spaces.  While I think it is hard to determine a low cost provider for these types of services, value is more important.  And Finecraft delivered that, as well as adding a designer to take our project visions into reality.  We have more work to do, and will hire them again."
5,"We hired Finecraft to renovate our late-1890s row house in DC, including putting in a new kitchen.  We were very pleased with the work done by Finecraft.  George and his team were able to create a kitchen that has all of today’s modern amenities but still has the charm and finishes consistent with the age of the house.  The craftsmanship of the cabinetry and molding is beautiful.  They created plaster molding in the kitchen that matches the original molding perfectly.  Beyond the kitchen, the Finecraft team carefully restored the walls, molding and floors back to their original glory and updated our powder room and foyer tile.  The work was done timely and within budget.  And, the Finecraft team was responsive to our questions and requests.  We would recommend them without reservation for any type of renovation – from new build to restoring an older home."
5,George and his crew are complete professionals with and eye for details. The additions to our house by Finecraft are high quality and very well constructed. I highly recommend them for any project.
5,"We were set to hire another contractor when we met George Papaheriklis of Finecraft Contractors, Inc. Not having any experience remodeling or hiring contractors and after hearing some of our friends’ experiences we were very weary and nervous about the whole process. George’s openness, demeanor and patience answering all of our questions and concerns put us at ease in no time. Needless to say, after just a few minutes we knew we have found our contractor. The experience overall was great and the end result fantastic. It was not without its ups and downs, but during the process George and the Finecarft’s crew were very patient, diligent and most of all professional. They addressed all of our requests and made sure we were completely satisfied with the end work; not an easy feat when dealing with a self-professed perfectionist. An inch to the left or to the right was not an issue; they worked very hard to make us happy. George was very hands-on throughout our project and was available anytime there was a question or concern. He was very candid and willing to explain things to us both regarding the scope of work and the costs involved, especially on those pesky change orders (our own requests). Because of his background in architecture, George offered suggestions and made changes that made things just right, going so far as to doing things just because they will look better, no change orders. We were living in the house while the renovation/addition was going on. Finecraft not only provided us with a temporary kitchen, complete with a sink and running water, while they did the work, but they were very accommodating to our needs and timing, made sure everything was clean at the end of the day and took every possible precaution to avoid dust and debris coming into our living space. Many friends have commented on the craftsmanship and quality of the work. Most of all, Finecraft stands behind their work, they have been prompt and thorough in addressing all those little and no so little things that sometimes pop up on new construction; nothing has been too big or too small for them to come and fix. In the end, what matters most is that George and the Finecraft’s crew has our gratitude, respect and above all, trust."
4,"We contacted Finecraft for a smaller project in the summer of 2016 based on the Houzz reviews. They contacted us back very quickly, but because we had a tight deadline, Finecraft were not able to do the project themselves, but recommended one of their sub-contractors called American Trademark. AT renovated a small master bath for us on a very short deadline and completed the project in just over 2 weeks. The process went smoothly and we got the bathroom we wanted. They cleaned up at the end of each day and kept the mess to a minimum. The team was professional and met the deadline and stayed within budget. After completion, we noticed that some paint in the stairway to our second floor had been ripped off probably when they removed the paper that had protected the stairs. Not a big job to have fixed, but the reason what I did not give the full 5 stars."
5,"We hired Finecraft Contractors, Inc. for a third floor addition to our row house in Washington DC.  We would highly recommend Finecraft as a contractor.  We were very happy with their work.  In addition, they were responsive, answered our questions and concerns promptly, and went above and beyond to make sure the project was completed to our satisfaction (including the completion a number of added change orders along the way and completing punchlist items)."
5,"We contacted Finecraft because one of my coworkers had used them for 2-3 projects and recommended their work.  Niko and Chris came to the house and looked over the kitchen.  They immediately made some useful suggestions about the design for our new kitchen.  Niko put us in contact with a first rate designer.  We visited Appliance Distributors Unlimited (ADU) after seeing the listing on the Finecraft website.  We worked with the designer and a representative from ADU through several iterations of design, cabinet selection and appliance selection until we had a design and set of appliances that we liked and that fit within our budget.  The good folks at Finecraft got to work on Tuesday July 5th and finished on Friday July 15th.  They had told us it would take about two weeks, meaning 10 business days, and it took 9   Most of the work on the kitchen was done by one worker, Moses, and his assistant.  The work was extremely well done.  Moses is a true craftsman.  He is meticulous and he knows what he is doing.  There were several points along the way at which we had to make decisions about routing wires, the vent for the hood and other things.  We were given the opportunity to participate in the decision making where it was appropriate to do so.  All in all, we are very satisfied with the final product.  I would be very happy to have Finecraft do other projects, such as our master bathroom, especially if Moses or someone else with similar skill is involved."
5,"After interviewing several other local contractors, I hired Finecraft to relocate our master bathroom to the window line to permit natural light in the bathroom.  We also created a master dressing room (closet).  I was so impressed with their work that I expanded on the assignment to include several other projects.  I truly enjoyed working with George.  He is delightful to work with.  George comes up with excellent/creative ideas to solve issues, while being sensitive to cost restrictions.  George was personally very involved in our project from start to finish and he went over and beyond many times.  The construction workers who were in our home were very respectful of our home and cleaned up every day.  They were very accommodating and did an excellent job.  FineCraft cared very much about our project and ensured that we were satisfied.  I am very pleased with the project and FineCraft and highly recommend them."
5,"We recently completed a magnificent kitchen and renovation project with Finecraft and we could not be happier. George and his team brought their fine workmanship and attention to detail that made all the difference in producing a finished product that exceeded our expectations. George was very hands-on throughout our project and made himself available anytime there was a question or concern.  Because of his extensive background in architecture, George worked well with our architect and other vendors we used to complete our project. The entire Finecraft team was extremely professional, responsive and truly a pleasure to work with.  I would not hesitate to recommend Finecraft to any homeowner interested in doing a renovation or building a brand new home."
5,"Finecraft did a fantastic job on remodeling my bedroom and bathroom. The work crew was tremendous -- talented, courteous, professional, on time. The design staff was very helpful in helping me with decisions on color, selection of materials and decor. They were very accommodating and a pleasure to collaborate with."
5,"We have worked with Finecraft Contractors, Inc. in several projects now and it we must say their work is 5-star. In addition to their quality and superb customer service, they are a joy to work with. It's rare to see first hand a construction company that stands behind their word and delivers with such abundance. The Finecraft team truly cares for they clients and goes the extra mile to make sure they are happy and satisfied with the project. Looking forward to more projects with them."
5,"My wife and I downsized to a condo. The location of our new condo  was exactly what we wanted but the interior of the condo was not. We decided to gut our 2,000 sq.ft. condo and  construct a very  modernly designed one. After much searching,  we and our designer chose Finecraft as the builders. We presented  precise plans, which had a number of unusual features.  Finecraft did excellent work: details of the construction were carefully attended to; they arranged for material to be brought from Portugal, Japan and elsewhere; they were flexible in accommodating some changes we made as the construction went along. The configuration of our glasswork was unusual in shape and size, but  the work of Finecraft in managing to actually bring the glass into the condo and install it  was truly impressive. 

The cost of the project was what we had agreed to. The project took a little longer than expected. But this was because of the severe limitations our condo association placed on the times when work could be done  and the convoluted  rules and unpredictable inspection scheduling  imposed by the Fairfax County building inspection bureaucracy.

Finally,  the President of Finecraft, George Papaheraklis,  kept a keen eye on the project's progress, as frequently present  and responded quickly to any questions we had.   We highly recommend Finecraft."
5,"Finecraft did great work for us, and when we had issues arrive, they were quick to rectify them. We are very appreciative of there attentiveness."
5,We recently had two bathrooms updated by Finecraft in our 1930s Glover Park house and could not be happier with the process and results! From the beginning Niko and his team excelled at communication - whether it was Niko checking in to make sure the work had begun on time or Chris (our project manager) letting us know what work would be done. We were impressed with how hard their team worked to make sure the project was complete before our planned move-in date. Every time we went to the house to check on the progress the team was working incredibly hard and were happy to show us what had been completed that day. We are already planning to use Finecraft again for future projects!
5,"In February 2016, Finecraft renovated our family room.  The owner sketched a preliminary drawing based on our desire for light and warmth, and provided a ballpark cost estimate.  We discussed the options and details, and finalized the plan and cost estimate with the caveat that we could be flexible with the artistic plan and the cost if and as needed. The big decisions were made prior to beginning the work.  We were guided to a door company to select a door and a stone company to pick out surround and hearth stone. To make a more expansive family room with plenty of light, they knocked down a wall; installed a window that matched the other two windows already in the room; built bookcases with storage cabinets; a window seat with drawers, and a closet; installed a wood floor and ceiling lights; updated the fireplace from a brick to stone façade with an inset for a flat panel television; and replaced a sliding glass door with a double French door.  The crew arrived on time each day, completed the work assignments, and cleaned up at day’s end. The crew was friendly, professional, and not intrusive. In fact, they were so trustworthy that we provided access to a key for flexibility such that we were not dependent on their work schedule.  We were contacted at the end of each day with a summary of what was done, what would be done next, and what we, as the homeowners, needed to decide or go pick out in the week ahead, e.g., paint color, cabinet door knobs.  The crew even moved large furniture in and out of the work space so we did not have to do so. Overall, our experience with Finecraft was extremely positive. The work was done within schedule and budget. We have worked with Finecraft on previous renovations, large and small, and will do so again.
The crew at Finecraft are true professionals, well trained, and skilled such that they act independently and do not require direct supervision."
5,I had the opportunity to work with George and his crew on a number of different home renovations ranging from small remodels to full bottom to top demolition through renovation.  In all instances I found the crews to be pleasant and hardworking and fully in alignment with George's vision for the final product.  George takes a very hands on approach to all his projects from the beginning to the end and works very well with his clients to create exactly what they envision for their new home.
5,I have worked with Finecraft in three different projects and I find them very professional and detail oriented. I am a designer with many years of experience and worked with a lot of different contractors. Gisela Interiors
5,"I contacted Finecraft from California after seeing a picture of a bathroom that I loved on Houzz, they answered the phone when I called and emailed me all the information I needed within 24 hours.  They really were wonderful.  Much appreciated for helping out!!  5 Stars for awesome customer service!!"
5,"After interviewing and getting bids and references from 10 different recommended contractors, we hired Finecraft Contractors to excavate and gut renovate our basement and they did an exceptional job.  They worked with us to make my vision come alive, and their attention to detail and workmanship exceeded my very high expectations.  The Finecraft team was reliable, respectful, and responsive, and they finished ahead of schedule and on budget.  I would 100% recommend them."
5,"We had Finecraft remodel our kitchen and family room from July 13 - October 13, 2015. Every aspect of the renovation was a positive experience. They said it would take three months, and they were done basically three months to the date they started. The quality of work was superb and it was easy to get in touch with either the owner or foreman throughout the entire project. We will definitely use Finecraft again!"
5,"Finecraft Contractors are the best.  Their workmanship is top-notch and their workers are all experts in the respective fields.  They are a fantastic crew.  We are pleased with our additions and changes which will enable us to stay in our house as we become less mobile. We now have a beautiful custom-made roll-in shower and other bathroom changes that enable a person in a wheelchair to use the bathroom. This was a tricky undertaking because of the configuration we wanted. Most importantly, the owner, George Papaheriklis, listened to us and made sure that the construction was perfect,  He consulted with us all during the construction."
5,"Fine craft Contractors lives up to their name, Fine Craft!   Their leadership and crew were 100% and superseded all expectations.   I highly recommend hiring Fine Craft if you want true quality work, professionals who are passionate, honest and efficient.  A true headache free experience.   

Thank you Fine Craft for everything you have done for me and my family!

5,"I am an Architect and worked with Fine Craft for a complete home redesign/renovation project. I happy to say that the project was a success. Fine Craft Contractors are very professional, detail oriented and incredibly responsive. They exceeded my expectations and would recommend their services to my clients for their future construction projects. They follow the design through, completed the project on time and exactly as it was planned."
5,"I am an architect and worked with FineCraft on a kitchen/ family room renovation.  Their
work is excellent and high quality with attention to detail.  The project was finished within the timeline projected.  I enjoyed working with George Papaheraklis, as he is a master builder with many years of experience, has a good eye, and brings great ideas to the project.  My clients also enjoyed working with George and were very excited about the end product.  I highly recommend this company and look forward to working with them again!"
5,"We recently completed a large remodeling project in partnership with Finecraft Contractors, Inc.  The project encompassed a large, high end Kitchen and two baths, including the Master Bath.  George Papaheraklis and his fine crew are a pleasure to work with and have a keen attention to detail.  No request was too small and every team member was respectful and professional.  The end product turned out exactly as we had designed it, plus George made some wonderful suggestions along the way which were executed in the overall project.  I would not hesitate to recommend Finecraft to my design colleagues or homeowners looking for a quality project!  George is highly professional, easy to work with and his team is dedicated to their craft and always strive to achieve the highest level of client satisfaction."
5,"I have used Finecraft Contractors, Inc. on several occasions and I highly recommend using them on your next project.  Finecraft does very high end work with prices that are reasonable compared to the industry.  The management team, their organization of projects, keeping customers informed, happy and satisfied before during and after the project is complete is the best.  I will definitely continue to use them and will refer them to anyone in need of a good contractor."
5,Great Contractor to work with.  Very professional and worked well coordinating scheduling for a smooth installation.   High quality work and attention to detail.
5,"Finecraft recently renovated our kitchen.  Not only did they provide us with a temporary kitchen, complete with a sink and running water, while they did the work, but they were timely, professional and skilled in all they did.  Their attention to detail elevated the project.  Our kitchen has been transformed.  We are extremely impressed by their efforts."
5,"I hired Finecraft to build out a previously unfinished basement, reconstruct a front porch and a side porch and replace all of the shutters on our house's façade.  Finecraft did a tremendous job.  The workers were professional, worked quickly but with high quality and there was always great communication so I knew what activities were going to occur and when.  We actually had an unforeseen waterproofing issue with our foundation which Finecraft addressed quickly, provided an effective solution and executed the fix at a very reasonable cost.  It was a pleasure to work with Finecraft and I cannot recommend them more highly."
5,"Finecraft Contractors, Inc.

We completed a kitchen/family room renovation for our 40 year old home.  We met with  three contractors and received three quotes.  From design support to workmanship and quality, we were pleased with every aspect of our experience with Finecraft.   After  seeing a Finecraft renovation in the neighborhood, we were sold.  

The entire team was professional, clean and respectful of our home.  It is never easy to live through a kitchen renovation but George and Niko went out of their way to make the process easy for our family.  Without question we would recommend FineCraft to friends and family."
5,"Finecraft was recommended by our architect for a major renovation to our house (expanded and remodeled kitchen, family room and master bedroom ans master bathroom, as well as some other updates).

The workmanship and attention to detail was outstanding.  Finecraft was very responsive throughout the project, they provided good ideas and suggestions, they cleaned up very thoroughly throughout theproject.  The project manager was excellent and they clearly take great pride in their work.

We had done another major renovation several years earlier in a former house and we wish that Finecraft had done that one as well, because there was no comparison in the quality and management of our earlier project with the one that Finecraft managed.

I highly recommend Finecraft for any home renovation or construction project."
5,"We are first time home buyers and have never dealt with home renovations. Our house was in decent condition at purchase but needed a serious facelift throughout - we hired Finecraft to renovate the majority of the house, which meant new bathrooms, kitchen, new drywall pretty much everywhere, electrical, etc etc. They did an excellent job guiding us through the process (their site manager was particularly good, always calm, easy to talk to). They handled hiccups in the schedule and work plan very well, and had really good suggestions for improvements throughout the house (removing parts of walls, design ideas for custom cabinetry). Overall, excellent experience, and we are thrilled with the results. Highly recommend."
5,"Late 2014 through spring 2015, FineCraft undertook a major reconstruction of our backyard terrace, plus improvements to the inside of our house.  Outside work included: new retaining walls with extensive foundation improvements, extensive drainage improvements, blue stone paving, tree pits, trellis and wood slat fencing, new lighting, redirected and reinforced stairways, and removal of sunroom parapets.  Inside work included: two skylights, two new windows that required breaking through the existing structures, installing lighting fixtures and ceiling fan, and completion of requested small tasks.
 
Being a project limited to a small area, detail design and execution were critical.  We employed The Kurylas Studio as project architects.  Kurylas Studios recommended FineCraft as one of several contractors.  FineCraft’s expertise with architecture and attention to detail proved critical to the project success.  As a real team effort, FineCraft working with the architect and us, made several valuable design alterations.   They rebuilt one retaining wall rather than repair it and for a second retaining wall, they used traditional brick facing rather than ¼ inch brick facing.  Both company owners and the project foreman were professional, respectful, knowledgeable and easy to work with.  When we disagreed, their professionalism always led to quick resolutions, which all parties felt good about.  Impressive to us was how fair FineCraft priced change orders.  Not only are we satisfied, the whole team is proud how the project turned out."
5,"We hired Finecraft a few years back when we were planning a major renovation to our home. We had completed a similar renovation in the past on a previous home and the difference between our first experience and this one was like night and day. From the very beginning, George, his foreman and the crew were professional, responsive, worked quickly and efficiently and got the project done in the time estimated. We lived in our home during the renovation and the Finecraft crew showed up on time EVERY time, did the work each day and cleaned up!! after each days work. We had the same foreman for the complete project and he reflected George's and Finecraft's values of professionalism, attention to detail and pride in craftsmanship. During the process, George would review the upcoming work and make sure that all the details were taken care of. Their workmanship was superb, the fine details that speak to master carpentry and pride in workmanship are evident throughout the project. We have lived in our home for 10 years since that work was done and it still looks as good today as it did when it was newly finished. We recently needed some repair and remodeling done to another part of our home and we didn't even need to go out to bid - we just hired Finecraft again. You will not be sorry you chose them!"
5,"Finecraft Contractors, Inc. is an excellent company! The staff are very professional and efficient. I was so impressed by their work. The quality and design of their projects are some of the best I've seen in this industry. I would gladly work with them again!"
5,"This was my first experience working with George of Finecraft, He is a professional who listens, asks intelligent questions, and proposes great solutions based on his years of experience in the industry. The quality of Finecraft's work is high, and the staff is friendly and responsive. I strongly recommend George and the Finecraft team."
5,"Finecraft built an addition and new outbuilding, designed by my firm, for one of the more finely-detailed late-19th century homes in the town of Kensington's historic district. The owners chose Finecraft because they wanted to match the quality of detail and workmanship that had sold them on the house in the first place. The end result did not disappoint. Finecraft performed at a high level of professionalism and the quality of their workmanship was superb."
5,"Finecraft has been in the area for 30+ years now and has demonstrated time and time again that their company stands for quality. I can say this because I've seen their work firsthand and I've followed them for many years now. I simply love their work and their quality. They stand by what they build no matter what. It goes without saying they really care for the houses they build and for the homeowners they collaborate with. 

As a homeowner, it's important for me to know that I can rely on the contractor I hire. I can say without a doubt that I can rely on Finecraft to follow through and produce a quality product without concern or hassle. Once you find this type of relationship you never want to let it go. 

Having a good contractor is one thing. Having a great contractor that you can work well with, that has good communication skills, coordinates well and who you can build a fine working relationship with is quite another experience. 

It goes without saying I'd recommend them without a doubt.

5,"I am very impressed by the spectacular new home Finecraft has constructed on Durbin Road in Bethesda.  The exterior & interior exhibit an exquisite & spacious design, & it is a welcome addition to our evolving older neighborhood."
5,"Claude C. Lapp Architects has recently had the pleasure of collaborating with Finecraft Contractors, Inc. on a renovation and large addition. The experience has been outstanding. George & Niko possess wonderful communication skills that guide projects along without a hitch. Their knowledge and passion for the industry are ever-present through every phase of construction. 

Over the years, we have been lucky to have worked with many of the area’s finest builders and contractors. Finecraft ranks among the top from our perspective. We look forward to working with them in the future."
5,"As a 25 year old Company, a window supplier such as ourselves have worked with thousands of remodelors locally. Finecraft Contractors have stood the test of time having more than a 20 year relationship with our company. This clearly speaks to the way they handle themselves professionally & work closely with their clients. The level of quality that they deliver every time ensures their future. Great companies such as this stay strong and busy making their Clients dreams become reality. We look forward for another 20 years & more."
5,"The details and craftsmanship in the work by Finecraft Contractors is exquisite. Being an Architectural Photographer, I see a lot of houses on a daily basis. I'm very impressed with the close attention to detail and the quality of the work that Finecraft has put into this beautiful house. It's truly a work of art and I'm excited to photograph more of their work."
5,"This project involved the complete renovation of the second and third (attic) floors of the back wing of our historic home, to create a master bedroom suite (with full bath and 2 walk-in closets), laundry area and linen closet on the second floor, and two bedrooms and a full bath on the attic floor.  It involved creating 2 new dormers and a new gable on the attic floor and installation of new windows.  Considerable upgrading of joists and rafters to meet modern codes was required in this historic home.  Great care was taken to ensure that all changes were consistent with the historic nature of this home, including custom-milled moldings and use of antique recovered heart pine flooring, among others.
Finecraft did an outstanding job on this project, as they have in previous experience with them on other projects on this property.  They took exceptional care to get the details of the finishing right.  The same experienced workers were present for the entire project.  They listened careful to any questions or concerns we had, and consulted frequently with us as the job progressed.  They were highly professional at all times, and it was a pleasure to have them in our house (we remained resident in the rest of the house throughout the renovation).  Their proposed cost for the project was reasonable, and the job came in at the agreed price, and we agreed to some minor change orders as the work progressed.  The project took about 6 months for completion, which was somewhat longer than anticipated but not unreasonable given the structural work involved.
Overall, I have the highest recommendation for Finecraft for their professionalism and the quality of their work, from their initial comments on the design and detailing through demolition, construction and finishing, to the final clean-up.  It was a pleasure to work with them and I recommend them unconditionally."
5,"They are my favorite! They always seem to make things right. Even when things are tough they work through them and the outcome is always amazing. They have worked on several projects in my house and all of which are excellent products which reflect the level of detailed work that epitomizes Finecraft. From smaller projects to larger ones, from my experience, I can guarantee they'll leave you satisfied with the job you contract them for, hands down!"
5,"Finecraft says it all! What an amazing company. Their detail to workmanship, customer service and setting the standards for quality standards all across the board is what they are all about. George the owner of the company sets the standards for perfection in all the building and project management and Niko sets the standards for customer service and high end marketing using the latest technical tools to stay up with the newest building trends. Their team members hold to all these standards which make it one of the best remodeling companies in the area. I would highly recommend Finecraft to anyone looking for a company to take care of all their building needs and to any architect or design firm that would like to collaborate with their services. You can't go wrong in working with this company.

5,"Finecraft provided on site inspection of 11 wooden window frames, including a bay window in the front and on the side of our townhouse.  They identified the areas with water damage, developed a scope of work, and provided an estimate for replacing the damaged wood with a PVC product.  Their estimate was far and away better than those provided by the other two contractors.  They then proceeded to compete the scope of work over a four-day period.

We were impressed from the beginning with the professionlism, customer relations, and communication with Finecraft.   Niko, their office manager/supervisor was very communicative, as was Mario the primary carpenter/repairman.  Mario and his co-worker, Henry, did a great job on all of the windows, some of which required a complex scaffold set-up.  The results were excellent.  We can now be assured of the integrity of those 11 window frames.

I will use Fincraft again and recommend them to others.  They did excellent work for us."
5,"Finecraft has done numerous projects in my house, including the installation of hardwood floors, staircases, bathroom renovations and the installation of French doors. Their work was impeccable, their estimates to the point and their timing on target. One of the few companies that both the owners and the workers have integrity on their business transactions, put the customer above everything else and perform the work seamlessly, even when there are problems.
They recently completed a deck Gazebo that the the jewel of my deck and house. As in the other projects, their work was impeccable, on time and professional."
5,"Finecraft recently renovated our basement family room, bathroom, and bedroom.  They transformed a boring, dark, subterranean basement into a beautiful light-filled, walk-out family room.  In addition to renovating the bathroom and upgrading the bedroom, they also created a project room.  The results are stunning.  Their organization and attention to detail resulted in a large scale project that moved smoothly, despite involving the skill of several tradesmen, all of whom are on staff with Finecraft (no subcontracting challenges).  We could not be happier with the results!"
5,"I have had the pleasure of working with the professionals of Finecraft Contractors, Inc for several years now. I have seen many of their stellar products in working with them. I believe the staff of Finecraft work very hard to ensure that the high quality of service they deliver is really conveyed by their marketing so that their prospective client knows what they have to offer. It is the quality in their service and in their projects which is stressed from the project manager to their marketing director and it shows."
4,They are very good with their job but expensive. They have great staff too! Be sure to specify anything you want for them if not you wont get it e.g if you want a bathroom be specific with every single detail you want in the bathroom down to the smallest detail like soap holder if not you wont get it. If you have the money and you desire a good job done call Finecraft!
4,"Great work, with nice attention to detail.  The workers were tidy, thorough, and professional.  Lovely design, over and above architect's rendering."
4,"Since the early 1990's, I, an architect, have teamed up with and worked on many fine residential projects all around the Washington, DC, metropolitan area, including my own house.  George Papahericles, the owner, brings great passion, honesty and energy to each of his well crafted projects."
5,"I've been following Finecraft Contractors, Inc. online for several years now and the work that I have seen is just absolutely outstanding. I so wish I could have them come down to Florida to work on my future home. The quality of the work is just top-notch and if you are looking for the best product and service, I'd highly recommend Finecraft! I've had the honor of meeting several their employees and they're such a pleasure to be around and they are very hard-working, reliable people. Like I said, I would hire them in a heartbeat."
5,"Finecraft Contractors recently completed the construction of my design for a garage with guest suite above.  The project was small but George Papaheraklis and his team gave it their full respect and attention. They were knowledgeable, detail oriented, and a pleasure to work with; I look forward to our next project together.

5,Finecraft has done some of the best quality jobs I´ve seen.  The company is composed of truly valuable people who deliver a fantastic product and a good experience.
5,Finecraft Contractors successfully completed 2 remodeling projects for me this year.  Total window replacement and renovation of 2 bathrooms. They completed the work on time and I was very satisfied with the outcome.  I would recommend them highly to any potential customer.
5,"We have collaborated with Finecraft on several projects and have been impressed with their integrity, client commitment, as well as the overall quality of their work.  Each of these projects were medium sized renovations with very complex design details.  George and his team always try hard to please the client.  We look forward to working with them again on future projects!"
5,"Finecraft does excellent work!  Extreme attention to detail
George has a very good eye and is very accommodating.
His crew have been with him for a long time.  That
iIs very important to me as an Interior Designer.  A 
Company is only as good as the people who 
work for them.  I highly recommend Finecraft Contractors."
5,"My first experience with Finecraft Contractors was when my clients selected George Papaheraklis and his team to complete the construction of a large renovation we designed in Chevy Chase.  From the meetings prior to the start of construction it was evident that George and his team have a high attention to detail.   

Having Finecraft’s experience to work through changes and modifications in the field made the process a lot easier for the client and myself.  I was continuously amazed with the depth of skills within Finecraft and their ability to self-perform a lot of the work in this whole house transformation.  I look forward to working with them on future projects."
5,"Finecraft built an addition on our home in 2006 and we asked them to renovate our kitchen which was just completed and is beautiful.  They are exceptionally focused on detail ... we had a need to adjust the design of the project mid-stream and they undertook the change without   complaint and at no extra charge.  They are easy to work with, reliable and courteous.  You just have to get used to the hammers going at 7:30am because they work a long hard day."
5,"House build in early 1970s. Contempoary design. We acquired in 1977. Project was from 5/2011 to 11/2011. We had some specific ideas at outset, like remodel kitchen and baths, but more general undeveloped ideas for other improvements, like consolidating a small unused balcony room into a walk-in closet and enlarged bathroom. We moved out for 3 months. We never had any issues with Finecraft Contractors in clarity of work, the  timeliness of completing projects , or billings. We did not use an architect or interior designer. Instead we relied upon Finecraft to recommend enhancements we did not see or think about, which was a brilliant decision on our part. Finecraft (George in particular) had the ability to visualize a change which could be made to enhance a rooms appearance, and in many instances with little added costs. For example outside windows for an expanded master bathroom, or remaking a large outdated family room with a cathedral ceilng into a  dazzling room. We would recommend them without exception and use them again. It was indeed a pleasant experience. We continue to enjoy to this day their work"
5,"As a kitchen and Bath designer with 25 years of experience, I have worked with many different contractors.  Finecraft is one of the best that I have ever worked with.  They are true professionals and make all of my designs come to life for our clients.  I have hired them to do work on my own home and would not hesitate to recommend them for any project, large or small."
5,"As an Architect, I've had the pleasure of working with Finecraft Contractors and been able to count on George Papaheraklis' experience and knowledge on a couple of occasions.  Finecraft Contractors' work embodies the company's name in as much as the end result of their labors can truly be qualified as fine craft. George's and his crew's professionalism is apparent from the planning stages to the execution of the final punch list. I look forward to collaborating in the future with George and his firm and would recommend his services to our future clients at  plan Z  a r c h i t e c t s."
5,"Finecraft is an excellent home builder and home remodeling general contractor in the Washington, DC region. I have worked them them on at least 10 significant projects over as many years. What sets them apart are 4 strengths:
1. Their commitment to be faithful to the design created on paper and   not deviate from it without sufficient cause.
2. Their commitment to maintain a customers trust and confidence with them during the course of the work.
3. Their technical expertise makes for an enjoyable building process.
4. Above all else, their ability to finish a project strongly and completely. Customers naturally expect this but it is not all that common in the remodeling industry. It takes a highly committed professional general contractor that is adequately compensated to achieve this."
5,"Owner George Papaheraklis is close to finishing our second project.  One was demolishing a kitchen and family room, and making a single space with a ""bump out"" for a breakfast area.  Neighbors who know our community are amazed when they see it.  We have now gutted an old-style bathroom, vanity area and modest walkin closet and are making a larger integrated bathroom with a bigger walk in closet.

What distinguishes George is that he is an artist with a keen eye.  Not only will he tweak an architect's plans for aesthetic and functional reasons, but even as the project is in midstream, he is consstantly thinking, ""perhaps we should do it this way (a frame around tiling) or switch a regular door to a pocket door or change the orientation of the stall shower glass door. He obsesses about little details and, in the long run, that makes a big difference.

I found out about Finecraft in the house of a friend where George had gutted the back of the house and added on to it.  I had no doubt about the big picture and the attention to detail.  If any reader could see a typical Finecraft project up close, he would not have to rely on ramblings like this---he would see the work and know all he needs to know to hire the company."
5,"Finecraft Contractors completely revamped our family room.  Tore out old dated paneling, and 'popcorn' ceiling.  Now it is not all chopped up looking and it is calming to look into it.  Also they made custom bookcases on the sides of the fireplace that have ample storage below and great display space above.  I'm very pleased with the results and the respectful people who came into our home to do this work."
5,"Finecraft is an excellent construction company and a pleasure to work with.  George Papaherkalis has an excellent sense of design and constructions, his crews are skilled, and the final product is enjoyable space to live in.  I have hired them five times over 25 years and would use them again."
5,"Finecraft is an excellent company to work with.  Honest, reliable, creative, dependable and of course the attention to all the details are second to none, The crew are hard working and respectful. George is an inspiration and works so hard to come up with the best possible solutions for his clients.  The team thinks creatively and out of the box which is so unusual.  This is especially important in an historic renovation where sensitivity to the integrity of the house is key to bringing it back to life.
I would highly recommend 
George and his team."
5,Finecraft built us a brand new home from scratch and I could not have been happier with the work.  The attention to detail was outstanding and they were so nice and communicated so well with us throughout the process.  I would highly recommend them to anybody.
4,"When I work with George and his team of builders, I know that the final product is going to be beautiful.  He gets the details right, he understands our design goals, and he puts his heart and soul into the work.

5,"I have worked with Finecraft Contractors as a supply and design resource, on many projects over the years. George is very creative, exceptionally thoughtful, and he listens carefully and intently to the needs of his clients. He makes each project collaborative and enjoyable - always with the goal of getting the best result for his clients. He stays current on the latest in design and material possibilities, with a particular passion for quality construction. I would highly recommend George for any of your construction and design requirements"
5,"I am an architect that has worked with Finecraft on several residential projects and they do an excellent job.  Their craftsmanship and attention to detail is superb.  They are able to think in architectural terms and their sense of design and aesthetics is very reliable.  Their management of the construction process is well thought out, and benefits from years of experience.

On the contractual side, Finecraft is very good at negotiating the cost of a project, providing valuable input for economy and buildability without cutting corners.  

I find the whole Finecraft team a pleasure to work with.  I am happy to serve as a reference if necessary, and prospective clients may contact me at Studio One Architects (301.946.4601).  Robert Smith, Principal."
5,"I hired Finecraft to add a sunroom, new roof, portico and remodel 2 bathrooms. The work has been excellent with a foreman present at all times. The workmen are pleasant and helpful. They adhere to the highest standards in their work and I recommend them without reservation."
5,Finecraft built our house in 2012.  They did great work.  Really cared about our project and our family and it showed in the final project.
5,"I had the pleasure of hiring Finecraft for a project recently that called for the addition of an outdoor living area to my home. The level of detail and commitment to quality was unsurpassed. These are Craftsmen, not contractors.
It shows in every project they create.

5,"We had Barron do a complicated addition and remodel that added a bathroom and expanded the footprint of the house. No, they definitely were not the least expensive bid we got on the project. But they did really nice work, mostly on time and within budget (we expanded the scope of the project midway through, which added to the final cost and completion date). We were nervous going in, because friends of ours with similar or even smaller projects would complain about things taking much longer than promised and being ghosted for days by their project managers.

Fortunately, that wasn't the case with Barron. Leeran, the project manager, was very communicative and flexible, responding quickly to questions and issues while helping us stay within budget and make the most of what we could spend. Thanks to the company's willingness to work with us, we were able to stay in the house during the majority of the project — it wasn't easy for the construction crew to work around us (and our furniture), but it saved us a lot of money and allowed us to splurge in areas that were important to us.

We did run into a few problems along the way, but Leeran was very responsive and got things fixed or re-done quickly. As worried as we were about ballooning costs, unpleasant surprises and the project dragging on and on, I can't say enough how pleasantly surprised we were.

The addition is beautiful and the house is much more functional and enjoyable. (And our teenage daughter is thrilled to have her own bathroom.)"
1,"I'm very unhappy with my experience with Baron. We worked on a 1000 sq ft remodel that took over a year when it was originally quoted for 3-6 months. Months after, I'm still trying to clean up the mess they left me with and the damages they made to my house. It was a headache and complete stress working with them. They are the nightmare remodel that I hear others talk about. Our project managers did not remembered anything that was discussed and there was little to no follow through. They would say they were going to do something, or that this is how it would look, but then when it's done it's completely different and not what was discussed. Every meeting with the project managers ended up being pointless. I had to escalate many issues to the main office, and the owner, Mike, in order to get some type of acknowledgement, explanation or answer. HVAC was installed incorrectly, exterior hole in the wall was not repaired correctly, crew did not know how to install our cabinets, incorrect measurements which affected cabinet order and window order which was not returnable, patio furniture used as work benches, patio and yard used as a dumping ground, etc. We were the points that had to point out the issues and then argue with them to get it resolved when these are very simple things that should just be done correctly in the first place. Follow the manual, follow what city inspector expects, etc. I can't imagine the customers who don't know any better and assume things are okay when there could be bigger issues caused to their house in the long run."
5,"Finding a contractor that does quality work and is reliable is rare. My husband and I decided to remodel  90% of my childhood home and after meeting with six contractors, it was clear from the beginning that we wanted to work with Leeran. He was always prompt to our meetings/calls, explained things in an easily digestible manner, and was honest. 

This project was insanely important to my family as we had a lot of memories in the old home and the Baron crew created a new, modern home for us to make new memories in with our toddler. Leeran was one of the big reasons why our project got done on time (especially impressive during COVID) as he was extremely responsive. Anytime we had a question or needed his advice during the project, he was there to help answer questions, explain the timeline, help facilitate and project manage timelines with the crew/vendors, etc. 

We also worked with Noya, one of their interior designers, and she was so sweet and helpful in designing our home. She attended multiple meetings with us to understand our design aesthetic, shop with us for finishes (kitchen, tile, countertop), etc. 

I have been recommending Baron the entire time we’ve been working with them. Their work is top notch and having a PM dedicated to your project is a game changer. My husband and I are working parents with a toddler, so it was less stressful and not as overwhelming having Leeran help steer the project for us."
5,"I had a great experience working with Leeran and the Baron constructions. Our project was based in Sunnyvale while we were living in San Francisco with a less than two year old toddler, in the middle of the pandemic. We were redoing 2/3rd of our home which entailed large structural changes. We knew this wasn't going to be easy and we wanted to go with the best in the area. 

For day 1, Leeran and the firm were punctual, outright honest and very collaborative making them one of the most dependable contractors I've ever worked with. In the early days, I remember brainstorming layouts with Leeran late into the night over zoom. He was always very accommodating, open to creative ideas and sharing this experience to keep the project feasible. When it came to quotes, while Baron was a bit on the higher side, I knew I was going to get what I'm paying for. So we decided to go with them. 

The project had a very tight deadline as our lease in SF was ending in March and we were starting this project in early October. Leeran stayed on top of it throughout. Even when there were hiccups like when we found out our ducts needed to be replaced and one of our structural beam was infected with termites, Leeran added more workforce instead of pushing out the finish date. Leeran has a fabulous team of people he works with. From the architect to the designer, everyone was such a pleasure to work with. From finalizing permits to ordering finished materials, everything was so systematic and well planned that I'm afraid I'm spoiled for life. 

The final product of their work was above and beyond my expectations. When I shared the photos with my friends and family, I had to convince them that they are not photoshopped. (Checkout out the Kitchen & Bathrooms Design & Remodel project from Sunnyvale)

I highly recommend Leeran and Baron Constructions. If I had to do it all over again, I'd go with Barons again."
5,"We started working with Baron Construction this year on a multi-stage project and we are about to complete Phase I of it - a full Kitchen/Living room remodel to a modern farmhouse. Leeran is our Project Manager throughout the project.  Overall I am very happy with the work so far and how the new Kitchen / Living room area is shaping up.

Like any renovation project there are surprises and complexities you encounter along the way - and while not everything always goes according to original plan, I truly appreciate working on this with Leeran - we are able to work through it together, evaluate different ideas an options and were able come up with reasonable solutions to all problems along the way. I also appreciate the completeness of the work and ensuring we get a higher quality finished product which meets code - Leeran ensures the work is done right above everything else.

I look forward to continuing our work together in Phase II of the project."
5,"They rebuilt our shower to exacting specifications. We are in love with the resulting artwork, which is sturdy and beautiful. I highly recommend the services."
5,There is a lot of unethical behavior on the part of the staff. They do not respond to calls and don't care about the customers. I had a very bad experience!
5,"This company's service is overpriced, and their staff is unprofessional. It is a shady business and I regret choosing them. They have been refusing to give me a refund for two weeks. The service has been inconvenient for me."
1,"BUYER BEWARE - If you are thinking of hiring Baron Construction (Or, David) to do any major work - think twice! The company is a complete disaster and incompetence. They don't understand architectural or structural plans or even care about doing so. 
On their website Baron Construction claim that ""We are LA's premier Design-Build Contractor with over 55+ years of combined experience."", but their presence in the SF Bay Area is a mess.
Their approach is to sign you up for a high-premium contact, and then hire half-cost subcontractors and provide zero supervision to any work. Subcontractors do whatever they think, sometimes not even up to Code, with zero guidance or supervision from GC. Subcontractors make costly mistakes, for which Baron Construction will charge you. Subcontractors damage expensive finishing materials and nobody at Baron Construction takes responsibility! Don't bother. Take your money somewhere else where you will get quality, communication, and responsibility. We hired Baron Construction to build our dream home, and with the project still unfinished, it turned to be a nightmare all way along. Baron Construction had promised us completion in 9 months but turned it into over 2.5 years project. We had no choice but to fire Baron Construction and it took other General Contractor a long time to correct all mistakes Baron Construction and its subcontractors had made."
5,"Have you ever envisioned and dreamed of improving your home?! We have for a very long time! And with the help of a talented Baron team, and great delegation by Sean, the project manager, we’re now living in our dream home! Despite many setbacks this year, due to pandemic, Baron team made our vision a reality!"
5,"We hired the Baron team to turn our historic San Jose craftsman house into our dream home and could not be happier.  It was a major project, including converting an unfinished low-ceiling basement into permitted living space, an addition to the main floor, and rebuilding most of the structure while keeping some of the original redwood bones and craftsman charm that other builders didn’t want to touch.  Ron and Eli have been with us every step of the way, from architectural drawings and shepherding plans through the city, to major excavation and framing, now to the last finishing touches.  Whether Baron employees or hired subcontractors, everyone on the job has done top notch work and displayed pride in their craft.  Big shout outs to Salvador the framer for stopping at nothing short of perfection and to Courtney the interior designer for helping turn our ideas into a reality beyond our dreams.  We will be raising our family in a beautiful home and creating many memories for years to come.  Thank you Baron!"
5,"Our home was built in the 1950s and needed some major work.  What started as the wish to add central heat turned into a entire home remodel with the help of Baron.  We bid out several companies for plans, and Ron was personable, kind & asked great leading questions.  He returned with three options (Good / Better / Best) and provided the reasoning behind them all.  He was knowledgeable of the requirements of our city, plus had great suggestions on how to better our ideas.  

In the end, we ended up adding 400 square feet, plus brought the entire home down to the studs.  We updated everything - from the roof, to plumbing, to electrical, to the stucco around the house.  The end product is absolutely gorgeous, and we are thrilled with the work that was done.  

The project completed on time - and although over budget, it was due to unforeseen circumstances (lead / asbestos) and beautiful add ons like our newly vaulted great room ceiling and front of the house upgrade.  The on time portion was essential though - as with SIP starting due to COVID-19, we were able to return to our home from the small apartment we were staying in.  Ron kept the team on schedule and pushed hard to ensure we could come back ASAP.  

I highly recommend Baron - especially Ron as the PM on the job.  Between his ability to keep the project on schedule, and Courtney's amazing eye for interior design - we are proud to have our kitchen & master bath featured on Baron's website: Home Expansion & Renovation"
5,"Very professional, prompt, and they do great work! Highly recommended. Obi was always reachable by phone and responded promptly to all queries. Extremely pleased."
5,"We remodeled our 30-year old kitchen and appreciate the job that Baron did.  We especially appreciate the work of Obi, the Project Manager, who kept track of the various sub-contractors and their schedules.  As with any remodeling project there were hiccups along the way, and his sense of humor and commitment to quality helped us a lot.  We love the finished product."
5,"I used Baron for design & build for a master suite (bedroom & bath) addition on my house.    They did a great job.  The quality of work was high and they worked through a number of unexpected challenges that popped up along the way.  The project took a bit longer than originally expected, but very happy with the final results."
5,"Baron is great to work with. They are respectful and responsive and their work turned out great! They have experts in lighting, plumbing, etc."
5,"We worked with Baron Construction and specifically project manager Ron Hogen to remodel our 120 year old Victorian home. It was a long and complicated project, that was basically a gut job for a significant portion of the house - involved a completely new kitchen great room (relocated the kitchen to a new part of the house), laundry room, bedroom, 3 bathrooms, butler pantry, finished basement and more. Now as I sit in my beautiful new and sparkling kitchen great room, I can whole-heartedly recommend Ron and Baron Construction for your project. Looking back on our project - yes there were ups and downs, and some challenges, as you would expect with the extent of our project, especially given we lived in the house through most of it. However, Ron maintained open communication and transparency throughout. He was dedicated, responsive, and accommodating. Their price was extremely competitive, and in the end they finished very close to the original bid, (most of the change orders were initiated by us). We are happy with the quality of their work, and they didn't close the project until all the final minor adjustments were perfect. We will be calling them for any future projects."
5,"I was very pleased with baron construction, especially Etel’s project management. She was very professional and accommodated our quick turn with this remodel. She was attentive with my concerns and responded quickly with questions. If something didn’t work, Etel went beyond to do the research to figure out a solution. I would recommend Etel to anyone."
5,"My wife and I needed one of our bedrooms completely re-built (flooring, ceiling, walls, insulation, painting) AND we wanted to completely renovate the attached bathroom. For starters, I will admit I am extremely particular. I scheduled consultation appointments with 5 contractors, all of which had great reviews on Yelp and other sites. From prior personal experience and friends' experiences with contractors, their reputation on the street is not that great (poor communication, lack of timeliness, etc). After all the consultations, I decided to go with Baron Construction. For the record, they were not the cheapest, but their offer was fair and I felt good about our project manager, Leeran Shlomo. Our project is now complete and I have to say I feel very good about selecting Baron Construction and Leeran Shlomo. Leeran proved to be anything other than the contractor stereotypes I mentioned above. He was personable, friendly, a GREAT communicator, and he made himself available almost anytime (even before 8 am and up until 10 pm at night sometimes). His customer service was superb. I would highly recommend Baron Construction and this is almost directly attributable to our experience with Leeran Shlomo. The project manager can make your life really smooth or miserable. Leeran managed our project extremely well and kept us updated almost daily. If you can select Leeran, I would highly, highly recommend him! He's awesome!"
2,"Never gave them the contract. Just too expensive. Got 3 more quotes from licensed and bonded contractors and trust me they were 8 times more expensive. 
Maybe they are good at doing fabulous job but I’ll settle at 95% great job at 1/8th the price. 
2 stars for the “project manager” who was patient, spent time to understand needs."
5,"My husband and I decided to renovate our kitchen. After getting some estimates, we decided to choose Baron construction. This job included removing a wall, two fireplaces, all cabinets, countertops and appliances and then installing new fireplace, cabinets, quartz waterfall island, quartz countertops and backsplash. 

Every construction project has some hiccups here and there, ultimately it's the end products that count. We are very pleased with our new kitchen and fireplace. The quartz for the island was cut and installed wonderfully. Wow factors are definitely there.

An incremental payment schedule was provided. All changes during the project were itemized and approved by us prior to work. We paid as various stages of the work were completed.

Overall, We are happy with the way our kitchen turned out and we could not be more pleased with Baron Construction and all the products of their team's work."
5,"My project manager, Lital, was beyond fabulous.  She was both professional and personal.  Professional in every aspect from start to finish and yet personal in the way she listened to me and put my wants and needs at the forefront.  I would absolutely call her again if the need would ever arise.  Cant say enough good things about her and how she handled my project."
5,"We just completed a complicated kitchen remodel and full bath remodel with Baron Construction.  The project was completed on time, actually early, and for the most part within budget.  There are always a few surprises with a project dealing with an 80 year old house and constraints imposed by our first major remodel a number of years ago, not to mention current building codes.  Our project manager Eli and his assistant Obi where wonderful to work with and the Baron’s management model is unique and ensures positive communication and rapid problem solving throughout the project process.  Further, the actual work did not start until all critical decisions were made and key materials in place or their delivery date assured, e.g. new kitchen cabinets.  This was essential to project timing and minimizing our disruption. 

In addition, the on site construction crew was amazing.  They were there every day, as promised, and a pleasure to have in our house.  Fernando is a master craftsman and even the Palo Alto building inspector told us (in front of Fernando) that he was an amazing builder who did everything according to best practices and worked to perfection. He solves problems and is so conscientious. What a prize Baron has in Fernando....and those who work with him as well. 

Our new kitchen cabinets had to to fit exact specifications for a variety of reasons and this was very important to us.  Eli and Obi did meticulous measurements and the cabinet makers did an excellent job as did the installers, Marco and Carlos.  They worked hard to have the cabinets just perfectly placed. They were true perfectionists. 

Eli and Obi were more than fair in listening to our requests and satisfying our needs.  They worked around our schedule to insure work timing was handled correctly.  And, when the few problems did occur, the Baron’s team was on top of them and they were resolved to keep the project on track and meet our specific needs. 

The contract for the work was fair.  The only real issue for us was that the allowances were somewhat low.  We went over because we selected more expensive products. We would encourage more generous allowances with the contract budget adjusted accordingly. 

Overall we could not be more pleased with Baron Construction, their management team and all the products of their full team’s work.  We are thrilled with our finished product and would certainly use Baron again. A big Thank You!!!"
5,"Baron rebuilt our shower to exacting specifications after a previous tile replacement done with another contractor failed just like the original tile.  The resulting work is sturdy and beautiful, and we couldn't be happier with the results.

We had the pleasure of working with Eddie on project management and Lucas as our foreman.  Both Eddie and Lucas were very prompt, professional, and knowledgeable.  Any time we had a question, they were available to answer.  Although it didn't have any material effect on the job, we also really enjoyed just chatting with Eddie and Lucas when they were around.  Everyone we dealt with felt warm and genuine and it made the whole process a lot more pleasant.

Now, the work wasn't cheap and we did have some overruns on time estimates, but nothing outrageous.  When something would go longer than expected, Eddie always kept us in the loop as to why.

All things considered, we would absolutely use Baron again and would recommend them to anyone who's willing to pay for great craftsmanship."
5,"Craftsmanship at Baron Construction is world class!  We had the pleasure of working with project manager Ron who worked with us from project definition all the way till the everything was fully completed including the professional power wash to remove any type of debris on the drive way.  Ron was with us every step of the way throughout the project and was always super responsive via phone/email/txt.   In addition, Ron always came over to check-in with us to ensure we're happy with the progress and accommodated to our busy schedule by coming in later in the evenings after we're done with the kids' dinner.

We contacted Baron in Dec 2017 when we purchased our home and wanted them to update 3 of the bathrooms.  After a walk through of the existing bathrooms, measurements were taken and we received a formal detailed quote.  The 2nd best aspect (the best being their quality of work) of working with Baron is how they never nickle and dimed us - what we paid for the project was exactly what they quoted at the start + fair adjustments due to us adding wet-walls in 2 of the bathrooms (which we didn't want initially when we started the project).

The only criticism we had with Baron is the length of time it took the finish the bathrooms. We were originally told it'd take 3-4 months and it ended up taking 6 months.  Part of that is our fault because we had guests over and had to stop construction for a couple of weeks which caused downstream delays. The wait was well worth it because the masterful work of Sergio (who does tiles) was simply amazing.  Overall we were extremely happy with the way the bathrooms turned out so we just wanted to take a few mins to acknowledge their amazing work here on Houzz!"
4,We recently had our bathroom remodeled and hired baron construction. Everyone was professional and courteous. We were very happy with the results and would recommend to others.
5,"As a Realtor my responsibility is to my clients. When my sellers wanted to do improvements to their investment property in preparation for Sale we chose Barron Construction for the job they were AMAZING! they took all the headache out of the renovation they acquired the permits,offered insight to the design and materials and even when we hit budget snag they were able to accommodate Eli and his team were super professional and skilled. The property sold before ever hitting the market while under construction and was over our target price all cash 7 day close. Everybody was happy. Will definitely call on them when I have another project. And so should you."
5,"I interviewed Mike Baron, owner of Baron Construction & Remodeling Co, to remodel my ranch style home to an up to date open concept look. I knew within 10 minutes that this was going to be a good working relationship and I was going to hire his company for this project. The first thing that impressed me was I had a long list of things I wanted done and he glanced at it, put it aside and just listened to my ideas. We did a walk through the house and the first thing he noticed was the foundation in the TV room was sloping and needed to be replaced. This was not on my list but he recommended this be my first priority and I’m glad I agreed. The moldy musty smell that was plaguing me disappeared and the floor is now even. 

I was fortunate to have Mike work with me on the whole project. As a client I appreciated the consistency and confidence working with one person and helping with the design and selection of materials. This was very important to me and high on my list. I also appreciated working with the same onsite people when possible.

The scope of the project entailed new wood floors, crown molding and baseboards throughout the house. A beautiful custom fitted cabinet under a wall mounted TV with matching floating shelves in the front room. 

The entryway into the kitchen was enlarged to give it the open concept look I wanted. The kitchen was enhanced with a quartz countertop, sink, beautiful backsplash, shaker cabinets/drawers and hardware.

Replacing the old brick with natural stone and a streamline mantle changed the existing fireplace.

The master shower was gutted and replaced with a decorative mosaic tile strip, large complimentary tiles for the shower walls and bathroom floor, frameless glass shower doors and an infinity drain. The mosaic tile was also used as the backsplash behind the bathroom sinks and an area behind the toilet. 

The interior walls were freshly painted with an accent wall in the living room and TV room. The exterior of the house took on a whole new look with a change of color. 

I do want to qualify that it appears that the project took a long time but this was my decision not the contractor. We have two additional projects that will be completed this year and I will be finished with my long dream list!

So the questions are: Would I hire Baron Construction & Remodeling Co again; would I recommend this company to others; Am I happy with the results? Answer: Absolutely."
2,"I wish I could give only 1 star; the 2nd star is for what they have done right. I read through all the spectacular reviews below so I chose them, but ended up really painful experience which will be unforgettable once in my life time. This is a really long story I have with them. 

Mike appears to be a nice guy and promise whatever you ask; claim they could deliver your dream project. But when coming down to day-to-day project execution, it will be your big nightmare and you are doomed if you go with them.

I just finished a very large addition project with them and the following are the pitfalls:
1) the contract only lists the major items but not down to all the details. In the beginning they alluded that they always write contract this way and not worry about the details; but later on when specific details were requested they argued that those were not included in the contract and would be considered as change order items for extra cost.
2) no interior designer provided: in the contract they promised to offer an interior designer to complete my ideas and discuss all the details to select proper fixtures for my huge addition project. However the first 2 designers quit after first contact; the 3rd one agreed to take this job but couldn't receive my ideas accurately nor complete the design in the booked time frame. I ended up doing the rough design on my own with limited knowledge without any professional assistance. Had to decide and made all the purchases myself. This is in disagreement to the contract.
3) upon signing the contract they claimed they would have 4-6 people on the job site everyday; but that only happened in the first 2 weeks. After 2-3 months they began to not have full crew working full time on your project. On some days even no one showed up due to various excuses. Then the GC began to take vacations or go out of town for personal issues.
4) They claim to progress very fast so they want you to have all the fixtures ready or some jobs would be delayed in order to wait for the parts. So I had to get almost all parts early on in a short time but then realized they'd reach that task much later.
5) Very poor in communication. They send multiple people to interface with you and they are sometime inconsistent within themselves. Not all the parties are on the same page all the time. You need to deal with different people with different personalities and responsibility in one project. And the real working contractors are another different group of people.
6) They'd break the fixtures you buy. The stuff are all stored in the garage before getting used; after long time they may not be able to find specific parts you prepared and claim them missing, or parts may get scratched or broken due to careless handling so you end up buying same items twice.
7) The raining season came before the roof was installed, and they didn't do proper treatment to prevent water damage. Only simple tarp was laid on the frame which collapsed in the evening storm and my existing living room was flooded because the rain leaked through the roof/wall crack they made. When I expressed my concern to them regarding the water-damaged wood frame/wall/floor, they simply shrugged it off saying it'd dry out over time. If they are real professional they should know that the water-damaged wood will be distorted and becomes very hard even after drying out. And the wall will not be evenly flat and becomes wavy in some sections.
8) the floor in the extended living room area is not level with the existing flooring. The flooring was fully renewed in the integrated living room but you can feel the slope in the extended area. When the issue was brought to them Mike first said he'd send some other guy to investigate it; then that guy simply said he couldn't feel the difference and attributed it to the new wood accommodation. 
9) they may do well if your project is quite standardized in that everything just gets replaced without any particular design change. With not too many customization your project would be delayed. In the beginning they claimed to complete my project in 6 months; then it ended up to take 13 months.
10) their secretary's attitude is very poor. When they want to collect payment they want it right away and would harass you in email. But when you request them to fix something they'd have various personal excuses. 

Above are just the major pitfalls what I could remember after 13 months; there are so many miscellaneous minor complains which I cannot list them all. After all, if you choose them, you won't have peace in mind during your project and the journey will be winding, as they are not professional enough to handle projects in modern style."
5,"I worked with Baron Construction & Remodeling Co. on several occasions photographing projects they completed. Each time I was able to witness first-hand uncompromised quality of their work: the beautiful, functional designs, attention to the smallest details, happy home owners. I am confident to recommend their services to even more discerning clients."
5,"I would highly recommend Baron Construction & Remodeling.  We were working with another GC to add a bathroom and new kitchen.  The project was to have been completed in eight months.  Instead it took more than a year and a half and the project was still not completed. My husband and I were very stressed and frustrated as the GC and workers did not show up to work everyday.  
Baron Construction was doing a remodel for three of my neighbors.  They were all very happy with Baron Construction.  We decided to part ways with our GC. Mike decided to help us finish our project so we would pass our final inspection. Needless to say, we were  very happy and relieved to be working with Mike Baron.  He checked the job site often and saw that things ran very smoothly for us.  Everyone from the job crew to the office staff is very professional, friendly, and efficient.  Very happy with the quality of their work. Each project has been completed in a timely manner. We still have little projects that they are helping us correct from the last GC.  I would highly recommend them."
5,"My wife and I wanted our old home to wear a new look. So, we consulted the Mike of Baron Construction- with his crew- to make our dream come true. The task was deftly executed, and each day ends with a general cleaning even till the last day of the work. Our experience with them was quite awesome – every time they resume work, the atmosphere seems like a family reunion, Mike and his crew diffuse warmth and friendliness each day. Now, our home is a place of regular visit for our friends. All thanks to Mike and his crew for their best shot that changed our old house forever into the best we can ever think of."
5,"I can't say enough how helpful Eli Levy and Mike Baron were in our construction project. We started with a master bath and kids bath remodel, but the project soon expanded to the entire upstairs. Eli and crew were easy to work with, extremely detail oriented, and had great suggestions throughout the process. Even as we expanded the scope of our project, Eli kept the project moving and we were quickly finished with an entire floor remodel. We couldn't be more happy with the results and even look forward to our next project."
5,"We really enjoyed our remodeling process with Baron. We interviewed a couple of contractors and are glad that we made the right choice. Eli has been really pleasant to work with from the very beginning through the end. He is responsive, professional and paid attention to details. Luis and Emilio, who worked onsite were fairly hard-working and friendly. Though it took a bit longer and extra rework to install the tiles perfectly, it was an overall smooth and efficient process. We love our freshly updated home when we wake up every morning."
5,"I never thought that remodeling could be as hassle-free as Mike and his team made it to be. Last year, my husband and I had a grand plan to remodel our kitchen. We had been getting into cooking and loved entertaining that we felt it was time to make the plunge! I learned about Baron Construction from a friend who spoke very highly of them. All I can say is that our decision to get our kitchen remodeled and to work with Mike has been ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS for our family ever. The whole process went by smoothly. We set up an estimate and then they promptly started with the work. They made the house very livable and they were there to answer any questions. Now the finished product was wonderful! I don't know how we could have waited this long for the kitchen remodel. We got our dream kitchen and even if our home was built in 1988, it made our house look brand new. The cost was reasonable and very worth it due to high quality. Very satisfied and I cannot wait to get other parts of the home done by Mike and team too."
5,"Of all my years managing my home, i have never encountered a contractor as reliable, creative and efficient as Baron Construction. These folks are the best and i would only trust remodeling my home with them! They worked on my kitchen, guest bedroom and living room and kept the place clean throughout the process. It was very liveable to come home. They respected the place and did a fantastic final job at a great price! I never knew my kitchen could look like one out of the magazines but they gave very useful design advice. I would get them again for all future jobs! Communication was polite and very consistent as well. Six stars!!!"
5,"I am not a fan of remodeling projects. I am always worried that the time and effort is too tedious for our household, given that I work full time and manage a small business. Mike and the team at Baron changed all of this. Remodeling was hassle-free because they kept the entire house clean throughout the process. They listened to us about what design we wanted and delivered on it. Everytime we had a question, the team was always one call away. I never thought our bathroom and masters bedroom can look as beautiful as it is now. Next: my kitchen! I will only trust them. Great value for money. Prices are on point and you can see the high quality."
5,"I used Baron for an extensive kitchen remodeling job, as well as new flooring and ceilings.  The management of the job was excellent, with lots of design advice and guidance, flexibility in accomodating my personal choices, and high level of expertise in all phases and areas of the job, which included complete demolition of the existing kitchen, installing all rough plumbing and electrical, new flooring (tile and wood), new cabinetry, and painting throughout.  Eli, especially, was terrific at managing the whole thing. The crew was always respectful and courteous."
5,"When you work with Mike, Eli, Oded and Cheryl, you get great customer service and amazing work. I've tried other contractors in the past, but the quality of their work is literally the BEST in the market. Highly recommend!"
5,"My bathroom called for a much-needed makeover... I had been thinking about it for years. I heard from a friend that renovating bathroom would increase value of the house, so I said game let's do it. I asked around for the best contractors in the South Bay and instantly got drawn to the team of Mike and Eli of Baron Construction in Saratoga. From my first inquiry, they were patient with taking me through the entire process.  They came promptly for a free estimate. They listened to my design and gave valuable inputs. They were experts in constructing and were very efficient way - being sensitive to my budget and true to my vision. The construction came and went and it was a breeze! I did not stress about anything because they guided me throughout the process - plumbing, design, materials, labor! I couldn't be happier with the end result. My bathroom is exactly how I imagined it and more. I will definitely call them again for my future projects. THEY ARE THE BEST!"
5,"Best re-modelers in the Bay Area! They are extremely trustworthy, no hidden costs and are patient in answering any questions. I showed them a picture of my dream kitchen and everything exceeded my expectations - the finish seems very good, the lighting is perfect and the paint is amazing! They know their design stuff. These guys are the real deal."
5,Baron Construction has made my dream home a reality! I never thought my patio and living room had the potential to be a designer home but they did it. At a very reasonable price too. Very satisfied with the work!!!
5,"Baron woah , just  woahhh ! amazing work done by guyz . love you guyz, i'd prefer to hire you again, one of my favourites in Saratoga , 
me & my wife wants new kitchen,  you guyz did the job very well, great work indeed"

5,"Eli Levy of Baron Construction and his crew, Luis and Fernando, did an outstanding kitchen remodel – on time and within budget! Eli was very patient with our first major renovation and helped us pick out flooring, cabinets and handles, backsplash, countertops, sink, disposal, and lighting. Moreover, he also brought the walls, insulation, electrical, the junction box and smoke/CO detectors up to code in the original time estimated. Luis and Fernando were polite and worked long hours to finish their projects, letting us know when they were starting or finishing for the day. They cleaned up at the end of every day and Eli gave the kitchen a professional cleaning at the end. They even did little extras like putting in a dimmer switch and installing an under-the-counter toaster oven. Our most positive renovation ever and I hardly recommend Eli, Luis, Fernando and Baron Construction.

5,"Baron Construction & Remodeling is the BEST contractor that I have EVER worked with. The quality of workmanship is beyond excellent. They were constantly in touch with us making sure we were satisfied with the work in process. If we had a question they would immediately respond. Fantastic Customer Care!! So if you want to have a ""Wow"" experience with a contractor just give them a call."
5,"My husband and I have been wanting to redo our kitchen and we finally had the opportunity to do so earlier this year. Since we have never done any renovation project before, we decided to research online and found a website that allowed us to reach out to several companies. We collected 5 companies, one of which is Baron Construction. They were the first one to contact us via email. We narrowed our choices down to three companies and set up appointments to meet with them. We met Eli and we immediately connected. We had a vision of how we wanted our kitchen to be and this is something ""out of the box"". Eli understood our vision despite it being different from most of his clients' and he assured us every step of the way that he will carry out this vision. This was very important to us. Bottom line is, after 8 weeks of patience, our kitchen turned out to be what we had envisioned it to be. Eli and Baron Construction delivered what they promised to deliver and we are very happy with the result. We have since hosted parties at our home and have received very positive feedback on the kitchen. We will not hesitate to recommend Eli and Baron Construction to my friends and family. Keep up the good work."
5,"As remodeling jobs go, ours was rather small (under $50K) but you would never know that from the attention we received from Mike and Eli at Baron Construction. We had a minor problem with one of their sub-contractors, but it was resolved immediately and the bottom line is that the job was done in a timely manner and we are extremely pleased with the results. Mike's design suggestions were spot-on and without them, the results would not have been as good as they were."
5,"While we did not hire Baron Construction for our current project given a pre-existing relationship with another contractor, we were very impressed by the professionalism and responsiveness of this company. We contacted several firms and Baron stood out. Jesse came to our home for an initial consultation and immediately followed up with another visit to go through the proposal in detail - and we found both the proposed scope and budget to be very fair. We will definitely consider Baron in the future."
5,"My parents shopped around for a while before Baron Co and Remodeling. They made it worth the search. Very respectful of our ideas, and the kitchen was finished with great attention to detail. Would recommend them to anyone. May use them again for a bathroom
In the future."
5,"My partner and I contracted Baron Construction after we bought our home.  I was referred to him by a friend, since she had previously hired him to do a bathroom upgrade. Our wash room and kitchen needed an upgrade for what seemed to be the longest. The previous owners had done little to no work on the house. He did an amazing job. Both, my partner and I were left satisfied from the work done on both rooms. Great attitude, and great service."
5,"Very satisfied with this company and their services. From the first consultation all the way down to the last day of business, there was a sense of urgency and attention to my needs as the customer. My kitchen had lots of work to be done so I was honestly surprised all deadlines were met. All my requests were met, even the paint in the downstairs bathroom came out exactly as I had envisioned. I would recommend this companies services to anyone who wants a Grade A job done to turn their house into a home. :)"
5,"i Shopped around for a couple of companies, asked around to friends and I still was not sure. I was able to read about the company and had heard from a friend who had recently used their services to do the entrance of their home. After the initial contact I knew this was the right choice. The representative sent to my house was on time, friendly and seemed to be interested in the overall look I was going for. Even though I wanted a much more intricate look they were able to bring my idea to a reality and within the budget in a timely matter. And most of all it was done according to HOA regulations. I would seriously like to recommend them to my friends who need any jobs around the house."
5,"highly recommend this company, I am so pleased with the work that Mike has done. My kitchen looks brand new! Was very respectful of my ideas as well. Might have them do some more work for my home in the future."
5,"I could not be more pleased with the professionalism they have shown me. The 2 bathrooms at my house needed some remodeling. The sight of the floor, the sink, and the tub looked so outdated. They did an amazing job in transforming it. I couldn't be more happy to use my bathroom. My son was surprised when he saw his bathroom. They remodeled his tub as well as the flooring. He is excited to finally take a bubble bath in it. Their pricing is very fair, the material they have is excellent, and I loved how they take the time to listen to what you want (especially if you are detail orientated like me). This company has been so helpful that I will definitely refer them to friends and family."
5,The estimate I was given was fair. I received three other estimates and I feel I was given a fair quote for the work I wanted.
5,"I contracted with Baron Construction a about 3 months ago, I wanted to wait on writing review to make sure that the work was completed and in properly working condition. 

From the very first initial call, all the way through the completion of my kitchen and bathroom remodel my experience was amazing! My husband and I had just purchased our first home (which needed major upgrades) and we were a bit scared for lack of better words that someone would see that we are a young couple and would take advantage of us... a friend referred us to Baron Construction and  Mike was great! He sat with us and listened to what we wanted and all of the ideas we had and made those ides come to life. He even added an island! which I though wouldn't be possible.  He worked with us every step of the way.  Our kitchen and bathrooms are beautiful!!! 

We did end up going above our initial budget since his work is a bit pricey, but in the end it was well worth it! it's true what they say... you get what you paid for. And we LOVE the end result. The quality of his work speaks for itself. Our house finally became a home and we couldn't be more pleased. Thanks guys! 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
5,"My home needed a real make over. Specially my patio and fireplace. I'm very picky on who I will have working in my home. We had different vendors come out and give us estimates. Baron Construction and Remodeling CO gave us that feeling that everything was going to be taken care of the way we wanted our home to look like. From providing an estimate, clear explanation on how things were going to be done from beginning to end and last but not least great customer service. We were given the option to choose a date on when was more convenient to us, for them to come work in our home, of course within a range of dates they had available. From the moment they arrived at our home until the moment we came back. Everything was very well organized and on point. Phenomenal structure and workflow. With that being said I couldn't have chosen a better company to come and remodel our home. Extremely satisfied with the remodeling. Phenomenal work Baron Construction and Remodeling Co. Most definitely will recommend and will keep you for future remodeling in our home"
5,"My patio looks amazing! I mean, really! And we wouldn’t have been able to procure the perfect backyard without Baron. They were smart, helpful attentive and totally affordable. As soon as they were done I knew I had to write a review – a really, really good review. 

From start to finish Eli and crew were totally on our side. From planning to production, they considered what we wanted, and figured out a way to incorporate almost every single detail. The finished result looked exactly like the picture I had in my head – my dream backyard was finally a reality. 

I have to mention the price! Most companies I spoke to before hand wanted an arm and leg just to talk, but our guys at Baron quoted us appropriately AND our bill stayed the same from first quote to finished product – I couldn’t believe it! These guys are not only skilled but trustworthy too. 

In the end, we really loved working with them and would recommend to anyone looking for an equally positive experience with their remodel."
5,"Right away, I knew that this review would be a positive one - I have nothing but great things to say about the entire Baron construction crew. From day one, I felt fully informed with what needed to be done to retrofit our roof, and the lead on the project kept us in the loop through every minuscule detail, throughout the entire process. Not only am I completely satisfied with our newly secured roof, I HAVE to say that I felt completely secure having the team in and around my house unsupervised. PLUS they cleaned up after themselves every single day. How many construction companies can you say that about? On top of that, I got a fair price for the work they did, which stayed relatively the same throughout the entire process. No up sells or added costs for work they didn’t explain to me in detail. Overall we are more than happy with our choice – would definitely recommend Baron to anyone with retrofitting needs."
5,"We hired them to make some major repairs to the exterior of an older home we just bought. The repairs were related to dry rot and water damage to eaves and siding identified in the termite report.

They listened to what we wanted done and our priorities. They kept us informed as they progressed through the work and consulted us in a timely manner when needed. They worked consistently but did not rush. We were particularly concerned when we learned parts of our metal roof would have to be removed to do a proper repair. We had no need to be concerned however because they did a great job of replacing all the roofing tiles so you could not even tell they had been removed. We recently purchased this house and it is over 40 years old. We had no idea if they would find other damage when the siding was removed. They didn't and we really appreciated that they did not take advantage of us in that way.

The workers were professional, friendly and very skilled. Everything they did looks great and we were surprised at what a great job they did matching the old paint.  The siding repairs are not obvious and look fine with the rest of the siding that was untouched. They cleaned up thoroughly when they were done too."
5,"After our second child was born, I realized we needed to add another room to our home. The problem was that I wasn’t quite sure how we could do it because our was already cramped with small rooms. After a few recommendations, I called Baron Construction & Remodeling and told them the issue that I was having and they sent over a representative. We went through my home and he quickly noticed that the attic could be turned into another room with a small staircase added. It made perfect sense and the added stairs would not take up much room. 
So, after getting the estimate we set the appointment date and the work started on our new room. From the start I noticed the professionalism and work ethic from Baron Construction & Remodeling who seemed eager to take on the challenge of building our new room in the attic. During that time, they worked with us when we had to be gone so that everything would flow smoothly. To my surprise, the job was completed a bit ahead of time and I was lead through the entire room to make sure it was to my specifications. 
All in all, I was very pleased with Baron Construction & Remodeling as they did a great job of creating a new room out of our unused attic space. Now we have the extra room in our home needed all for a price that fit our budget. I cannot recommend the professionals at Baron Construction & Remodeling enough for their work."
5,"We reached out to several different vendors, but decided to go with Baron even though they weren't the cheapest.  We were naturally skeptical in having a relationship with any contractor, but our conversations with Mike and Eli regarding the finer points of the work estimate and the timeliness schedule of the work gave us the confidence we were looking for, so we pulled the trigger and went with Baron.  We made sure to be as flexible as we could be regarding timing, and I stayed in the house for the duration of the work.
The day before the work started, Eli called me to make sure I knew what to expect, as this was my first remodel of this scope.  Eli came out to the site, and we talked through where the majority of the work was going to take place, and what I could expect during and after the construction on each day.  I work from home, and was able to spend quite a bit of time being annoying and poking around the worksite, asking questions of the various crews that wereperforming work (foundation, framing, plumming, etc).  I'd talk with Eli every couple of days, and they were very flexible with my indecision, and periodic changes.  My wife went back and forth on what she wanted to do about a dozen times, and Eli had the patience of a saint, and made sure we got what we wanted.
Overall, the various crews were neat, punctual, and friendly, and the management was available and attentive, ! I was able to speak to someone when I needed to, and they were understanding in how stressful this process can be for a homeowner.  These guys were great! I highly recommend them!"
5,"My husband and I were referred to Baron by two different sources - the top pick from an online search by Home Advisor, and by my friend's parents. I was able to see my friend's parents recent kitchen remodel that was completed by Baron's project manager, Eli Levy, and his crew from Baron Construction. We own a 68 year old home and planned to remove a load bearing wall which separated our kitchen and living room in order to have an ""open concept"" living space. We also had our one and only main bathroom of the house completely remodeled by Baron as well. 

We met with Eli shortly after we signed all of the paperwork to begin the job in order to select the products that we wanted in our kitchen and bathroom at the warehouse and showroom. Eli's expertise and eye for design really helped in the process of shopping for our dream kitchen. The estimated timeline when we signed on to complete the job from start to finish was about 8 weeks.We worked with Baron and the structural engineer, and they were able to completely hide the massive load-bearing beam into the ceiling so the look of the kitchen and living space is seamless and beautiful. 

Of course, with all construction projects, it is crucial to constantly check on the contractors' work and job progress. My husband and I went to check on the house on a daily basis and always communicated with Eli on any issues that we had. We hired a moving company and completely moved out of our 3-bedroom home so that construction could be completed by Baron. Every room in the house was touched, so it was crucial for us as homeowners with a young infant child to be away from the construction zone.  Eli was always very professional and accommodating to work with, as were all of the contractors that came to complete the job. The contractors from Baron were extremely hard-working and friendly, and everything was communicated in the proper chain of command. 

Overall, the project timeline took about 4 months to complete. I am happy to say that we are now living in a beautiful ""almost brand new"" 68 year old home, and are very pleased with the layout and design of our new kitchen and bathroom. The experience of remodeling a home is definitely stressful and sometimes was not fun, but the end result is night and day! Baron does good quality work, but it is always important to check on the progress of your project as the homeowner and as the customer."
5,"They are very professional & knowledgeable.. Their is some of the best work we have experienced in a long time. Issues are dealt with promptly, and customer satisfaction is clearly a priority. Highly recommended!"
5,"Baron Construction is a excellent company. We would definitely hire them again.
We had learned that there was a serious problem under the house while having electrical work done. The concrete foundations at the bottom of the pier pilings were disintegrating. 
We left voice messages with several different contractors and foundation companies that we researched online, but many did not call back. Even more did not keep appointments.
Eli Levy of Baron Construction was the exception. He made a timely appointment and arrived when scheduled. Although we had been doing research online regarding foundations, this was a fairly grey area to us. When Eli came and looked in detail under the house, he informed us the problem was bigger that we had at first thought. We only had piers on half on the house!
While talking over the work that must be done, and the age and condition of the house, we brought up the condition of the roof. Eli looked at the roof and saw the sagging areas that we pointed out. We talked about El Nino and stared talking about roof repairs. It turned out that the roof was in worse shape that it looked on the surface; in fact there was no plywood base and only 2 layers of failing shingles (one wood, the original ""roof deck"").
We negotiated an excellent price by being flexible with start and finish dates. We even ended up having Eli use one of his (excellent) crews to do major internal painting in the house!
All inspections were passed on the 1st visit with flying colors. If you need work on your house, big or small, new or old, we heartily recommend speaking to Eli Levy before signing contracts with anyone else."
5,"We first find Baron construction and remodeling on Angie's list they have highly recommended reviews. we had Mike come to our house to give us an estimate, after we reviewed 3 others, 20 minutes in to the meeting we knew that Baron Construction is the company to do our project.
Mike gave us amazing ideas as how we can enlarge our kitchen. he is the only contractor that listen to my needs for more storage space, and also the only one that came up with the solution for that at the first meeting. he also able to fit an island they gave me my dream kitchen. there price was higher then the others but its worth it.  when you meet them at the first time you will notice the difference and the professionalism. along the process i met all there crew members and it was amazing to see how they all taking pride of what they do.
The company spirit transfer to every one of the workers. they also helped us to find the wright budget for our project and make sure we are not over spending. there guys always came on time. we will use them in the near future for our bathroom remodeling project, we are recommending them to everyone and to all our friends."
5,"The Baron Construction and Remodeling demoed the entire kitchen, and remodeled all the counters and installed new cabinets. They also installed all the appliances. Ensured that the new kitchen meets all the new building codes. Baron Construction and Remodeling did a very professional job and taking our requests and suggestions into consideration. All the workers are polite and professional. The project leader, Eli Levy is very attentive and visited the job site frequently. The owner, Mike Baron also paid several visits personally. They also built a custom bench for our kitchen nook which turned out very nice.

For the downstairs bathroom, they also demoed the entire bathroom and built the shower from scratch. They did a great job on the tile for the shower. It is the most beautiful shower in the house now. 

I would recommend Baron Construction and Remodeling to my friends and other people."
5,Mike and Eli did an amazing job on our kitchen remodel and bathrooms. Very professional and took care of any issues that came up immediately.  They really support the client. The job was beautiful. No delays except in our part with our gorgeous back splash. I would highly recommend. My friends who have seen the kitchen comment on the fact that it's beautiful and looks like it should be in a designer magazine. You do get what you pay for and I would do it again!!!!
5,"I would highly recommend Baron Construction for your next project, and here's why.  We had a bedroom remodel and Josue and the Baron Construction team were very professional from Day 1.  When they came in to scope out the work, we were provided with an estimate at the same time - with an initial write up of the contract.  We also received documentation on their licenses, bond, and insurance - all on the first meeting.  Baron Construction was able to start our project a few days after we had signed the contract.  

Once the project started, the team was very conscious to cover the floors and other areas to make sure it wouldn't be impacted from the work.  They had estimated 2 weeks to complete the work and came within that timeframe.  Our bedroom remodel included replacement of ceiling (due to leak from bathroom above), check for additional leaks, texturize ceiling and paint, installation of recessed lighting, painting of walls and closet interior, replacement of carpet with new flooring, and new baseboards.

We were impressed with their commitment to the quality of their work and made sure we were happy along the way.  If you have home improvement projects in mind, I would recommend Baron Construction.  I know we'll definitely keep them in mind for our next project."
5,"First they came and give us an estimate that we really liked, we signed the contract to do the kitchen floors.
Before they started  the job I ask them to give me a price for the complete kitchen remodeling.
again we liked the price and we signed the contract (BTW they helped us with financing the job).
during the process we found out the electrical wiring needs to be replaced mike gave us very good price on that so we let them do it.
they also gave us 3D design rendering that was great, we actually could see how the kitchen will look like.. 
Roy Mike and the team where very helpful they answered all of our concerns and even when we change things around they where very understanding and helped us to make our dream come true.
we where very impressed when all city inspection pass at the first time.
we love how our kitchen came out, it looks amazing like it came out of a catalog, its like living in a mention. 
we will use Baron construction again to do our roof in the in the near future.
they did exactly what they promise and above.
we are extremely happy that we choose Baron construction and remodeling  to do our kitchen."
5,My kitchen remodel is so beautiful!  The project manager communicated effectively so were kept informed of timelines and next steps. Our designer listed to what we wanted and helped us create our dream kitchen! All of the contractors were very professional and treated my home respectively.
5,"I had an absolute blast doing my kitchen remodel with Beatris Gross. she was absolutely fantastic. Confident, professional, knowledgeable, and with a real eye for design choices, the kitchen looks even better than I would have hoped. she had a real knack for not only answering all of my questions, but taking what my wife and I wanted to do with our kitchen and making it part of the whole project. Absolutely I will be working with her again for any remodeling projects."
5,"Treeium and specifically Beatris Gross and her entire team are worth every penny. No matter the size of the project you can tell they all care about the details and doing things right the first time. I never had to wonder if this work was up to code. They are experts and artists in what they do and every single crew was respectful, skilled, and honest. We have found our contractor for every other project. We needed someone to guide us through the kitchen renovation process and we found that in Beatris. We love our new kitchen and can’t wait for future work!"
5,"Our home renovation couldn’t have been completed without the great work from Treeium. We added 400+ sq ft to our home, turning it from a 3 bed/2bath to 4 bed/2 bath, large open concept with new kitchen & dining room. Like any home reno, there were some unexpected items, but Sam & the team worked with us to prioritize what we wanted and needed. We love how everything turned out!! I highly recommend this team!"
1,"Treeium recently completed the remodel of a portion of my home and a detached garage to create two apartments (ADUs). Unfortunately, my experience was very negative and fraught with tension, disagreement, and arguments. Most importantly, the project was scheduled to be completed in 3.5 months but took over 7 months to complete, without a reasonable cause for the delay. Additionally, they repeatedly touted their years of experience and expertise, which caused me great concern when I discovered that their contract’s payment schedule forced me to pay large sums of money for work that had not been completed. On a positive note, their sales pitch and marketing are exceptional."
5,"We used Treeium for a complete new kitchen and bathroom. From the  start to the finish, we were guided along each step of the way by Beatris, the wonderful project manager, who worked on it! She was there to assist us with every single decision that we had to make! She gave us details about each product and offered excellent suggestions, and then allowed us to make the final decision. She is very knowledgeable about everything that her job entails and extremely precise with even the small details, thus assuring that the end results will be exceptional!! We loved her for that! Over the duration of the project, she also showed kindness and consideration in that she willingly made adjustments to do things at a later time of the day to suit our schedule,  and even assisted us in getting a driving cart in the stores when necessary, due to health issues! Overall, we think that Beatris went ‘above and beyond’ the requirements of her job, and we are absolutely pleased with the job done! We would definitely recommend Treeium and Beatris to everyone!!! We are so delighted to have a beautiful new kitchen and bathroom!"
5,"Treeium is awesome! Seriously, the most incredible discovery I've made. We had a complex project (2 walls, a bi-fold door, and glass) and Treeium handled it flawlessly. Several other larger companies that I contacted stated that they would be unable to come in for another week, implying that someone would be sleeping in the living room, and that their charges were significantly higher without tax. Treeium was cost effective, well-organized, and extremely efficient. Sebastian phoned back to confirm and even offered to come earlier in the day on Saturday, recognizing that work into the afternoon/evening would cause complications in our building. Sebastian and his team performed miracles in a matter of hours, and the wall beyond our expectations. We were blown away by their professionalism and friendliness, especially on such a frantic move-in day.

After the wall was done, we intended to add plexiglass to the top but were unable to do so due to a lack of materials. Sebastian contacted the next day to set a time for early Monday morning to come finish the repair and allow me to continue working later in the day. He did a wonderful job, and it gives even more privacy while maintaining the room's natural light.

Sebastian and the entire team at Treeium did an excellent job! Thank you guys!"
5,"We've had an amazing experience with Treeium. In and out in a flash with a flawless product. We've utilized them on numerous occasions for large-scale projects and they've always started and finished on schedule. After the workers departed one of the projects, I identified a minor issue that needed to be addressed. I contacted Sebastian and he answered instantly and arrived the next day to resolve the issue without charging me further fees. Impeccable service and overall great quality products."
4,Eran was friendly and professional from the beginning.  I loved the 3D design at the beginning.  It allowed us to be more specific in the material selections.  It was really a great experience working with Eran and Treeium.  And the bathroom looked even more beautiful than we imagined. I highly recommend them both for any future remodels.
5,"Treeium did everything that they promised to do and did it in less time than originally estimated.  Our Project Manager AmirTeymouri was nothing short of amazing.  He stopped by the project every day just to check in and make sure we didn't have any questions.  Not only that but he always answered my calls or texts within a few minutes...even on Saturday or after hours.  

I have heard (and had) horror stories about contractors but not the case with Treeium. I can assure you that Amir will be our only call when we are ready for the next project."
5,"There was a leak from the shower pipes that went unnoticed for months. When discovered, the damage was too extensive so we decided to bite the bullet and remodel. Treeium outperformed my expectations with the bathroom remodeling project. I had the pleasure to work with Beatris Gross, who exemplifies the meaning of customer service and delivers on her commitments. She was attentive to all of my inquiries, responding immediately. I was 400 miles away during the remodel and she kept me apprised at every single step through phone calls, texts and pictures. I appreciated her remodeling expertise and eye for detail. The workers on the remodel are masters of their crafts, not jacks of all trades. This gives me the assurance the work was done correctly. No more leaks! The project was finished within the time frame stated and I am very pleased with the result. I highly recommend Beatris.  And I would definitely work with her again."
5,"they were wonder to work with. I would recommend them without hesitation. They were professional, pleasant, and responsive. ok ok"
5,"Farid and his team from Treeium did an excellent job remodeling our bathroom. The end result was better than we imagined. Farid was responsive, completed the job on time and there weren’t any surprises in cost. We will use Farid Ghaheri and his team when we are ready to remodel our kitchen."
1,"SPENT $$$ - GOT NOWHERE!!!!  I had an awful experience with this company.  They were paid for their professional expertise to assess whether a simple balcony could be built.  Upon their assurance that it could be, I engaged upon the next phase of the project.  After several months and additional payment, they informed me that it could not be done.  Rather than taking responsibility for their error and refunding the second payment, they decided to double down and charge me more!!  UNETHICAL, UNREASONABLE, UNRELIABLE."
5,"We had a storage room off the garage converted to a studio apartment. The project managers Dorel Zander and Lior Lazrovich, their  architect, designers, and work crews were friendly and excellent at what they do.  Even with the issues that the City raised about the property and physical challenges,  they were willing to work with us, within our budget, to get the job completed within the time frame we were working with.  Dorel and Lior stayed in constant contact with us throughout the project, particularly with the stages of the remodel and the city inspections. They were always very responsive to any questions or concerns we had and addressed them fully.   The bathroom and kitchenette look terrific.  Very pleased with the overall experience."
5,The company with Avram and Eran Dukeman were very helpful in guiding us through the entire project remodeling our entire kitchen and 2 bathrooms. They were always clear about choices to be made and when changes were necessary. They also tended to spot problems before we noticed them. Good guidance all through the entire project.
2,"I would steer clear of this company.  They started my kitchen remodel August 3 and it is October 29 and it is not yet complete.  There have been 28 working days that there were no workers at the house.  The foreman never comes around nor does the project manager.    Several times the inspector came to the house and no one from Treeium was there to meet them.  I asked for my concerns to be escalated and was told management were all busy.  The communication from the project manager to the workers is horrible.  The cabinet guys had no idea we were to have toe-kick drawers or certain pull-outs.  I asked one of the workers, who is giving you direction and they indicated the direction was coming from me. I call the phone number and there is an option to select 3 to discuss concerns with a project, but when you select 3 you receive an error message and it disconnects you. The only saving grace is that the kitchen looks really nice and I am pleased with it but the process to get there was horrible!"
5,"Treeium remodeled two of our bathrooms and we couldn't be more pleased with the result. Everything was completed professionally, on time and within our budget. Dorel Zender is excellent as a project manager. He is client focused, very professional and has an excellent demeanor for working with people anxious about having work done on their home. 

We are currently using Treeium to convert a window in one of our bedrooms into a sliding glass door along with adding a deck to allow us better access to our yard. Everything has been going well.

I definitely recommend Treeium and you would be fortunate to have Dorel as your project manager."
5,"Our home was in desperate need of a remodel, it needed everything, new roof, flooring, re wire,  re plumb, four bathrooms, game room and a kitchen. Basically our home was a gut job.  I had been dreaming of a remodel for years. Needless to say we were nervous about hiring a company that could handle such a big project. After talking to numerous contractors I was becoming discouraged, no real quotes and no time lines.  Then I discovered Treeium and knew I had found a company that I could trust with a 1/2 million Dollar renovation.
Shahar Algazy has been nothing short of amazing, treating our home like his own and diligently keeping everything on time and on budget, if not Below.  Everyday since we began Shahar has had a 10 man crew on the job, practically unheard  of with most companies. When it came time to upgrade the electric panel we were faced with the possible need to destroy a large portion of  our yard and cut down a  beautiful and stately tree that is a major feature in our yard. Shahar could have left it at that but he went the extra  mile to find a better solution. Shahar saved us 30K and our beloved ficus tree.
We continue to be impressed with Treeium's customer service and communication. The Treeium portal is very easy to navigate and keeps everything clear and organized. We love the gallery that lets our friends and family keep track of the  progress. Great work Treeium and Shahar Algazy for talking such good care of our home."
5,"My wife and I were looking to completely open up our kitchen and bring into a modern aesthetic. As you can see in the pictures, we had a very cramped galley style kitchen with 80s style red oak and old appliances.  

Our project managers, Lior Lazarovich and Dorel Zander, were very easy to work with and understood what we were looking for and made sure to incorporate our needs throughout the design. They were able to remove two major walls to open up the kitchen, and their designer Natali did an amazing job of reconfiguring the cabinets to give us an ample amount of storage.

Overall, I'd highly recommend working with Treeium, and specifically with Lior and Dorel.  They were very professional, always attentive to our numerous texts and concerns even on the weekends (we were those annoying clients lol). They handled everything with an easy going nature that was straightforward and honest. We look forward to working with them again on any projects we have in the future! Thanks guys"
5,"Having never done such a major project, I was more than a little apprehensive about the timeline, but my project manager Beatris Gross made sure everything kept moving.  It took just one month from start to finish.  Everyone who worked on my kitchen was knowledgeable and professional.  Beatris spent hours helping me choose just the right materials to complete my vision for a new kitchen.  I would definitely recommend this company."
5,"Three months ago we finished our project with Treeium, successfully.
Farid & Gabriel played a fundamental role during the entire process, which included dealing with architects, engineers, city codes and builders. They both were very accommodating, patient and extremely professional.  
Our project was a major home remodel (90%). It took less than five months from the moment the plans were approved to completion.
We hired Treeium to ensure our home was built structurally safe & sound, and that’s what they delivered. Have already recommended them to several people."
5,"We recently remodeled our master bathroom.  We gutted the entire space and put in both a half bath and a full master.  We could not have been more pleased with Treeium, the contractor we worked with on this project.  We recommend them highly, and plan to have them return to do our kitchen!  Contract Treeium for all your remodeling needs.  855.833.8733 and ask for Dorel or Lior."
5,"My wife and I are retired and decided to invest in our home of 35 years in Irvine by upgrading all three bathrooms. We had remodeled them only once before and did not have much money at the time and we were determined to get it right this time.

We decided against hiring an interior designer so we interviewed contractors that were larger firms with good resources like a Project Manager that would come onsite weekly and see the project thru from beginning to end. We knew we would pay a little more for that level of service. We decided on Treeium after meeting a few times with our Project Manager Amir Teymouri.

Amir made us really comfortable with the depth of his remodel knowledge, gave us very credible  design idea’s  and excelled at both his verbal and written communications. That combined with Treeium’s size ($100M in annual sales), discounts with major suppliers of bath fixtures  and tile Were ket you decision along with the excellent ratings on Yelp, Houzz etc. So, we signed a contract for all 3 bathrooms with Amir.

Amir did exactly as he said he would by monitoring his crews work, visiting our home several times a week to check on progress, ask us about how we liked the work and communicating to us clearly as to schedule and what materials or decisions were needed (and when) from us.

Amir has terrific contacts with key suppliers like bathroom fixtures, tile stores, shower enclosures etc…. and those relationships really helped when issues would present themselves. For example, our supplier for the master bath sold us the wrong rough-in valve (which was already installed and tiled over) for the filler tube for our soaker tub. Amir handled all the conversations with the supplier and presented us with 3 different alternative replacements for the tube filler that would fit the already installed rough-in valve.
 Treeium is a very good company but as always its the people that make the difference. In my opinion Amir is a very good Project Manager and has a very good team supporting him. I would highly recommend Treeium and especially Amir Teymouri for your home remodel needs.

Bottom line, could not be happier with the final competition of all 3 bathrooms!  I was so satisfied mid-way with through the project I signed another contract to have Treeium paint the exterior of my house and they did a terrific job on that as well."
5,"Treeium is not necessarily the most cost efficient company I’d you shop around, but you certainly get what you pay for with contractors. As a company, it was very professional, the portal is great, you have licensed contractors that are insured at all times. Our process was timely, transparent and on budget which is all we can ask for. 
My review is actually in support of our project manager/contractor Amir. He went above and beyond for our project before, during and after construction. He was available for questions at all hours, gave honest feedback and worked with us to find great solutions. Our kitchen resurfacing was painless and Amir made sure it was finished to perfection down to the last detail. 

We have recommended Amir (and therefore Treeium) to several colleagues and friends and would certainly recommend him and the Treeium team to anyone looking for painless remodeling."
5,"Lior Lazarovich is an outstanding project manager. He has really looked out for me throughout the re-modal process. His daily communication was indispensable. I looked forward to the texts, they kept me apprised every step of the way. Lior Lazarovich, built trust with his strong communication and  his attention to detail. He made me feel relaxed through the process and I am very happy and excited by the results. My kitchen is everything I could have asked for.

If I ever do another re-modal I would just call Lior."
5,"We recently had a four season sunroom addition built at our house. Our project was managed by Medhi Heshmati and Amir Teymouri, and we couldn't have asked for more professional and communicative project managers. From the start, they were with us, helping us plan out our sunroom to our budget, and explaining all the steps and processes involved. They let us know the approximate timeline for start of construction, and what would be involved, and provided suggestions on best practices that would result in a highest end quality for our budget. The build team was professional and always courteous, and were very receptive and responsive to any questions and issues we had. From start to finish, the project was streamlined, and on target, and we are very satisfied with the end result. I will definitely be calling up Mehdi and Amir for future remodels, and would not hesitate to recommend them to friends and family."
5,"Thanks to Lior Lazarovich, Dorel Zander and the Treeium team for the transformation of my parents home! The timeline and communication throughout the remodel process was great! Especially with my busy schedule. All the work was very efficient and thorough. Very satisfied! Would recommend to anyone looking to remodel."
5,"Last November, I started calling around to get some quotes for remodeling my master bathroom.  I'd set a budget and wanted to plan ahead to keep the project on track.  I'd calculated that the best time for the work to begin would be February/March 2020.   Some of the contractors I called turned me down because the work wouldn't be starting immediately.  But when I called Treeium, the response couldn't have been more different.   

Right from our first meeting, project managers Shahar ""Shawn"" Algazy and Guy Borenstein listened to my wish-list, got a sense of my aesthetic, and started making suggestions to realize my vision.  Their advice about materials and 3D rendering of the design were especially reassuring for someone undertaking a remodel on this scale for the first time.

The whole process has unfolded so smoothly.   I've been kept in the loop every step of the way.   Shahar in particular has stopped by regularly to make sure everything has been going to plan.  The crew has been consistently on time, amazingly friendly and polite and very considerate in cleaning up at the end of each day.    The team effort and spirit at Treeium is truly outstanding -- everyone I've talked with has contributed to realizing this vision.  Shahar and Guy are truly amazing!  I'm extremely grateful and very happy to be part of the Treeium family.   Thoroughly recommended!"
5,"Medhi was great to work with. He answered all my questions and provided a detailed scope of work on the bid. Adjusted it multiple times to meet my needs before even signing a contract. His foreman and crew were efficient and courteous. They completed the job on ahead of schedule and passed all inspections with ease. the remodel of our bathroom was amazing, I would recommend them to anybody."
5,"A few months after our massive job was completed (new electrical, new walls, new floors, new doors, new HVAC, etc) we noticed that a couple of our barn doors were starting to stick a bit. When we reached out to Gina at Treeium, she had a crew out to us the next business day to take care of it, free of charge.

The crew was in and out and took care of the two doors without any fuss. We really appreciated that Treeium came out so quickly (and for free) in order to make sure we were fully satisfied with their work."
5,"Treeium is great to work with. Professional, knowledgeable and an overall great experience. Guy, Shahar, Eli and Maya are my team.  They have earned my trust as we are halfway through my complete remodel and addition.  I can sleep better knowing my home is in their hands."
5,"I worked with Eli at Treeium over 3 1/2 months - remodeling two bathrooms. From our first conversation to the last, Eli was a pleasure to work with and Treeium did not disappoint! Our remodeling was (IMHO) pretty extensive -- new sinks, new vanities, new toilets, new lighting, new stall shower, new floors, new tile, and so on. The only thing we didn't replace was the bathtub - because Eli recognized that it could be refinished and look like new (which it did!!). We also did some structural work (reconfiguring a closet and also changing a doorway). I had a million decisions to make in the process of selecting materials, tile, flooring, countertops, etc. -- and so I was in steady contact with Eli to make sure what I was picking out would meet code requirements and would work within the constraints of our bathrooms (e.g., making sure the stall shower wasn't too large for the space). He was always fast in responding, patient in answering my questions, and helpful in providing the necessary information. Treeium's team was also great -- from the folks who handled the loan, to the foreman of the job, to the workers who did the actual work. Everyone was friendly, competent, FAST, and professional. On many days, I was out of town and I had no hesitation leaving them a key in a lock box and letting them work without my actually being there. If they ran into a problem or a question, they contact me -- so I never had to worry that they would make a decision in my absence that I wouldn't agree with. Eli said the first bathroom would take 3 weeks and the second (master) bathroom would take 4 weeks. And he was true to his word! Even allowing for ""wasted"" days due to holidays or waiting for city inspections, the projects were complete in 7 weeks. I would definitely work with Treeium again and with Eli, in particular!"
5,"We just had two bathrooms remodeled by Treeium.  Lior, the project manager, made sure that all was on schedule -- the crews, the suppliers and us.  We are very happy with the new bathrooms in our home.

 

The contract said the job would be done in 7-8 weeks; it was done in 5 weeks.  Lior is a “taskmaster” in the best sense of the word.  He is also a cheerleader.  He kept us all “in line” by reminding us of our responsibilities. He was at the site every day.  His crew was friendly, conscientious, and efficient.

 

We live approximately seven hours drive from the construction site and had several trips planned during the reconstruction.  Prior to starting the project, we were supplied detailed schematics as well as a designer’s full color rendering of what the bathrooms would look like on completion.  As a result, we were able to follow the work via skype or photos which Lior supplied daily.  We made minor changes along the way.  Lior was always positive and gave great advice in relation to costs etc..  We were told exactly how much the project (or changes we made) would cost there were no surprises when the work was completed.   

 

We are more than happy with the work done by Treeium.  We plan to keep on using Treeium for the rest of our renovations because of the fine work done by the crews and the direction of Lior, the project manager."
5,"This was my first remodel.  I was very fortunate to find Amir of Treeium to do my master bathroom renovation.

From the very first meeting with Amir I knew this was the right fit.  He was told me about the company, showed me various jobs he was in charge of as the project manager.  He walked me through the process and made me feel confident that Treeium and Amir were right for the job.

The remodel went like clockwork and was completed ON TIME!! Amir was at the job site almost daily and was always available by text or phone, including weekends and holidays! When in doubt I relied upon his expertise and he never steered my wrong. Amir kept me informed throughout the process. He always told me at the close of work what the next day would be. I appreciated his attention to detail and his honesty.  I always felt I was in good hands.

Not only is Amir wonderful but so are his team.  They were very polite, cordial and without too much interference with my day.  They cleaned up daily and the dust was minimal due to the plastic tarp taped to adjoining rooms. I have a small dog and they were always careful to keep the front door closed so she would not escape.  

After hearing all the horror stories from others about a remodel I feel very lucky to have found Amir. He made the remodel flow easily and flawlessly. If I need any renovations in the future I will call Amir."
5,We hired Treeium to do our second story bedroom and bathroom addition. It was a big job for us and took almost 6 months. Beatris Gross was our project manager and we were so grateful for her! She ensured the work be done right and to our liking on everything. She always responded to our phone calls and texts immediately. We have small children and she was very careful to ensure the home was safe the whole time. Beatris has great taste and helped us pick beautiful finishes for our room. I highly recommend asking for her when you do your job. She was a joy to work with!
5,"Guy has been very good, very thrall with great project management and communication. He is always checking on the project and the progress, my wife Merrillyn and I have been very pleased with Guy Breuer. He is an excellent project manager. Thank you for the great experience."
5,"The company was very professional
And I trusted them above the other five that came out to give me an estimate and they were competitive"
5,"We are just finishing up a bathroom remodel with Treeium.  Etel Littman was our project manager and from the very first meeting Etel was just fantastic.  She listened to our fuzzy ideas and asked great clarifying questions to focus on what we really wanted.  This is our first remodel experience and she made it wonderful and easy.  She really walked us through the process the whole way and helped us protect ourselves from less honest contractors.  Our final inspection is tomorrow and the bathroom is just perfect.  The work quality was fabulous and the team of workers were always polite, conscientious, and hard working.  It was such a great process that I recommended Etel and Treeium to my mother who also wants to remodel her bathroom. I trust Etel to do a great job and to live up to my mother’s demands.  If you are looking to remodel your home, Treeium is just a great company."
5,"Guy Breuer is an awesome project manager for Treeium!  He is very knowledgeable, friendly, and attends to my questions in a timely manner.  He checks in frequently with me, both by phone and email, to keep me apprised of my bathroom remodel's progress.  Treeium has been a great choice for me and I highly recommend Treeium to anyone needing remodeling done!"
5,"The whole Treeium team was terrific.  Guy Breuer was the project manager.  Big kudos....on time, within scope and on budget.  Can't ask for more, except for the finished product which has had nothing but rave reviews from everyone who's seen the kitchen."
5,"Forbes magazine was right, that is all I got to say ! If you are looking to make your home more efficient , to lower your costs overall from your home, this is where you will make the final decision. Treeium was referred to me by neighbor, in Sherman Oaks, we really help each other out, to make sure our community and our homes look and live on it's best. My home was over 70 Years old, and only thing I did was change attic insulation once, no difference, Treeium came , showed me suggestions, and I ended up going with an self efficient smart home,  my living Costs from my home have dropped a drastic 35 percent in costs, I didnt think this was possible, but they made it possible, on top of that,  they went ahead and planted a tree for remodeling my home to an efficient environment friendly home,they really do care about the environment just like it mentioned in the article, I must say they deserve 10 stars not 5, thank you once again for educating me and helping my family live a better and more earth friendly life."
5,"We worked with Shahar Algazy and Maya Orlova on our kitchen, bath and wet bar remodel.  Treeium is proactive, on time, within budget and provides high quality work. Having a large team and industry network enabled them to keep the project moving forward."
5,"Treeium is an excellent company that I have been working with, but the individual that should be recognized by everyone is Etel Littman because of her fantastic customer service that continues to drive Treeium to success. I am thankful for Etel’s high quality customer service she never lets me down or anyone that I know. An example of her excellent service was her knowledge in design and ability to work efficiently with me in providing best pricing and quality material to all customers on time."
5,"We are working with Etel from Treeium. She has been a great project manager for us thus far. She has been very approachable, available, and has helped guide us in our ongoing kitchen remodel."
5,"My husband and I got bids from 7 contractors and decided to move forward with our kitchen remodel with Treeium. A few of the quotes came in at similar prices so what won us over was our project manager, Etel Littman. From the first meeting until now, communication has been clear and straightforward. She was one of the only people to educate us on how to do our homework on a contractor - together we went onto the CSLB website to compare all the companies and overall we liked what Treeium has to offer. Through the process of picking our materials, Etel has also been very flexible and accommodating, meeting us at tile stores, trying to find us the best pricing, and even dropping off samples to our home on a Sunday. Demo starts soon and I'm looking forward to the kitchen of our dreams! I feel our kitchen will be in good hands with this company and project manager."
5,"I used Guy Borenstein from Treeium for a huge project last year, I had my entire kitchen and living room remodeled and upgraded. I was extremely happy with the quality of their work and the caliber of all the workmen that Guy Borenstein has on his team.  Their work exceeded all my expectations! 
I am in the process of remodeling my back yard and bbq area and Guy Borenstein is back to the drawing board!  There is no other contractor I will work with.
Can't wait to see the end result!"
5,"The 60-year old sink in our rental property required serious work. Because they seemed to be the most sincere about fixing our problem, we hired Treeium, Inc. in Valley Village to do the work. Guy Borenstein was the Project Manager and Elizabeth Camarena was the site supervisor. Like most projects, we anticipated a certain level of anxiety until the job was complete but Guy and Elizabeth made this project virtually stress-free for us. The finished work is beautiful and, when we do further upgrades, we will consider Treeium as our first choice."
5,Treeium is an excellent company and Guy Borenstein is an amazing contractor. The company truly cares about their clients and tries their best to be respectful and accommodating during what can be a very difficult time. I have done many projects with Treeium and Guy Borenstein and I look forward to building the ADU that is our next project. I know it will be done with excellent quality given the multiple projects I have already done with Guy and Treeium!
5,"Being our first remodel, my husband and I were a bit anxious about the whole process. From the beginning, the project manager with Treeium, Etel Littman, was great! She was very informative and thoroughly explained what to expect.  Also, she provided great ideas, from the materials, colors and design. Etel was super attentive to details and she has been a pleasure to work with. We look forward to our new home!"
5,"I’ve worked with Treeium on three different projects including two bath remodels and the best thing about them is their desire to accommodate the needs and requests of the customer. They also have great post project support.  In the last project, the project managers Farid Ghaheri and Amir Teimouri were accommodating, flexible and patient. In addition, Jose Castillo who did all the work was very patient and professional. Jose does high quality work and has great attention to detail.  Treeium is a good choice because of their customer service and post project support."
5,Treeium was professional and really cared about our satisfaction through the entire process. From my initial contact they were very responsive. I started contacting different places to learn about bathroom and kitchen remodeling and decided to give Treeium a call. I was super pleased with my initial phone consultation and decided to schedule to have a field estimator out to see the projects and provide a bid. The estimator was very friendly and had a ton of knowledge in the processes and different bathroom and kitchen upgrades available. After meeting with a couple of establishments it was clear to us that Treeium was the company for our projects. The crew and project manager were absolute professionals. We are 100% satisfied and recommend Treeium to our family and friends. Thank you!
5,"I have a small project with Treeium. My project manager is Shahar Algazy. They really give me a good help to finish my project. I owned an apartment since August 2018. I hired a contractor right after I own the place, but they took my deposit and did not do anything for 6 months, which made me into a really bad situation. Then I found Treeium on Yelp. Lucky, they went in the next day after I contact them and give me a big help. My HOA is so hard to communicate. It took us a month to start the project. Shahar even went to my HOA meeting to explain how our project going to do (I have never heard that any contractor will come to the meet, especially for a small project.) Finally, we got the approval letter and start the project. Since then everything goes very smooth. Shahar come almost everyday to see how the work is going. I must mention Roy and his buddy. They do everything perfectly, even surprise the inspector. They use all good and expensive things to make sure everything they did is in a perfect shape. Then the patching guys and painting guys came in after. To be honors the patching guys and painting guys are just alright (nothing bad, I think I just spoiled). However, they still help me a lot on those small projects which belong to myself and not on the contract for free. After a month working. My apartment finally turns into what I was looking for. Shahar is a nice project manager. As a contractor he gave me a lot of suggestions from the customer side, which I believe he can make bigger money without those suggestion. To be the truth, Shahar becomes my friend instead of just a project manager. If you are looking for a contractor. Talk to Treeium and ask Shahar as your project manager. You won’t find any project manager who will pick up your phone almost 24/7 and tell you what the best option is and what the cheapest option is to achieve your goal. Also, if possible, ask Shahar to bring Roy and his buddy in, which will make sure your electric has no problem and shock the inspector because of the nice job. 
As a review, I should let them know that their painters need to improve they job. Nice people as well but can be better. Especially after I have Shahar and Roy, I feel they should be better to be called Treeium.
Thank you Treeium to help me finish my project and give me a lot of help on the small things that I planned to do myself in order to save money."
5,"Treeium is an outstanding company and I loved working with my project manager, Guy.  I live in NY and was doing a bathroom remodel in my San Diego condo long distance.  Guy's communication was excellent and he handled everything for me.  The workmanship was terrific - the bathroom is stunning.  And my sister who lives there said his crew was very polite, very neat, and very punctual.   I highly recommend Treeium, and would use them again in a heartbeat!"
5,"Treeium is an excellent, extremely professional company. They worked fast and efficiently, and created a beautiful new bathroom for us. The quality of the work is outstanding and the entire team of specialists  work together to do an outstanding job. We have now hired them to remodel our kitchen, a second bathroom, as well as other rooms in our home. We would like to thank our contractor Lior Lazarovich and his entire team for a job super well done! Thank you!"
5,"Awesome guy  and  Professional Individual. 
I wasn't aware about Knowledge and skills. Very confident in many areas and topics.  Easy and direct conversation within professional manner."
5,"Treeium has just completed our down-to-the-studs remodel of a 1977 guest bathroom.  Our initial contact was with Tomer Turjeman.  He was pleasant and informative on the telephone, arrived promptly and answered all our questions.  We then left town for two months.  When we recontacted Tomer, he arrived a couple days later and spent several hours helping us clarify how we wanted the remodeled bathroom to look.  He offered suggestions, gently guided us away from a few bad decisions, and offered resources.

Work began within the week.  We opted to select materials ourselves and were very pleased with the suppliers Tomer recommended.  He told us that if we had the materials on hand as needed (we managed to do so), it would take no more than 6 weeks, and that he would try for 4 weeks.  It actually took 18 days from start to finish. 

Each evening, Tomer texted us the plan for the next day.  Three Treeium crews did the work.  All of them arrived when stated, were careful of our possessions, were tidy as the day progressed, and cleaned up at the end of each day, which was generally mid-afternoon.  All 8 guys were pleasant, skillful, and efficient.

This was a relatively small project, but Tomer made us feel that we were his best & most important customer.  We are very pleased with the quality of the work and with our relationship with Tomer.

We found this a very positive experience and have couple more projects in mind with them."
5,"I recently had some major work done with Treeium and it came out great. We had very expensive sliding doors added to the back of our house after another contractor did a poor job. Then the recent rains caused some balcony damage. Gina and Greg were on the case a had a team resolve the problem for us. My home is in excess of $5,000,000 and I felt comfortable using Treeium."
5,"I'd like to thank the good people at Treeium, especially Gina and Greg and all the people at the Quality Assistance Department that help me out with my leaky roof. I had treeium come out two years ago to replace my whole roof, 2 years later we had a leak, even though we're out of warranty for the labor they came out and patch the roof for no charge. Gina was kind and courteous to help me with my problem, and stayed in contact with me till the issue was resolved. And Greg did everything he could to make things right. And stayed on top of things till the leak was fixed. I would recommend Treeium to anyone who needs any general construction done."
5,Amir Teymouri of Treeium is very professional and hard working.  He is doing a great job.  The work looks great.  Very efficient.
5,"I have had experience with one other ""5"" star company and all I can say is not all 5 star companies are the same on Home Advisor. Treeium is a true 5 star company-a class act, a family-like company. First it started with Liran who wrote in detail exactly what we would expect in remodeling our 1970's kitchen. As with some companies, we were not pressured. Next came Natalie, a first class interior designer who did a computer model of our new kitchen in detail. She brought samples of cabinet finishes, back splashes and paint to go with the countertops we had discussed with Liran. During demolition the crew discovered the outside kitchen wall was soaking wet. The wall board and insulation was removed and Liran was called. When our new shower was turned on, the water was running down the wall from a broken drain pipe that had been caused by another ""5"" star company when they replaced the upstairs shower and plumbing a few weeks before. I can't imagine what the damage would have been if we had waited the 3 years to remodel the kitchen as originally planned. Liran came right over to assess the situation and got the repairs done ASAP. The rest of the remodeling came together with no problems and the end result was exactly what we wanted. Unlike the other company who left as soon as the inspector signed the report, Treeium paid attention to the finishing details. All I had to do was text Liran with what I wanted done and it was taken care of; to fixing spots on the ceiling to moving a drawer in one of the cabinets, even the tiniest finishing details were taken care of. I would not hesitate to recommend Treeium and make our kitchen available for viewing by potential customers."
5,"I would like to express our gratitude of selecting Treeium as our contractor for our major remodel to our home in Laguna Beach, Ca.But, more than this, we were fortunate to have Farid Ghaheri as our general contractor. Farid's professionism, attention to details, knowledge of construction/local laws/vendors, communicating and just plain getting the job done, was superb.  Amir was excellent as well. Always available to us. 
Our Remodel was done in 3 months ! Right on Time.
We have recommend Treeium and Farid to any of the other villa owners who are planning on doing any type of remodel. And have communicated to our General Manager, to add Treeium to our community preferred contractor list. Thank You again
Steve & Diane"
5,"We've been working with Ilya Nodel and he is a gem!  We are doing an addition to our home and he is professional and friendly.  He has been patient and also reassuring during the planning stages.  He is always available to answer any questions we might have.  Everything he has told us has been accurate, we couldn't ask for better communication."
5,I hired Treeium to come out and do a bath remodel.  I ended up having them do all the flooring as well.  Guy Breuer was the Project Manager.  I liked that he always responded to my texts and questions promptly.  He met with my schedule.  Was friendly and cooperative with my needs.
5,"We are so pleased with our addition progress of a first floor master. Treeium and Guy have be outstanding. Guy has been an amazing communicator, patient, knowledgeable and caters to our needs. He has been there from the planning, to blueprints, to permits and now almost done with the build."
5,"We could not be happier with our bathroom remodel. Working with Maor (Mike) Tal, the Project Manager, was great. He was always responsive and answered every question we had. The Treeium construction crew was professional, considerate of our time and my family, and did high quality work. We have already talked to Mike about future projects and highly recommend him and his crew."
5,"I started out just getting quotes for refinishing kitchen cabinets, then it became a complete kitchen remodel . After interviewing 3 other companies I went with Treeium.  I connected with project managers Mike Tal, right from the start.  When you have strangers coming in and out of your home for 6 weeks you better like them and I did.  Every worker who came in was great.

  Thank you Mike :)"
4,"“Treeium” a good company

We recently had a bathroom remodel done in our 100 year home in Pasadena.  We went through a selection process of four potential contractors and although Treeium was not the lowest price, we liked their presentation best. We were very pleased with our decision.  Erez, the project manager, was excellent: responsive, easy to work with, and he listened to what we wanted. Treeium’s work teams, tiling (Juan) and plumbing (Marcello) in particular,  were exceptional. Also, all the work crews were very neat and cleaned the area throughly each day. The end result was a bathroom remodel better than we had hoped for and at the price we agreed to."
5,"Wow!!!!

If I am only allowed one word to describe our remodeling experience with Treeium, it would be “Wow”!! 

Disclaimer:  We are not the easiest clients to please; and we do our due diligence extensively.  My wife had prepared a page or 2 full of questions and interviewed 5-6 highly ranked/highly recommended contractors; and ranked them based on points on a spreadsheet.  Objectively, at the end of this process, Treeium came out on top.  Subjectively, we also chose Treeium, as two of the people we know had remodeled recently with Treeium and both recommended this firm.

Our project would be a pretty big project:  We want to update our kitchen and remove two load bearing walls to make our living room/dining room/kitchen into one big open space.  This meant opening   up the roof and put in two supporting beams.  Build an island in the kitchen area.  Switch the stove from one side of the kitchen to the other. Get new appliances and cabinets.  Seal off one of two fireplaces.  Build tiled deco wall where the chimney were.  Completely re-do a downstairs bathroom that has been very dilapidated.  Change a study room into a bedroom.  Wall off part of the family and make it into a storage room.   Move the entry door a few feet away to create a bigger laundry room.  Change an existing storage room into a study room.  Change the flooring on our master bedroom from carpet to tile.  Change the hard wood floor to tile for nearly the entire house.  Re pipe the old galvanized pipes to copper for water.  Re pipe the old gas pipes.  Termite treating the house.  Painting the exterior of the house and most of the interior.  Termite tenting of the whole house.  Building new wrought iron side gates and fences.  In short, 95% of our house is being remodeled.  

That being said, my review will rate Treeium based on Timing (delay), Cost, Quality, and Customer Service.

Timing:
Right from the get go, the project manager, Lior, came to our house and listened to what we wanted to do.  He suggested that we meet with his designer to go over what we want; and the designer came out with a design that really did accentuated everything we had wanted.  The permitting process followed the architectural and engineering studies, and everything went through without a hitch.  Within a few weeks after signing the contract, we were ready for the demolition process.  

At the beginning of this process, I had asked our project manager just how long this project would take.  He told me that this project should be done in 2 months.  I did not believe him when I first heard it; because I know delays are usually to be expected in any remodeling project.  Our previous remodeling done 10 years earlier with much smaller scope was completed in 4 months.  So I was skeptical when I heard that this would be done in 2 months.  The project ended up taking 2.5 months.  The extra 2 weeks were actually not Treeium’s fault; instead it was due the conditions of the house once they opened the walls, and some of the upgrades we wanted after the project had started.  So, I was quite amazed when the project ended up pretty much completed on time.  

So, wow!!

Cost:
Treeium is not the low cost leader out of the many contractors we had interviewed.  Treeium is not the most expensive either.  Its quote falls on par with most of the quotes within a few percentage points.  At the end, we did not pick Treeium because of its price quote; but purely based on how well it scored on our own ratings mentioned above, and how highly recommended they were by their former clients.

Quality of the workmanship:
Wow!!  I don’t exactly know much about construction, so obviously I can’t tell whether whatever Treeium did behind the walls (plumbing, wiring, framing) were great in quality.  I can, however, tell that the finished product, with the entertainment cabinets, the kitchen cabinets, the island, the flooring, painting, and many more, are very much high quality, with definite attention to details. The hardwares used are also top notch.  

In my previous remodeling projects, we had custom ordered cabinets from Home Depot.  These cabinets from Treeium are exponentially better, with soft closing on all of the doors.   

The scope had included installation of recessed ceiling lights for several areas.  Treeium did above and beyond that, and replaced some of my older recessed lights to LED recessed lights.  

In previous projects, the contractors were capable in doing exactly what they needed to do.  Treeium not only did what was in the scope; on many occasions, Treeium went above and beyond what were in the scope.  And, again, everything Treeium did was done well.

Customer Service:

So far, as you may tell, I am truly impressed with Treeium.  But, what really earned my “wow” review, is Treeium’s approach to customer service.  Right after the contracts are signed, Lior, the project manager starts to provide almost daily updates of where Treeium is in the process and what we need to do to get prepared (such as packing and moving out).  Once the project got started with the demolition, the project manager would keep us apprised of everything that’s going on in the house that day, and provide us with a “progress report” and what to expect next.  So, we were kept in the loop every step of the way.  

In addition, obviously with a project this size, some hiccups are to be expected, such as damages caused by the demolition/remodeling.  Those are unavoidable.  Another reason Treeium and Lior earned the “wow” from me is how quickly they respond to our concerns and how well they addressed those concerns.  At the end of the project, we had prepared a punch list of all the items that needed to be fixed due to damages from this remodeling.  Within a matter of days, they were able to fix everything on the punch list, often times to better conditions than they were before this remodeling project.  No delays, no excuses, just get them done.

Wow!!

We have moved back home for 5 days now; and every moment I am here, I look around and remember the way it was before this project, I can’t help but be amazed how quickly this whole project come together; and how satisfied I am with the final result.  

So, wow!!!  Kudos to Treeium and Kudos to Lior, our project manager; and thank you for a surprisingly pleasant experience."
5,"I had been wanting to fix my wooden floor which had been rotting away for the last 7 years due to moisture.  So I was googling home improvement companies, and had 2 companies to come n look at the rotting floor to see what they would say, how they would go about figuring out the cause of the moisture, etc. None of the sales people impressed me enough so I didn't bother to get an estimate for cost. Instead I googled for more companies n saw Treeium. Their website n reviews sounded good enough so I had Treeium send me a salesman. It turned out they actually dispatch project managers with experience: Amir and Farid.
They explained to me a thorough work process/procedure they would implement if I were to hire them  which seemed reasonable n professional. Also, it sounded very convenient for me because they had all different kinds of workers/professionals who could diagnose n fix my floor. 
A long story short, I ended up hiring them n had them not only fix my floors but some electrical lines that had been giving us headaches as well. It took over 3 weeks yet I'm glad I had Amir n Farid take care of my house project. They were prompt n quick to understand the work situation n most of all, they knew how to be sensitive to even the smallest concerns I had. No other companies I had worked with previously on other projects was able to meet such standard. (I'm not an easy person to work with/for) 
Also, I really appreciated how they came to inspect the work morning n evening daily. And I was actually impressed that they brought a portable toilet stand for the workers to use. 
Overall, I am fully satisfied with Treeium n the 2 project managers: Amir and Farid. I highly recommend this company."
5,Treeium did top quality work on our master bathroom remodel.  Even the smallest detail that we weren't satisfied with got resolved.  Amir and Farid listened to what we had in mind and offered design suggestions/options that made our bathroom turn out beautiful.  Tile shower and floor turned out great.  We love the new vanity they suggested.  A very high quality job.
5,Jesse Marquez was very helpful in my initial phone call for estimate appt. he seemed very knowledgeable kind and eager to help.
5,"Took longer than expected (4 months), partly due to several inspections that changed the rules several times. In the end Erez, our Project Manager, completed the job as promised. Thank you Treeium."
5,"Our experience with Avi Shushan has been excellent, He kept us informed in every step of the process,
Avi is very responsive and knowledgeable 
He is the most extreme personable and he made us feel very easy with everything.
We will defiantly recommend him to everyone we know."
5,"There are no words to describe the devotion and attention that we have received from Farid Ghaheri, the project manager, and his crew in the remodeling of our house.  Farid is always available and unceasingly polite, attentive and willing to offer suggestions (that are always well thought out).  His crew does superior work and we especially appreciated the work of Robert, one of the foremen, and Carlos, one of the workers.  The work was done promptly and on budget.  There were no surprises and everything was up front.  If you need any work done, hire this company and ask for Farid !"
5,"Farid Ghaheri is our project manager and I couldn't be more satisfied. He is a no pressure very easy personality. He and his crew are very respectful of my home, my dog and my family. They are there when he says they will be and finish projects on time!!! He is patient with me when I make changes. He is totaly unflappable. I have been very happy with the workmanship of the individual componants that make up my new master bath."
5,"I've hired Treeium in the past and this is my 2nd 5-star review for them, I granted the 5 stars chiefly because of our Project Manager Avihen Levanon who efficiently coordinated the difficult task of a complete remodel of my 120-year-old kitchen. The entire kitchen except for the framework was demolished from the ceiling to the floor, including an outside structure attached to the house which had covered up 2 of the original kitchen windows. The kitchen required a lot of electrical upgrading and I appreciate that Treeium adheres to the strict building codes and my kitchen is in full compliance with the city I live in. Another plus for Treeium are the different choices and fine quality of the cabinets, countertops, and flooring I was given to choose from. My kitchen was built to my wishes, I love it and what a delight having the windows restored. Also, it was completed in the time frame stated."
5,"Update - We could not be happier with our new kitchen and the experience working with Treeium.  Everyone at Treeium was extremely professional every step of the way.  Those working on site and those in the office.  Great craftsmanship, excellent communication, punctuality, attention to detail & commitment to our satisfaction.  (We were picky and asked them to tend to small details we felt weren't exactly right and they came right away and said they were committed to making us happy.)  We have worked with other companies during remodels and the experience has NOT always been positive like this.  We highly recommend!  Thank you, Treeium!


We are in the middle of a kitchen & bathroom remodel with Treeium right now and so far we couldn’t be happier.  

Our Project Manager, Guy Borenstein, made us feel like we are all part of the same passionate team on this remodel from the time we first met up until now.  GHe is responsive, makes himself available when we have questions or concerns.  He’s been willing to take the time to walk us through all the steps of our project, (even if he’s already explained it previously) and he checks in to make sure we’re happy each step of the way.  

The first plans we had for our kitchen turned out to be out of our budget, not just with Treeium but with every company we got a bid from.  Guy was able to work with us to suggest ways to cut down the budget and we arrived at a new plan that we are still extremely happy with and with a price we can afford.  

We were told by friends, family, and even by Guy that going into a remodel can feel like your entire home has been turned into a dirty construction site, but we have been very surprised and impressed to find that Treeium is very clean and professional throughout the entire process so far.  They have used floor protection and sectioned off areas of our home from floor to ceiling while they are working, which has kept nearly all of the dust out of the other rooms, then what has surprised us the most, is that when they leave in the afternoon, they remove all plastic and floor protection so we feel completely at home (and clean) until the next morning when they lay down all the floor protection, and section off areas with plastic again - We feel it really shows that they’re going the extra mile so we don’t feel like we’re living in a construction zone.  

All the actual work completed so far has been extremely high quality, on time, and on budget. Everyone working in our home are polite and professional.  Everyone has been willing to explain to us exactly what they are doing, why, how long it will take, etc.  

When the crew demo’d our old kitchen we found some issues in the walls that needed addressing.  (not treeium’s fault).  Treeium was able to rework the schedule to accommodate the new steps required to address those issues.  

So far we’ve only had a single pice of wood that was cracked in the process of the remodel.  They immediately offered to replace it.  


So far 5 star rating for sure!"
1,"This remodel was the WORST experience ever.  We have a very large bathroom and we were quoted $50K and told that it would take 8 weeks but it took over 8 mths.  At the beginning of this project we felt so much pressure to buy a long list of things they needed so that the project wasn’t delayed.  How were we suppose to do that when all we had was a layout and no measurements? Some of the delay with this project was due to the city inspector but ultimately their contractors were fixing errors or redoing things that weren’t done right.  The first thing we were told is that a portion of a load bearing wall would need to be moved.  They sent me the change order and said that it would cost $7,000.  The first thing I asked is what is the $7,000 for?  I was told not to worry that I’d receive a detailed receipt.  What they sent me was vague and didn’t detail anything.  I never should’ve signed that change order without the detailed breakdown in my hands first.  So they used Simpson Strong-Tie hardware which is great but we told them that my husband and I work for Simpson and that we could provide the hardware that was needed.  They claim they were never told this.  I complained and was told that Treeium didn’t buy any product from Simpson.  This might be true if they already had the parts they needed but that doesn’t mean that those costs didn’t trickle down to us.  Another thing that was added to the change order was replacement of the subfloor in the shower.  We had already done the demo for the shower and it was clear when they saw the project that the subfloor would need to be replaced so to add this to the change order is ridiculous.  They replaced clear block tile with a window in the shower but the window was too big thus half of it was in the shower and half out.  They replaced the window but unfortunately the finish didn’t match the other large window that they installed over the tub so they had to replace it yet again.  We noticed the supply line for the toilet was about 10” away from the toilet so it was an eye sore.  I asked them about it and they said, “That is what the inspector advised us to do and we can’t change it.”   I called the inspector the next day and he said, “I don’t have a change order but I have no problem if you want it moved.”   One concern before even starting the project was whether the exterior stucco/paint would match where they put in the windows.  They told us that they paint the whole wall so there’s no worry about a paint match.  Well because that wasn’t written in the contract they claim that they never told us that.  The tub grout started to fail within the first week and we ended up with 6 extra boxes of floor tile.  They did credit our bill for the extra floor tile.  When I tried to use the tub the first time there was a problem with the water pressure.  They ultimately fixed that but when I tried to use the shower the first time there was no cold water so it was scalding hot.  Apparently there was a part in the valve that was broken or that they broke.  A replacement part was bought and they still couldn’t get it to work.  The 2nd Project Mgr (I was told the first one no longer worked there) called me and told me it wasn’t working and asked if he could go buy another shower valve similar to the one we bought.  I said, “That is fine but we won’t accept a cheap replacement”.  He assured me it would be good quality.  I got home to find that they had to remove two of the tiles from the shower (which I knew nothing about) but the part they bought was a cheap $100 replacement and what we bought was almost $300 so we were not happy.  They installed the plumbing for the vanity before the vanity even arrived which meant that the installation was difficult.  According to the contractors doing the work they told us, “You guys bought the wrong size vanity”.”  No one ever told us what size vanity to buy.  The problem was that they put the plumbing in before they even knew what we purchased.  They cut sloppy holes in the shelves of the vanity to accommodate the plumbing and have since fixed this by making new shelves but I’ve lost most of my space on the bottom shelf.  The silicone they put around the toilet came off after about 7-10 days and they grouted around the tub when that should’ve really been silicone.  They ultimately did install silicone around the tub but they also put it in the shower.  We never asked for silicone in the shower and it looks sloppy.  They also countersunk the tub and that wasn’t how it was designed to be installed.  We had an existing pocket door that just needed a new latch on it which they installed but now it’s off track and scratching the paint on both sides.  The only thing they are good at is reminding customers that a payment is due. I would not recommend Treeium to my worst enemy!"
5,"We found Treeium through Houzz. Salesman and Project Manager Avi Shushan was at our house a couple of days later, where he helped us put our remodel ideas together. This was our first remodel, and we were not sure what to expect. We had heard that contractors worked sporadically - but the Treeium experience was continuous. Avi always gave us a heads up on the schedule.  We had pleasant, skilled crews working on our home every day for a month. Avi also has a helpful designer's eye if you are doing your own design work and need a nudge. The stamped concrete guys are artists, as are the tile and paint guys. The results are gorgeous."
5,Guy gave us a bid we could live with.  The contract was clear and through the whole project was exactly as the contract stated.  Payments were easy to make online.  Guy was easy to work with and listened.  The work was done on time.  Antonio cleaned up every night.  Could not be happier with my new kitchen.  Best construction experience ever.
5,"Thank you Lior Lazarovich for a very professional job well done. 
  Lior was always available to us too answer all our requests and questions . Great job Lior, we wish you the best."
5,"Treeium and my project manager, Guy Breuer, really delivered on my bathroom remodel.  They were the 3rd quote I received and I found the fairest of all.  The project came in within scope, on time (actually a little ahead of schedule) and on budget.  Don't forget to include them in your project plan!!"
5,"We met with Erez to discuss our bathroom remodel project. He was very personable, knowledgeable and professional. After interviewing other companies we decided to go with Treeium and were very glad we did.
Erez and his crew did a great job. The bathroom looks awesome. The work was completed on time and the workmanship was top notch.
Would definitely recommend to our family and friends."
5,"Farid is spectacular.
He exceeded my expectations!
He is professional, artistic, punctual, dependable, timely and realistic.
He treats small projects with same respect and professionalism as a big project.
I know because we started off a tiny project but expanded it and are still so very thrilled.
I highly recommend him!! We are already planning phase 2!!!"
5,"We're in the process of doing a room addition to our new house, and recently signed with Treeium. Farid Ghaheri is managing the project and we can't praise him highly enough. From the very first meeting, he's been professional, articulate, and punctual -- most of the time he's early (very important to us, with our tight schedules!). Farid walked us through the entire process and timeline, and was always honest and realistic with his recommendations and estimates. Treeium in general has been wonderful to work with for several reasons: 1) their user-friendly and transparent online portal; 2) set cost; 3) versatility with adding to the scope of work; 4) their economy of scale, with several crews and professionals available to do whatever needs to be done, when it needs to be done. We discussed budget with Farid very early on, and by the time we got to the contract and detailed scope of work, the price he gave us was right in the initial range he quoted us. One of the best things about how Farid works is that he always has examples of recent or ongoing projects to illustrate his ideas; he's a wizard with his iPhone and laptop. Farid is extremely responsive to texts, emails, and calls, and always impresses us with how frequently he's available to swing by our home to discuss an idea or to check on someone's work. You're in good hands with Treeium, and especially with Farid."
5,Thank you for the initial information on how you work.  The video is also helpful. I look forward to getting a proposal.
5,"So far the kitchen is looking good.Daniel is very positive, friendly, and personable. We would recommend Treeium to others, they have a great quality assurance representative Darrell."
5,"Spoke with Nina who was very helpful and professional in answering a few of my questions and making me feel that working with Treeium could be a good fit for us. 
I look forward to our initial appointment next week to find out more. Thank you Nina"
5,Lisa was very pleasant to speak to. She was my first exposure to Treeium and gave me enough confidence in the company that I setup the initial appointment.
4,"Treeium and Itay, the Project Manager, were very good.  They came on time, fallowed all of my directions, came back promptly if I thought something else needed to be done, and completed the project within a decent period of time.  I would recommend them for bathroom remodels.  The cost was reasonable for the job done."
5,"We needed to remodel our 2 bedroom condo in Culver City and needed it done quickly because we were paying for two mortgages at the same time. Erez Shifferman came and after chatting for a few minutes with my wife and me he immediately understood our ideas and concerns and provided many helpful suggestions on how to save time and money with our project. Not only is he knowledgeable about all aspects of remodeling, but is also honest and upfront with all the costs. Some contractors might give you a low estimate at the beginning and surprise you with extra charges down the road, but this is never the case with Erez and Treeium because they are such a reputable and old company and they have an ironclad reputation to defend!"
5,"Amazing company to work with.
The crew is honest, reliable and professional.

The are prompt and always available if you need them.

I highly recommend Treeium."
5,"the workmanship is excellent.  all of the men were on the job on time, finished job in a timely manner--as promised.  house looks great.  so good i have just hired treeium to do another job for me, bigger than first.  i trust them to care for my home as i do.  farid, the project manager has integrity.  he looks out for me and my home as if it were his own.  he arrives for appointments when he says he will.  i couldn't be happier with the whole experience. i will use them again and again.  thank you, treeium team."
5,"I ordered a 308sqft aluminum patio cover to reduce the sun exposure on my back bedroom. Not only does the cover look great, but how things progressed was impressive. 
1. I was given an up front price that was in line with competitors. I chose them due to other good reviews they have had.
2. The project was timed and well managed by Erez, who coordinated the permit, the materials purchase and the installation. 
3. The installation passed inspection the first time and was well done. Built per plan. 

Overall this was was a very pleasant and efficient engagement of an impeccable business. I highly recommend Treeium."
5,"We just started working with Treeium in the preliminary phase and so far so good! They are extremely professional and timely. My husband and I just started the process, and, in the meantime, we won a $200 Amazon gift card by completing a survey for them! We were so excited! Adriana Villasenor and Don Mkhitarian hand delivered the gift card to our home and were super sweet and helpful. It’s safe to say we are looking forward to working with them and our project manager Don Mkhitarian!"
5,"Sam Deen and his crew did an excellent job in remodeling our master bathroom.  Everyone was very courteous, on time, cleaned the site daily and respected our work days and hours.  They made my dream bathroom come true."
5,"We recently had a bathroom remodel done by Treeium and were very happy with their work and especially with our project manager, Farid.  Their workers showed up on time, worked diligently on the project, and cleaned up each day when they were done.  Farid was on site every day to make certain the work was progressing, and he was also a huge help with the design details and in making sure everything was done to our liking.  The job was completed professionally and on time and looks great!  We would definitely give 5 stars to Farid and Treeium."
5,"Always a scary proposition trusting in a construction/remodeling company, but we really lucked out with Treeium. Initially contacted by Guy Breuer, who was to be the project manager on our master bath remodel. He gave us a quote that was far less than 2 other contractors and promised the work would be completed in 4 weeks. He lied. It was done in just under 3 weeks!! 
Guy was very helpful in recommending tile and bathroom fixture companies in the area and we found exactly what we were looking for (thanks Russ at Modello Tile). What I really think made all the difference was the crew that we had for our project. Shout out to Miguel, Liverado and the rest of Juan's crew, true craftsmen. Clean, efficient and showed up every day until completion.
Truly an amazing and easy experience. I strongly suggest at least making Treeium one of your quotes."
5,"Ashley was very professional, reviewing my remodeling needs and scheduling a project estimator to meet with me.  Selection will be based on proposal."
5,"The Irvine team, headed by Farid are so professional. I appreciate all the workers from the demo team to the tile men to the plumbers. They are polite, personable, receptive to questions and input, clean up when they are done and very good at what they do. You will not regret hiring this team. Kara"
5,Tomer is remarkably reliable and responsive.  He conducted himself and subcontractors in an effiicent and professional manner.   We will be using Treeium and Tomer again soon.
5,"After interviewing several contractors, for a kitchen remodel, we awarded the contract to Treeium, and I am glad we did.

From the onset, they were professional, clean, neat, reliable, and the end result is an amazing kitchen that we love.

Our Project manager was Assaf Labi.  He and his team of experts came in measured drew and gave us a quote.  From start to finish Assaf coordinated everything.  We talked to him on a daily basis.  He texted to make sure all was clean when the crew left for the evening.

I was amazed that even during the demolition phase, there was no dust in adjoining rooms.  They had the place sealed tight.

The quality of our cabinets is outstanding and the workmanship for installation if perfect. Their designer came up with different ideas.  We kept making changes until we were happy.  She knew her stuff.

I highly recommend Treeium for any remodel you want to do.  They are a reliable company.  With all the nightmares you hear about contractors, we did not experience any problems."
5,"I first met Guy Borenstein and then he became like a brother figure.  He came, inspected, gave an estimate, brought the crew, and did the job on time and as per their estimate.  I definitely recommend him and Treeium for any renovation or upgrade you need around your house."
5,"When I decided to remodel/enlarge my bathroom and build new closets, I wasn't sure I'd find someone who can build exactly what I wanted, especially since we had to deal with HOA rules and CCRs 
Erez Schifferman ruled over the job and dealt with all the hiccups that always happen when remodeling and construction is done, in a very professional and friendly way. I'm not sure I would've survived this without him being on top of all of it. Oh and I'm quite surprised that he survived my complaining during the last 3 months"
5,"I’m so over joyed with the experience we have had with Erez Schifferman!  He hasn’t represented this company with outstanding professionalism, patience, and motivation.  We had a terrible experience with a different company so we were very nervous about dealing with contractors once again but Erez has made sure that all our questions have been answered and had reassured through the project!  We’re almost done with our project and are overly pleased!"
5,We had our front and backyard re landscaped with drought tolerant plants and materials. Erez Shifferman was responsive to every request we had to make our yard perfect. When there were questions /problems ( as there are with all construction projects ) Erez was available immediately  and addressed every one in a timely and in a more than satisfactory manner. I would recommend Erez Shifferman and Treeium for any and all of your home remodel needs.
5,"We hired Treeium to remodel our master bathroom. Guy Borenstein was very easy to work with and followed through with us every step of the way. The crews were professional, did good work were friendly and always cleaned up after each job. Our remodel was done in a timely manner and we are very pleased."
5,"So far Treeium and our head contractor, Guy Borenstein, have done an amazing job on our open concept kitchen remodel. And we are not easy customers! We had load bearing walls removed, beams placed within the ceiling, concrete footings poured under the house, our hardwood floors seamlessly matched to run from the living room into the kitchen, drywall on the walls and ceiling is perfectly flat, and all has gone smoothly. Meanwhile we are still living in the house so they sealed off the rest of the house with zipper entry doorways, and the dreaded dust that we were so afraid of has been kept to a minimum. They are even sticking to their budget and timeline. I’ve been warned these days that is not to be expected! We should know because we have experienced the worst with other contractors.  So I feel the need to shout off the mountain tops how awesome these guys are. We can’t wait to see the finished product!"
5,"We just had our house remodel completed by Treeium and we couldn’t be happier.  We started with the kitchen demolition which honestly made my wife cry.  But the kitchen that was built in its place is like a dream come true.  Our Project Manager, Lior Lazarovich took our old tired kitchen and gave us a new house.  I can’t believe this is the same house we lived in for 7 years.  I’m truly blown away by the quality of their work.  5 Stars all the way.  Thanks again Lior Lazarovich and Treeium."
5,"One of the greatest experiences I has while remodeling my home. Great company, great customer service and workmanship. I was very impressed by the professionalism of my project manager, he managed my project which was a gate replacement and a kitchen remodel in a very timely matter. I'm very happy with my decision and would highly recommend this company to my friends."
5,"There were some problems and delays.  However, they promised to complete all punch list items by December 11, 2017.  It is extremely satisfying to receive clear commitments from Treeium!"
4,"I don't think any contractor is perfect and deserves 5 stars since there is always room for improvement.  But, we are very happy with Treeium's work and the results of our project.

We completed our house remodel with Treeium in April 2017.  It was an extensive project requiring us to move out of the house for 8 months.  We added a bathroom, shifted the location of our kitchen, completely rebuilt an old addition with new vaulted ceilings, upgraded all the electrical, new HVAC, and tankless water heater.

We found Treeium on Home Advisor and selected them for these reasons:
1.  They are a local company, which made communication/meetings very easy.
2.  We liked the idea that they did not sub out their workers.  The same foreman, Mika, and his crew of 5-6 guys were here throughout the entire project, with additional specialty contractors such as electrical, tile layer, HVAC installer.
3.  The salesperson, Guy Borenstein, was very good-natured and we thought he would be an easy person to work with.  Turned out to be true.
4.  They could also take care of the engineering plans and we would not have to hire a separate engineer/architect.
5.  They state that the customer will not incur additional costs above the initial bid for contractor mistakes or misjudgments.  This was absolutely true.

While I don’t think that any construction projects are perfect and without stress, we were generally pleased with Treeium for their work ethic and attention to customer expectation.  They were very efficient during the work schedule and we were consistently updated with the progress.  Any mistakes/errors (which are inevitable) were quickly taken care of.  We are truly enjoying our newly remodeled home and have referred Treeium to several of our friends interested in remodeling their homes.

Our biggest complaints would be the following: (1) they were sometimes insensitive to our schedules (asking us to immediately run out and purchase items needed for the house); (2) the communication between various workers/crew was sometimes lacking; (3) more time and attention could have been paid to drywall finishing; and, (4) the crew could have done a better job maintaining our existing landscape (we are still digging concrete pieces and construction debris out of our lawns).  Fairly small issues considering the scope of our project.

Overall, I would recommend Treeium for your house project.  Compared to the nightmare stories I have heard about other contractors, Treeium is a reliable company and genuinely tries their best for the customer."
5,"FANTASTIC AND FOLLOW UP!  I highly recommend Treeium.
We used Treeium to renovate our kitchen.  I got bids from 6 different companies and Treeium was neither the least nor the most expensive.  But, Ron was able to show photos of previous work and also seemed the most sincere.  We needed to have the kitchen finished in 5 weeks as we wanted it done before we moved into the house.  Ron and his team finished the job on time and within the budget.  
They've come over several times to make the smallest of adjustments for me.  As a matter of fact, 4 months after the job, the kitchen faucet was loose and Ron sent someone to fix it and at no charge.
We plan on renovating our baths soon and Ron and Treeium will be the first team we call."
5,"We had an entire house remodeled and worked with PG Mr Ron Amondy and Mr Allan Nagar. They and their crews were professional, punctual and responsible the whole time. The quote was also closed to the actual cost at the end. We were happy  and satisfied with their service and will highly recommend them to anyone who need a remodel service."
5,"Assaf was my project manager. He did an outstanding job. My kitchen and bathroom were totally gutted and remodeled. He is experienced, knowledgeable, supportive, and well organized. He kept constant communication with me throughout the construction process which I appreciated. Assaf provided me with guidance when it was time to choose appliances, sinks, flooring, countertops, etc. 

I have a high end kitchen now that functions to meet my needs. My bathroom looks elegant. What a difference!

5,"We had a master bathroom redone. Eli was tremendous as both a person and as a project manager. The work was all excellent and the process smooth. All details were thoroughly discussed and changes requested along the way were accommodated graciously.
All of the workers were pleasant and courteous. Definitely a recommendation from us!"
5,"Yay! I’m finally done with my project and I want to extend my sincere gratitude to Erez Shifferman & Treeium. Erez, you brought trust back to my realm of working with contractors, thank you so much for everything you’ve done for me! I interviewed Erez as a part of cautiously trying to commit to executing a general remodel that I was thinking of for a long time, and I immediately connected with him. I knew right then and there that I would work well with him because you definitely want to feel comfortable and communicate well with the person who is going to be in charge of your once in a life time remodeling project. In my opinion, this is true to any scale project, not necessarily an involved and longer one. 
Erez was able to show me his company profile, all of their contractors licenses and paperwork. This put my mind at ease and I decided to go with Treeium. Now, when the project is completed , I’m happy to say that the quality of the workmanship and attention to detail blow me away. I am very pleased with all of the work done. Erez was always available by text or phone call, and he spent a lot of time helping me make decisions and going over options. I never felt rushed or that my needs were not met.
The entire process went smoothly despite the fact that my daughter and I lived in the home the entire time. I even have two inside dogs and they always made sure to keep their water bowl full and put them outside and clean up when needed. Every room was transformed beautifully. It looks like a new home! Actually, the project took longer than expected because I ended up adding more and more to the original scope of work after I saw how smooth, worry free and well handled the process has been. I figured I might as well get it all done and finish my dream list. Communication was key for me throughout the process, and Erez masters that very well, regardless to what time the clock reads. Bottom line, I was very well served with nothing but professionalism, great quality of workmanship, communication  and honesty. Thank you again Erez & Treeium for a very well done job! I highly recommend Treeium and Erez for your home and all of your contracting needs. You won’t be disappointed!"
5,Treeium demolished our combination bathtub/shower in order to install a walk-in shower with a sliding door to accommodate my 84-year-old father who moved in with us. The shower is aesthetically very attractive and works well to meet my Dad's needs. The workmen were courteous and the project manager Erez was on top of the project and communicated well with us every step of the way.
5,"Treeium remodeled our kitchen and it came out beautifully. We found Treeium through Home Advisor. I wanted to remodel the old kitchen we had because I continuously kept getting splinters. So we remodeled with Treeium and our kitchen is simply amazing. Very impressed with the precision of the cabs & countertops. They made sure everything is sealed. If Treeium would make a mistake, they graciously corrected the concern. Very professional, hard working company. Communication could have been better between labor workers. Overall the experience was great. Benjamin was the best project manager. He kept in touch with us, and addressed all of our concerns. Very punctual and communication with him was great. I definitely will consider working with Benjamin & Treeium again!"
5,"One word:   Excellent.  The renovation was completed with ease AND ahead of schedule.  The cost was relative to the renovation.  The project manager, Liran Avital, was extremely valuable.  He was at my disposal at any hour including, but not limited to 11:30 p.m., when I could respond to various forms of communication.  Mr. Avital took very good care of my investment.  His foreman, Caesar, and his crew were extremely tidy, diligent, meticulous and patient in every aspect of the renovation.  If Caesar had a question about the design, he asked and fully understood sometimes vague instructions.  The designer, Natalie, did a fabulous job on suggesting the appropriate backsplash, cabinetry and appropriate handles.  The kitchen cabinets are self-closing with a spice rack and lazy Susan contained therein.  Treeium was an excellent choice."
5,"Treeium provided us with excellent, tasteful kitchen and bathroom remodelIng within our budget.  Our condo is now stylish and ready for rental!  Prior to contacting Treeium, we had gone through the estimation process with two big box companies, which we decided not to use because of their ""out-of-a can"" offerings and dishonest estimation practices.  From telephone reception to oversight to the finishing touches, Treeium was professional, expeditious and friendly in their dealings.  Project Manager Guy Breuer warmly walked us through the entire process, explaining what sorts of things might be discovered that would affect the scope of work, and therefore cost.  He and his team of excellent contractors not only carried out the work, but also made important aesthetic suggestions based on their experience.  We are very happy we went with them and would not hesitate to contact Treeium again for any remodeling work!"
5,My experience with Treeium was great. My project manager was Lior Lazarovich and he was great . I will most likely choose Treeium for future renovations. I have no complaints for Lior. He did an amazing job assisting my needs and addressed all my concerns.
4,My name is Ben. I had my sons fiancé's kitchen remodeled and I have to say everything went ok. I had to leave town for a weekend and project manager Lior was amazing at managing their renovation. I had left specific instructions to install a delicate vintage style stove to their kitchen as a wedding gift. Everything went great! And they're very happy and satisfied with the remodel.
5,"Treeium and Erez Shifferman our project manager were amazing! We’ve suffered through way too many hot summers in our own home until we just couldn’t take it anymore. We met with several companies in the process of trying to wrap our heads around costs and different solutions for our needs. Erez stood out from the crowd right from the get-go with professionalism, communication, honesty and overall good vibe. We were very impressed with his expertise, knowledge and how he carried himself overall. Erez kept in touch with us after our initial meeting and made us feel very comfortable towards the next meeting we lined up with him to go over specifics of the project and get everything going. Erez delivered everything he promised and I simply can’t believe how smooth our project was handled considering all the elements of the project, which included removal of a giant 50ft tall tree, re-insulating our attic including 2 attic exhaust fans, re-painting our entire house, installing brand new AC units in all the bedrooms and the cherry on the icing - 3,500sf of beautiful energy efficient drought tolerant landscaping that completely transformed our front and back yards from desert like no man’s land to beautifully designed yards we’re now proud of! We want to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to Erez, we’re truly blown away by the service and attention we received from him, we simply can’t imagine the process being any smoother or worries free than what it was. Now that the project is completed, we’re happy to contribute our review to the list of reviews Erez is so proud of, we now know he works very hard towards making his customers happy and satisfied so the least we can do is share our story with others - if you’re reading this review and thinking to work with Treeium, do yourself a favor and ask to meet with Erez, he’s a needle in a haystack!"
5,"We remodeled a second bathroom.  Complete gut job, changing bathtub to shower removing a soffit.  The project manager was Lior, who was excellent at communicating with us as the project progressed.  We are very happy with the result!"
5,"Erez Shifferman was our project coordinator. We moved out of state while the work was being done. Erez was great and very easy to work with remotely - he kept in touch regularly, also often sending photos of progress. He handled purchasing of items, so that we didn't have to worry about that. He gave us confidence that Treeium was doing good work while we were many miles away, and made it a stress-free experience for us.

After the work was done, we made a quick trip back to see it in-person. We were very satisfied with the overall quality of work by Treeium."
5,"When great work is combined with exceptional service the results is always fun.

The project is almost completed. A few minor changes need to be done; However Treeium did an excellent job. Took their time to bring the most out of the work and made adjustments as 

Based on the overall craftsmanship and the quality of each character, Gustavo (cab installer) Roy (electrician), Jaime (the painter) and Phillip (the tile man) need a raise. 

It is a pleasant home owner experience. Strongly recommend Treeium to do your remodel. They stand as a professional contractor because it is critical for increasing the value of your home. The RIGHT way

Have a great day.

Victor Lesley"
5,"The last thing that you want to be told when you move into your new home is that you have mold and that they will need to test, isolate, rip out, and reconstruct the affected area. When that reality set in within a week or so after we had moved in, we were heartbroken. While it hurt, we knew that we needed to take care of the issue immediately. When we hired Treeium to perform the work, we were very impressed by Farid’s knowledge and experience. His explanation of the situation and what steps were needed to remediate were thorough and complete. Farid maintained proper communication throughout the entire project and the Treeium staff who performed the work were incredibly professional and skilled. We thank Treeium for making our home safe and healthy."
5,"I had Treeium remove my old HVAC and replace it with a new one. My project manager was Tomer Turjeman. He was truly fantastic to work with. He was very helpful in helping decide on the best approach for the install and was very diligent in following up with the details. On top of that, he was a great conversationalist and was very respectful and friendly with my mother (who is staying with me for a bit). She was at the house during the project and really enjoyed talking with Tomer. She commented many times on how great Tomer and the rest of the Treeium team were. Tomer is the primary reason for my 5-star rating.

The work was completed with high quality and the new HVAC works very well. This is the first summer at the house where we were able to keep it consistently cool. We're very pleased with it. My only point of critical feedback is that Treeium is on the higher end pricing-wise and I would have liked to see a more transparent breakdown of the job costs.  I did not decrease my rating for this, however, because it was ultimately my decision to move forward and the job came in exactly at the agreed upon cost.

Excellent work, Tomer and team! We're very pleased."
5,"I had the pleasure of dealing with Guy Borenstein in working on a
proposal that fit my budget and he did everything he possibly could to meet that criteria and I was satisfied with the final proposal. He is so honest and real and I truly appreciated that. Unfortunately for Treeium, I decided to sell my condo ""as is."" I love trees and I love the fact the Treeium plants a tree at the completion of each renovation. Wish I could have been part of that. I highly recommend Guy Borenstein in particular at Treeium and their spectacular work (as you'll see on their website). I could not have had a more pleasant experience."
5,"After several difficult attempts with other contractors for our kitchen remodel, we finally landed on Treeium, and the fantastic Project Manager Oshrat. She was very attentive, honest, and responsive. She addressed every question or concern I had along the way and completed to job in a timely manner. The project was only a partial kitchen remodel (new quartz counters, marble backsplash, new sink and faucet), but we were always treated us like a big-ticket customer. We went into the project with a firm budget and only had one surprise with some electrical work that needed to be done. Oshrat was always mindful of our budget and even with the extra expense we still ended up under budget. Allen and Marvin did a lot of the work for our project and did a great job. I tend to be a perfectionist and notice all the little things. Every time I pointed something out they were always quick to fix it. Even a few weeks after the project was completed, I found a few small things that were not to my liking. I texted Oshrat, and she was ontop of it and said they would fix anything that was not to my liking. I would recommend Treeium in a heartbeat!!"
5,"I have partnered with Treeium to acquire more clients with larger design projects. 
The team is very innovative, creative and thorough and I look forward to working with  them for their professionalism and follow up."
5,"Erez is the best! If you’re thinking to hire Treeium for your home remodeling project and you were lucky enough to meet with Erez, let me save you some reading time - all the other reviews Erez has online are 100% accurate and truly describe this fine young man. Now, when the project is completed, I am very pleased to add my own review! We hired Treeium and Erez to replace our roof after meeting with a few companies, but not feeling as comfortable with them both on the personal and professional side. Since we had a bad experience with a different contractor in the past, we were very picky and selective this time around.. Erez took his time with ease when he met with us (twice!) and explained everything thoroughly. After we awarded Erez the project, first thing he said to me was “now it’s time for me to start proving myself to you”, and this is exactly what Erez has done throughout the project. We passed all inspections on the first shot and now we can comfortably leave for our vacation as we were able to meet a very tight schedule for completing our project. Thank you Erez so much for delivering everything you promised and as well for a well done job!"
5,"I would highly recommend working with Guy Breuer from Treeium, Inc for any of your future home improvement projects. My wife and I had the pleasure of his help and services this past year on the construction of our addition. Guy was very helpful, easy to communicate with, and transparent with the project. He and his crew were very efficient and thorough when it came to executing each part of the job. They were all very respectful and friendly as well. I am happy to say that Guy and Treeium help to build a safe home for my family.

James, Alameda CA"
5,Talked to 2 contractors  and felt like they weren't listening to me.. I knew my budget and I knew what I wanted..  Was ready to just save my hard earned money and give up my dream addition util I met the 3rd  contractor Guy Breuer with Treeium.. He's not a sales rep he's a Project Manager and he gave me common sense options not UP SELLING options i didn't need..  I had a real good feeling about Guy and what he said Treeium would deliver . So I signed on the dotted line and now i have  my dream room addition.. He met all times lines and his work crew's were top notch.. Thanks Guy..
5,"My wife and I selected Treeium to paint the interior of our home and it was a great experience.  Guy Portal explained all of our options and was patient and understanding as we selected our color choices.  His staff performed flawlessly, completing the job on time and leaving our home clean and looking beautiful.  We wouldn't hesitate to consider Treeium again for future projects.

Steve M"
5,"Treeium was amazing! I was referred to them by a close friend that did a bunch of work on her place after a major water leak. She loved them and said they are very fast, have fair prices and are easy to communicate with.

I had a water leak in my tentants unit. I explained to them that my tenants wanted to get back in their home ASAP. They were constantly doing whatever they could to make things go faster. They said my project would be completed in about 8 days or so. They finished it in about 5 instead. Everything looks great! They went the extra mile and helped us find the best matching materials, they were easy to communicate with and answered every text and call within minutes. That is definitely not the case with most contractors. They under-promised and overdelivered on everything! Erez, The Project Manager, was amazing! He is very personable, went out of his way to help in any way he could. After this project, I honestly feel like I have a new personal friend. I would not hesitate to hire them again!"
5,"Liran Avital and the Treeium crew completed a full kitchen and bathroom remodel for us, and we are thrilled with the results! We have had some nightmarish experiences in the past so we were reluctant to take this project. After contacting Treeium  and meeting with Liran in person, he gave us all the confidence we needed, we interviewed 2 other companies before and after we met Liran and let me tell you this, no one were even close to the professionalism and the well established reputation Treeium have and the way Liran went through every aspect of the project with us. so we decided to move forward with Treeium and so glad we did! From the start, Liran patiently worked with us to draw up the plans, scope of work, budget and timeline. His expertise and suggestions made all the difference in ensuring we made the most out of the space we have. Liran was on site overseeing his crew for flawless execution. He lent his expertise in helping me select final touches like drawer pulls, kitchen faucets and lighting and bathroom layout and design. The crew was very  polite, nice and clean throughout the whole time of the remodeling. Every day I received emails or phone calls updating me what was happening, who was coming and going, when payments were due etc. I felt completely looped in and reassured at the overall coordination of all the people involved, everything Liran had promised he delivered! This is a top notch company and Liran was a fantastic project manager and was very easy to work with . The project was completed on time. Liran is honest, detail oriented and very professional. Thank you Liran and the Treeium crew for my new kitchen and bathroom. It was a pleasure to work with you. We highly recommend Liran Avital  and Treeium crew for smooth, peaceful remodeling process and quality work for everyone who is thinking to remodel his house!"
5,I hired Treeium for my remodeling project and couldn’t be happier with my decision. I had a wonderful experience with the company and my project manager Guy Borestein. He was always available for me throughout the entire process. He gave us an excellent customer service. Out project turned out great. Once again thank you Treeium for a job well done.
1,"We worked with Guy who is very personable, but the job that needed to be done took well over the time we were told  I understand that there are complications when doing a complex design, but the communication was horrible and took well over 6 months!   

We were very clear in our expectations and when it came to the build we didn't actually hire Treeium.  Their bid was more than $100K over what we were bid by other companies.  They tried to work with us and give us discounts, but in the end we went with another contractor.  

This is where things were very frustrating.  We were told the plans would be complete and ready to build.  There were issues with the plans that the contractor had to modify (simple measurements and walls where there couldn't be).  These small issues my contractor was able to work with the inspectors but the biggest issue was the retaining walls below our build.  They didn't put them where needed, nor tall enough and when we called them back to fix the problem, we were billed almost $1000 to fix!  We are still fighting them to not pay for this bill.  Instead of responding to us and fixing the problem they say we should expect changes!    I can see if we changed the plans  - but this was a blatant mistake by the engineer and we should NOT be billed because they did the plans wrong in the first place - DISAPPOINTING to say the least!  :("
5,"Up to this point am very happy with the work performed,Erez was there answering my questions and concerns,thank you"
5,"I’ve known Erez Shifferman for years now but I’ve never had the need to work with him professionally for any of the construction services he offers. When I learned Erez offers energy efficient upgrades as an energy upgrade California contractor and after discussing some ideas, I felt very comfortable with letting Erez perform the upgrades to my home. Needless to say, Erez made the experience flawless and super smooth even when I was out of state for the majority part of the work. Erez is one of those people you immediately feel like you can trust, as he’s a straight shooter, professional, personable and honest. My energy efficient upgrades are making a huge difference to my home and I’m very content with the work performed. Thank you Erez for making this happen for me and I’m happy we could do business together!"
5,"I acquired several bids to remodel my home and was very pleased to have contracted with Treeium, Inc.  My projects varied in expertise from building a second story wrap around deck, replacement of custom skylights, redoing the concrete driveway and other varied projects to bring my older home up to date.  Dotan, the Project Manager, was professional, knowledgeable, organized, and made time to make sure I was updated on all facets of the project, including communicating with me outside of business hours.  Furthermore, the Treemium team was pleasant, courteous and respectful of my property.  I would recommend them to anyone who is considering remodeling their home and would hire Treeium, Inc. again."
5,"Excellent job was done by Treeium & their crew. After looking around for over 3 months for a good contractor, I was finally referred to Treeium. Their project manager was friendly, knowledgeable, professional and most of all honest!! Absolutely no pressure tactics which made me feel comfortable with him. We decided to go with them to remodel our kitchen & do some landscaping in the backyard. They installed artificial turf and water-conversant plants and now my backyard looks beautiful. My kitchen was really old, needed everything updated. They gave me new cabinets, countertops, tile, and lighting. It literally looks like a new house and my friends are always astonished when they come over. 

I want to personally thank Treeium for the help and making this whole process easy. You took care of absolutely everything and your entire crew was very nice and polite the whole time. Don't know what I would've done without you. I'll definitely recommend treeium to everyone!"
5,"I found Treeium and hired them for a full high-end remodel of an existing 2,600 SF home in Playa del Rey, which was an investment/flip. They were well-priced, fair, very experienced and their workmanship was exceptional. They have multiple offices and a large staff, which was comforting to know going into the job. Guy Barnea and Ron Admony both acted as the PM's and they were fantastic. They were easily accessible throughout the entire process and the only change orders we had on the job were for scope that I decided to add at my own discretion. Would definitely use again."
5,"I did a complete remodel of a mobile home in Camarillo Springs (where you own the land), with Treeium. They did an amazing job and the service and quality were all amazing. They took everything down to the studs and built a home that you would NEVER know now is a mobile home. Ari and Guy were amazing and took care of everything from beginning to end! 
I highly recommend them!
Doris S."
5,"I was refereed to Treeium by a friend of mine because he had heard the horror stories I've had with other contractors in the past. He told me they were professional, reliable, and high quality..and wow he was right! Best remodeling experience I've ever had. We did a complete new roof for our home and it came out beautiful. All the workers were very friendly, and I was constantly kept updated as the project was progressing. I strongly recommend Treeium and will for sure be using them again."
4,"After waiting approximately 12 to 13 years to make a decision to semi-remodel our 1947 kitchen, we found ourselves hunting for the right company to perform high quality work for us in a timely fashion. We interviewed approximately 6 to 7 companies and we decided to award the contract Treeuim to do the work.  Our project manager is Guy Bornstein and I can't say enough about his enthusiasm and professionalism! He represents his company well, and while we are in week two of our remodel so far most everything is going well and I can't wait to update our friends & family when everything is finished!"
5,"Guy Borenstein is the guy you want leading your project!!!!! I can't say enough about him and his crew. An absolute professional. Everything was done within the time frame he gave us and was done with the highest standards. My new kitchen looks amazing. His crew was very nice, polite, and worked so hard to get the job done. Guy was always in contact with updates on the remodel and there at anytime to answer any questions I had. His ideas really made a difference in the way the kitchen came together. His knowledge and vision made working with him so easy. The kitchen is now the place where we spend all our time. Couldn't be happier. We plan on doing more work to the house later and I wouldn't call anyone else."
5,"Treeium Inc was hired to replace my problematic flat roof and the job was very well done. We passed both inspections first strike and overall we're very satisfied. So much can be said about a roof job other than it looks good, but definitely plenty can be said about the project manager behind the scene who made it all happen, Erez Shifferman. I've been around for a while to know that Erez is a rarity in the construction industry. His integrity, communication skills and attention to details are something to take pride in, and his company should know about it. Erez brings to the table everything he promises and it is obvious he cares about what he does, how he does it and who he does it for. I'm not sure how many project managers Treeium employes, but if half of them are carved from the same material Erez is carved it is crystal clear to me how Treeium was able to be featured in magazines such Inc 500 and Forbes. It's all about the individuals behind the scene…. All the power to you guys!"
5,"I was looking to have my windows and slider door replaced. I interviewed a few different companies and then met with Treeium's representatives, Rose Chang and Neev Kugel. They were very professional from start to finish. My biggest challenge was finances and Rose and Neev were able to assist me by setting me up with the HERO program. They were extremely honest and explained everything to me before we proceeded forward with our agreement. Throughout the whole process they kept me updated regarding everything that was happening and about to happen. They were onsite to supervise and keep the project on schedule. I was so pleased with the service that I decided to have them do my exterior paint of the house. It was overall a wonderful experience and I would strongly recommend Rose and Neev and the Treeium team for anyone considering with a quality company. Thank you Rose and Neev!!!"
5,"We hired Treeium for partial renovation of our house which included remodeling of the bathrooms, replacement carpet with hardwood floor and porcelain tiles, painting walls, ceiling, windows (inside and outside), doors and some cabinets, and replacement and installation of new fans, lights, switches, circuits, plumbing, and air-conditioner duct covers. One of the challenges was that we did not move our furniture and boxed staff out of the house, and the team kept moving all those around and disassembled and reassembled furniture as it was necessary. We even managed to stay at home for the first two-three weeks of the renovation. In agreement with Treeium, we chose the option to select and buy vanities, air-jet bath tub, faucets, and such materials as floor wood and tiles by ourselves. Shower glass-doors, LED lights, and miscellaneous parts and materials were provided by Treeium. 
Project manager, Lior Lazarovich, leaded the team very professionally, friendly, and flexible. He tried to satisfy all our requests. He was in touch with us on a daily basis, or more often when it was necessary.  In his messages, he updated us every evening. Seeing the high quality of the team work, we asked to add to the project some extra work that we initially did not considered.  Lior explained all our possibilities and helped make the proper choices.  We have never experienced any push from him.  Despite of the additional work, the project was completed in time. The team worked on Saturdays and sometimes on Sundays. We also thank Carlos Escrobar for high quality and optimal solutions.  Thank you, guys, very much!
Half-year later we are still very satisfied with the work done by Treeium.  All neighbors, friends, and other visitors to our house, who had seen the house before the renovation, are usually impressed and comments positively. Some told us that we are lucky to find such a company. All renovated entities still look nice and work properly. The only necessary replacement was a malfunctioned LED light, which Treeium quickly replaced without any charges after my single call to Lior.  We want to thank Lior again for his fine work and customer oriented attitude, and Treeium management for organizing such a good company."
5,"We hired Treeium for whole house renovation. We just bought this old condo, and nothing had been updated at least 15 years. Our project manager was MIKE, he is very responsible, whatever or whenever we needed to talk to him, he responded quickly. Even a little problem, he took care of it immediately. And his team, they're all awesome! They work hard, and make sure everything works and looks great. I honestly some of other contractors might do their work cheaper, but comes to the quality of work, can't beat Treeium. Now our condo came back to life and looks like a new one. Thanks to MIKE and his team!"
5,"Treeium provided & installed beautiful energy efficient windows and a sliding door in our home and we couldn't be happier over all.  Erez Shifferman who worked with us as the manager for the project is an honest, professional and extremely easy to work & communicate with. The service he gave us was superb and we can't imagine being treated any better. I already have a few family members lined up to check out my beautiful new windows and sliding door, so we hope to refer more business to Erez and Treeium in the near future!"
5,"I hired Treeium, Inc to take care of my leaky deck and planters after having water damage due to bad original design and construction of the deck/planters. The project manager who met with me (and later on was responsible for my project) was Erez Shifferman. As opposed to another company that offered a partial fix to remedy the problem, Erez suggested a different approach of redoing the deck entirely to make sure we're not just masking the problem but actually taking care of it from the root. Although the price point was higher than the other company (for the obvious reason that the solution/scope of work suggested by Erez was much more involved), I felt that this would optimally be the better approach for my piece of mind. Overall and throughout the project, Erez kept me involved on a daily basis with pictures and updates and made me feel at ease that I was being taken care of. Erez made sure to keep superb fluent communication with me and I can honestly say that my experience with Treeium as a company and Erez as the project manager who ran my project was flawless, smooth and stress free. It was very noticeable that Erez genuinely went the extra mile for me and you can tell he's just that type of a professional person who would do the same for all of his clients. I was really impressed as well with their headquarters office and operation when I came in to sign the paperwork, you can definitely tell that they're a top notch company that takes great pride in their customer service and quality of work. No more working with shady companies that operate from PO boxes...
I am 100% satisfied with the service and quality of workmanship I was provided with, and would definitely recommend Erez & Treeium to whoever I know who might be in need of any construction service. Thanks guys!"
5,"I hired Treeium Inc. for my much needed energy efficient upgrades around the house which included a complete replacement of my roof and windows. The project manager who worked with me was Erez Shifferman, a true professional, easy going, friendly and caring person whom I knew was going to take care of me and my project from the first time we sat by the table. Sure enough, I was right. My project was ran seamlessly, smoothly and with no glitches whatsoever which is a rarity in the construction world. I can already tell how much of an impact my new roof and windows are having on the temperature and comfort inside my home. Thank you Erez for delivering everything you promised, I will be more than happy to refer you to anyone I know who might be able to benefit from your outstanding service."
5,"Treeium to the rescue!!  I had the BEST Project Manager Lior Lazarovich.  He was patient, kind and very quick to respond to my calls.  Lior and his crew came in to start My Complete Kitchen Remodel on January 9th.  Along with the Kitchen remodel on January 11th Treeium replaced Two Sliding Glass Doors and Three Windows!!!  All these guys were no nonsense take care of business workers.  Everything was done fast, clean & efficient! I was simply amazed at how everything was planned out like clock work (Boom, Boom, Boom).  The organization that Lior maintained with his crew and keeping my sanity in check throughout all this activity was BRILLIANT!!  My finished project was realized on February 8th. My dream has come true!!!  I would definitely call Treeium again for another project without hesitation!!"
5,"We were looking to have a Solar system installed on our home as our electric bills started to escalate drastically over the years. We interviewed a few companies to have this project done including Treeium. Treeium sent out their Solar Specialist, Mr. Neev Kugel, to assess our needs and discuss the effects and benefits of going Solar. Upon meeting Neev, we felt very comfortable with him and immediately noticed that he was far more knowledgeable regarding Solar than any other representative we had met before. He explained everything to us, he let us know ahead of time that we will need to upgrade our main electrical panel as a part of the Solar installation (something that no other representative had mentioned before) and he told us exactly what we should expect throughout each stage of this project. 
Later on, we were even more satisfied and confident in our decision of choosing Treeium and Neev as they found out that we had an open permit with our county for a patio project we took on in the past. The permit was never finalized and had we not met Neev on time, we would have paid a heavy fee to the county for not dealing with this properly. 
Neev assisted us with taking care of this, he took care of the Solar and electrical panel installation, and made sure to visit the project often to make sure everything was done according to his standards. 
It was a really great experience working with Neev and the Treeium team on this project. We were definitely impressed by the professionalism and the integrity that both Treeium and Neev held.
We recommend Treeium to anyone considering a home remodeling project and we strongly recommend that you ask specifically for Neev should the company allow. You won’t regret it. Thank you Neev and Treeium for all that you have done for us."
5,My overall experience with Treeium and Guy Breuer was fantastic. They made me feel at ease with peace of mind though out the duration of the kitchen remodel by letting me know what they were doing or going to do at the end of everyday they were here. I felt very comfortable and trust Guy Breuer and his team with my home when I leave the house to go shopping for Christmas gifts. The kitchen remodel was completed a little over 3 weeks just in time for my birthday on Christmas. I would recommend Treeium and Guy Breuer and his team if you’re considering getting a kitchen remodel.
5,"It was time for us to go through a roof replacement, and being something we never plan to do again, we were very picky in selecting the contractor who will do the job for us. When we met and talked to Erez Shifferman with Treeium, he immediately ""stood out from the crowd"" with his friendly personality, high energy, good vibe and real world professionalism. Erez is a true asset to his company, you could really tell he cares for his customers, loves what he does and takes pride in who he does it for. Erez explained to us in detail the process of replacing our roof, he stood up to his word and provided everything he promised. We certainly had an excellent experience with Treeium as a company and Erez as an individual, and we will definitely recommend him to anyone we know who might need any construction services. A+++ all the way!"
5,My second project with Treeium was exterior painting for my house. It turned out excellent the colors were great. The work on the trim was very precise. Don the project manager was thoroughly professional & always on time. We are very happy with the work.
5,"Treeium did work on my home for my windows, air conditioning and some roof work. The project manager they assigned to me was Avihen Levanon and he was great. Everything was explained thoroughly and my family and I are very satisfied with the finished work. We didn't really have any issues come up which was surprising due to horror stories we've heard with some other remodeling companies. I definitely recommend Treeium to anyone looking to do work on their home"
5,"I was in the market for a complete bathroom remodel and a small bathroom upgrade. I checked out a few companies and after careful consideration decided on Treeium. After meeting with Raz, I was so impressed with his knowledge and professionalism that had no problem in making my decision to have them do the work. The workers have been efficient and have been meeting their deadlines. We're actually ahead of schedule, which makes me very happy. I would definitely recommend their services for any home renovations."
5,"My husband and I wanted to add living space to our living room. I found Treeium on line and read their reviews.  I was impressed with the information. Treeium has it's in-house engineering and architectural department which helped us to obtain the blue print and the permit for the construction.  Our project manager, Don, has communicated through-out the planning process and has done a great job keeping us updated on the progress. I'm very excited to get our project started. 
     Our project is now completed and I can't tell you how wonderful it has turned out to be.  I wanted the wall moved out to give 230 sq. ft. of extra living space.  Everything I envisioned  from the day we started the planning process and by the end of the complete the results were higher than my expectations.  My neighbors have watch the progress and are awaiting to come over to experience the completed addition that has completely change my living room, with a bay window looking out into the patio/back yard.  
       Don, project manger, communicated throughout the entire project on the daily duties, worked closely with his foremen to insure great workmanship, quality assurance and he takes a lot of pictures. I recommend Treeium as a qualified contractor/re-modeler.  Make sure to ask for Don, the big Russian Armenian gentleman.  We love our remodel."
5,"Beyond satisfied with the work Treeium did with our new windows instalation for my home.
They got the work done fast , very friendly and welcoming team.
Erez has an amazing energy, and great personality. He explained to detail the process for us to qualify to get our windows changed. Any question we had , he was able to answer and get us out of dought. I recomend treeium they did an amzing job and are looking out to help home owners improve their homes"
5,"I was looking to upgrade my master bathroom as it was pretty old. I met with a few companies and decided to hire Treeium mainly because of their reputation and the professionalism of the project manager they sent over, Neev Kugel. He was very knowledgeable and managed to discuss everything in detail: scope of work, timelines, pricing, etc. I have never gone through a process like this before and Neev was able to simply break it down in a way that didn’t leave any room for questions. I was extremely impressed by his attention to details and little did I know how this would play a major factor throughout the remodel itself. He was on top of the project at all times and made sure I was always aware of what was going on in my house. When we met, Neev prepared me that this project would take anywhere between three weeks to a month. Imagine my surprise when the whole remodel was done and over with in two and a half weeks! I was so pleasantly surprised that I decided to hire Neev and the Treeium team to also take care of my Kitchen. I met with the Treeium designer and similarly to the bathroom job, the Kitchen was completed in a timely fashion and the end result came out beautiful!
To whomever is reading this review, don’t waste your time by looking anywhere else. I strongly recommend Treeium and specifically Neev Kugel to take care of any of your remodeling needs. They did an amazing job for me and I know that I will hire them again in the future! Thank you Treeium and a special thanks to you Neev for making this process so easy for me and for delivering on everything you had promised!"
5,"We had a great experience with Treeium. We had a larger island built in the kitchen of our new home. They did a great job matching the material to the existing finish and they deliver it within the promised time frame. Erez Shifferman was our project manager. He is very personable guy and understood our needs from day one. Erez work hard to ensure that everything was not less than perfect and always kept us informed about how everything was progressing. The project involved the demolition of our old island, fabrication of a costume island, electrical work, and installation. 
I highly recommend this company and we will definitely be using them for other projects we have in mind."
5,"We had a leak in our 2nd bathroom. I saw that Treeium had great reviews. We reached out to them and we were contacted by one of their Project Managers, Lior Lazarovich. We decided to replace our bathtub with a shower and replaced the toilet, vanity and flooring. We agreed on contract terms and Lior called their tile & flooring partner to make an appointment so that we had access to Treeium pricing. Our entire remodel was seamless from beginning to end. But what made our experience exceptional was having Lior as our Project Manager. He communicated next steps to us on a daily basis. We always knew where we were in the process. Lior also had a Supervisor, Gady onsite to oversee the crew. Gady was also communicating next steps. And if you have never installed a shower, there are many steps. We passed inspection with no issues because Doing things right is a priority for Lior. Lior has great passion for his work and this shines through in everything he does. We are looking forward to remodeling our master bath in the future. Our first call will be to Lior. We highly recommend him & his team! Laurie & Mike from Irvine."
5,I had a smell in my basement and my friends advised me that it may be mold. I went on home advisor and Treeium was the first company that showed up. The representative was Don Mkhitarian. He was very knowledgeable about the field and helped us with a mold test. The test results came back positive. I appreciated the fact that Don communicated with us through out the process and he explained the different types of mold that we had and the health hazard that each were responsible for.  We are very happy to take action with Treeium and looking forward for Don To help us with the remediation process. I recommend Treeium to all home owners.
5,"Was referred to Guy Borenstein by a friend who had a similar project done and was happy with the work. He has been responsive, work began on time and the workers have been clean and prompt. Completely renovating a bathroom from the studs out, so far all has gone as promised and on schedule."
5,"I was looking to increase the energy efficiency of my house as it was poorly insulated. I called a few companies and decided to hire Treeium to conduct an energy audit for me to better understand what I can do to improve my home. Upon receiving the energy audit results, I met with Treeium’s project managers Neev Kugel and Avihen Levanon to go over the scope of work involved with the energy audit results. I was so impressed with their knowledge, demeanor, and the fact that I didn’t feel pressured to do anything, that I decided to go ahead and hire them to do the work for me which included: wall and attic insulation, exterior paint, main electrical panel upgrade and replacing my windows. Neev and Avihen made sure to always keep me posted regarding the project’s progress, they were very quick to handle any issues which came up, and overall were extremely professional and efficient in making sure everything ran like clockwork. I was so impressed with their work that I decided to also hire them to take care of my front yard and install drought tolerant landscape for me, and I must say that it came out BEAUTIFUL!
Thank you Neev and Avihen for your continued care and service throughout this project. It was a pleasure working with you and I would strongly recommend Neev, Avihen and Treeium to whomever is considering going through their next remodel!"
5,Erez Shifferman and the Treeium team have been a pleasure to work with.  Their professionalism and attention to detail make any project easy. We are looking forward to working with Erez again in the near future.
5,"Not realizing that windows would drastically help in our duplex's curb appeal, Erez Shifferman, our project manager suggested we consider the offer after explaining all the benefits of having new energy efficient windows installed. After much deliberation and Erez explaining to us the payment plan, we decided to give it a go. Erez was very attentive every step of the way, from explaining the paperwork to setting up an installation appointment that worked with our schedule. The windows installers were very handy and worked with all the clutter we had at the moment. The installation was swift and they accommodated last minute changes we made with the window plans. We instantly saw the difference and are happy with the work that they did. Would recommend to others, especially Erez our project manager, who after our installation came to make sure the job was well done and finish off any paperwork and any lingering questions we may have had. Thanks Erez!"
5,"Kelley here.
Guy Borenstein Was my contractor . He was recommended by a family member.  I got three estimates in this price range . Guy had the best price , but more he had knowledge and suggestions and facts that the others had not offered ! I felt that it would be a more professional job. The master bath is gorgeous and well constructed . We gutted it and the team with Maya , Lyle , Moses and Micha and the painter are all experts . They took me shopping and it was a group effort . They were patient with my artistic side .Thanks ."
5,"As a homeowner I usually don’t speak to people who knock on my door and offer services, but on that one day a young man, Erez Shifferman, knocked on my door with a smile and said they were working in my neighborhood (which they were). He introduced me to their company and what they were doing. Overall, Erez just made it easy for me to talk to him. I was badly in need of a new roof and decided to give it a try. After reviewing his company’s good history I decided to go with Treeium. 

I felt my service was excellent, the customer service and attention I received from Erez were really second to none. Throughout the project I felt as if I was Erez's only customer and his only running project, but I know I was not! I’m very happy with the service I was given and the new roof I have. I already referred Treeium and Erez to a few acquaintances and I will recommend them to anyone who needs work at their home. The project was efficiently completed on time and the results are excellent. Thank you Erez and Treeium!"
5,"It's a rare thing to find a company that offers top quality workmanship, excellent speed at getting the work done – and competitive pricing. Treeium has delivered on all of the above… and more! Our project manager, Erez Shifferman and his team have worked magic on my 62 year-old, ranch-style home. After initially stressing over the thought of hiring and coordinating 5 or 6 individual contractors for a long overdue remodel/renovation, we met with Erez – who presented my wife and I with an inclusive, energy-efficient plan to replace our cedar shingled roof, old wood windows and original wood siding with all-new eco-friendly products.

Erez was always either available on-site or by cell – and ALWAYS responsive to calls or texts throughout the day or eve (a perpetual fear of mine, after hearing various accounts of contractor-caused renovations-gone-wrong from friends and colleagues) to discuss project scheduling and milestones, or to address any personal concerns. From the demo stage to the final stucco applications, Erez would always check in with his team, then touch base with me with project progress and updates. Throughout the process, as I’m sure many homeowners are guilty of, my wife and I made personal adjustments to our project vision – to which Erez was equally gracious and accommodating. Among the many other favorable impressions made by team Treeium was the punctuality and the positive attitude of the crew – and if you happen to live in the SoCal region, be sure to request the ‘3 Georges’. IMHO, these guys bent over backwards to make our home remodel a pleasurable experience!

Our project is nearly done, the new exterior now looks practically brand new – and I couldn't be happier. Personally, I found Erez's professionalism to be truly extraordinary. He followed through on everything he represented – making sure everything was not just acceptable – but perfectly to my liking. In sum, I would recommend Treeium to anyone who wants their home to shine!"
5,"My wife and were planning on hiring a contractor that would help us with vinyl fence installation for our backyard. We had a few estimates already and wanted to get our third one as recommended. Our third appointment was set with Treeium. Treeium is a nationally ranked full remodeler that has all the licenses necessary to complete any home renovation project and is currently ranked 30th out of the Top 500 qualified remodelers Nationwide and that was the reason we contacted Treeium. We were very Pleased with the Project Manager Don Mkhitarian that came to see us. He was very Knowledgeable about every aspect of the job. He took his time to measure every detail as well as contact the Manager of the Vinyl fence department at Treeium ""Jack"" and review all the details that would be entailed  in the installation process. We thought Don was very Honest and Genuine with us. My wife and I are retired and we had a set budget for the project, but after the meeting with Don, we both realized that the Job entails more than what we thought. We thank Don for his input and Professionalism and we are going to restrategize our budget and hopefully have Don help us with the project at a later time."
5,Guy Kritshtein was our project manager and was terrific!  He was very personable and knowledgeable. Guy was always just a phone call away.  The remodeling of our kitchen and bathroom was completed without problems.  They are a real eco home remodeling company.  I will be using this company again when I redo the backyard.
5,"Five star rating!  My experience working with the Treeium Team, generally, and Project Manager, Eli Gerloy, specifically, was fantastic.  Eli oversaw a complicated kitchen/living area/bathroom remodel project at our home.  Eli provided us with a comprehensive plan and associated quote for the project and ensured that the our budget was maintained, despite a couple of plan modifications along the way.  Eli and his team were all very knowledgeable and responsive.  I highly recommend Treeium and will work with them again down-the-road.  If you choose to do so, ask for Eli - he will take care of you."
5,"Not realizing that windows would drastically help in our duplex's curb appeal, Erez Shifferman, our project manager insisted we consider the offer. After much deliberation and Erez explaining to us the payment plan, we decided to give it a go.

Would recommend to others, especially, Erez, our project manager. Who after our installation, came to make sure the job was well done and finish off any paperwork and any lingering questions we may have had. Thanks Erez!"
5,"I've contracted three projects with Treeium, with Liran Avital as the project manager.  The first and most ambitious was a bathroom renovation.  I did my own design for the bathroom, which ended up being more work for Liran and his crew than he was originally expecting. But even with the increased scope, he stuck to his original bid, and he got the project done within the time estimate.  The project turned out great; the bathroom is beautiful!  And I was really impressed with everone on his crew - just the right mix of professional and friendly, and proud of their craft (especially the guys who did our tile work!)  I'm not going to pretend everything was perfect - there were a few minor delays that could have been avoided, and on one of the smaller projects, a miscommunication about one of the materials used.  But weighing everything, Liran definitely earned a five-star review!"
5,"I interviewed quite a few companies to remodel my bathroom and upgrade my kitchen, when Don and Tomir came to give me a quote I was immediately impressed. From the beginning of the process I felt confident that I had hired the right team and I felt secure with Robert and his guys being in my home when I wasn't able to be there. Don and Tomir were always in contact with me and gave me a schedule so I would always know what was going to happen the next day, or in that week. 
I am very happy with the quality of the work and I know that if I ever have an issue with any of the work that has been done, I can text Don and Tomir and they will take care of me. I appreciate the attention and support I have had the whole project. Most importantly... I love my new bathroom and kitchen!!"
5,"I am very pleased with Treeium. My main contact was Guy Breuer who was very congenial and informative from the beginning. Guy originally set me up with Danny, who became my architect and worked with me to develop the plans for my addition. We added a garage, a bathroom, an extra room, and extended the front room. Danny took care of everything with the county and I only had to go to the county office once. The plans came out just the way I had foreseen. 

The cost was a little more than I wanted to pay but it was well worth it. From foundation to roof and everything in between supplies were top grade and so was the workmanship. I am very grateful for our foreman Angel, he and his crew worked every day, some weeks including Sundays to get my project done. And to top it all he and Guy kept me informed of their progress and what to expect the following week. 

Originally I was told that it would take 3 to 4 months, which was accurate since they finished in a little over 3 months and that was with a few delays caused by the rain.

I have received nothing but compliments from my neighbors and even random people passing by. Thank you Treeium."
5,"We were looking an energy efficient remodel that included air conditioning, new lighting, insulation and window replacement, a new electrical panel and were also considering solar. We turned to Treeium because we needed a contractor that was eligible to work under California's P.A.C.E. program (we went with Ygrene for financing), and could cover the full scope of services. My main points of contact were Neev Kugel and Ofer Dub. I found them to be both very responsive to our needs and schedule and pragmatic in their approach. The scope grew to include a rewire based on needs dictated by living in an old house, though they also recommended to wait for solar before understanding the new energy dynamics post-improvements, which insured the investment was going to the most needed items. Everything was seamless between Treeium and Ygrene. They went the extra mile to make sure we were satisfied with the work. Highly recommended."
5,"I am very pleased with the job Treeium construction and the help of the project manager Liran Avital did on my home.  The project included stone flooring, carpet, all new cabinetry and countertops.  My home looks amazing, because the meticulous work by this company and the expertise of Liran who made recommendations had the project move along quickly and oversaw work as it was being done."
5,From start to finish Treeium has made our visions a reality.. Equipped with highly trained professionals within the home renovation business they provided great service and products.
4,"We had a significant remodel on a house we just bought - some would say it was a ""gut"" job. I don't think a single room remained untouched and we even deliberately moved retaining walls and had to fortify in other areas as a result. Treeium came in very competitively priced and provided some legit references ultimately winning the business. The work done was solid and Ron Admony - who was our project manager - in particular should be singled out. He was on site frequently to supervise the progress, and made himself available practically 24/7 via phone or text. In many cases as addenda popped up he would work with us to keep the spend in line. Definitely ask for Ron on your project when you call them!"
5,"I would like to share my story, about my experience I had with Treeium.

I contacted Treeium to replace my soak in tub with a shower.
I have a medical issue with both of my knees and I am having a difficult time entering my tub. I am a retired veteran and have been doing physical labor throughout my life which causes my knees to ache. 

Guy Borenstein from Treeium came in to give me a bid on the project. Guy listened to my needs and advised me on what my opinion were. Guy's price was more than my budget which I can afford (I have not done any construction work for over a decade, I just couldn't afford it). And was not aware of construction prices in today's market.

I told Guy that I cannot afford to do the work at this time.
I could sence Guy wanted to help in any way he can, and he did smile emoticon

Guy asked if he could step out for a few min to speak to his office.After a few min Guy came in and explained to me about a program were Treeium gives back to the Community and there is a possibility that I could qualify to have my bathroom remodel done at no charge, and YES FREE!


We filled out the application and within a few weeks I found out that Treeum is going to sponsor my poroject and I will be receiving a new bathroom remodel at no charge . I never won anything in my life and can't believe this was happing to me.Within 3-4 weeks my bathroom was completed and it came out better then I ever dreamed of.

I want to thank Treeium and Guy Borenstein for making my life ""change for better""

 Sincerely,
 Allan and Terri Hewett"
5,"I love my new fireplace tile! I found Treeium on Home Advisor and from start to finish the experience was great. These guys are the real deal. I felt very secure that I was dealing with a legitimate company who has been in OC for many years (and who has tons of great reviews!) I love that they have in-house contractors for whatever job you need and don't hire sub-subtractors to get the work done. Both Don (Project Manager) and Robert (Tile Contractor) were amazing. Don kept in touch throughout the project and Robert went above and beyond to make sure the project was perfect. He also kept the workspace clean which was a bonus. Overall, thrilled with the results and LOVE THIS COMPANY! I will definitely call them again for my next project."
5,"A few months ago, my husband and I had Treeium remodel our Master Bathroom. Our Project Manager was Neev Kugel and he was absolutely phenomenal to work with. We couldn't be happier. So recently we decided to do a total remodel on our stairs too, so of course we called Neev at Treeium. Once again, he was excellent to work with. Our stairs were done beautifully and as always the customer service and quality of work were all at the highest level. Just like our Master Bathroom remodel, our Project Manager Neev Kugel was always on top of the project from start to finish. We have received so many compliments on our new stairs. Thank you Treeium, and even more specifically, thank you Neev!"
5,"We are very pleased with our new bathroom! Liran Avital was the project manager and he listened well to our description of what we wanted in the remodel. Each step of the project was carefully planned and carried out, and the finished room meets all our goals and expectations!
Virginia Connell"
4,"My name is James Peery. I hired Treeium for a bathroom remodel. I went on Home Advisors and was given the name of three contractors. The only one who called me was Treeium. 

I was contacted by project manager Don. He showed up on time, was very interested in my needs, and gave me a quote. I found Don to be knowledgeable, polite, and most of all he was not ""pushy"" about me signing with Treeium. Don also made it a point to come by the project weekly to check progress.

I also dealt with Devon who works in client complaints and quality control. I found Devon to be a breath of fresh air who took care of all the issues I wanted addressed. Devon even called me on her day off to keep me up to date on the resolution of my issues. I wasn't having quality issues as much as I was frustrated with the length of the project and some other minor issues. Devon treated all my issues as if they were major and she was always pleasant. 

I also dealt with the field quality control manager. His name is Dror. He was awesome. He listened to my concerns, took pictures, and made sure all the work was done to his standards and mine. Dror was great to work with.

Overall my remodel turned out great. The price didn't change and the work looks awesome. I would recommend Treeium for anyone needing construction work done."
3,Very helpful and always great communication. The project managers were really wonderful and did their best to try and make sure things were as we wanted.
5,"Erez Shifferman, Sam and their Crew at Treeium showed up on time from day one. They are a very professional bunch. They took stress off my shoulders when it came to doing mold remediation in my Master Bathroom. Even though the job was small, they took it VERY seriously because the problem was serious. I really thank them all. His crew members were clean, fast, and they very reliable. I recommend them 100%. Erez was very helpful in explaining the work process. Every time I called or texted, he answered right away. They did an amazing job. Sam took it upon himself to make sure that the mold remediation when smooth and clean. Great job guys!!!"
5,We completed our project on 03-15-2016. Erez Shifferman project manager and his crew did an amazing job on remodeling our master bathroom. They converted a walking shower to a roll in shower and lowered one sink to make these wheelchair accessible. Erez Shifferman was very professional. He keep us informed and he help make this a good experience. we would recommend Treeium to others and have them request Erez Shifferman. It was a pleasure working with him..
5,"I just wanted to commend Treeium for an outstanding job. My husband and I have worked with a couple of different contractors and this is the best experience we have had by far. Our Project Manager, Neev, was so helpful. He was with us every step of the way. We never had to wait long for responses to our questions and he was always solution oriented. If we had a question, he had an answer. If we wanted something addressed, he made it happen. We truly felt like he had our best interest in mind. We never felt pressured, it was about what was best for us and our project. The execution and craftsmanship of our kitchen is beyond our expectations. We would highly recommend Treeium and Neev to anyone! He made the stressful experience of a kitchen renovation pretty pain free."
5,"great general contractor for big jobs, thorough bids submitted promptly. highly recommended. 

their project managers take full ownership of the bidding and supervising process. you can tell the employees have high morale and care deeply about their craftsmanship. 

for our project, they came through with a bid on the bathroom which was fair, but the kitchen was not reasonable. overall, they were 5k over the next lowest bid. Still, id consider hiring Treeium on future projects.. they were very honest and not afraid to put things into writing."
4,"We had a complete kitchen remodel done (changed layout, cabinets, flooring, lighting, etc), along with extra floor replacement in the hallway and family room. After interviewing 3 contractors, Treeium's project manager, Liran Avital, was the only one who really listened to what we wanted as opposed to what is typically done. He proposed options and considerations, and yes we had to make trade offs, but we are so happy with our new kitchen. They were very professional about presenting a visual design and juggling things around so we could make better design choices. The interior designer Michelle was helpful about promoting design strategies and guiding us in our decision making.  Norm, the foreman, was very on top of the progress and keeping us posted; he was always willing to address any of our concerns. The work crews / individuals were friendly, hard working, and clean at the end of every day. Treeium was very accommodating about incorporating things which were slightly out of original scope for no extra cost.  They approached complications with a positive attitude and changed things to satisfy our requirements.    They completed the entire project ahead of schedule . We would hire Treeium again for future remodeling projects."
5,"I just wanted to say, I LOVE the work this company has done!!!! Idan Navon was a helpful Production Manager walked me though the complete process. The workers on the house did a AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL job on the work done!!! They were ALWAYS on time & trusted my judgement on the tile, wood floors & marble counter tops! The workers even helped me pack up the house since I had school & work going on & couldn't do it myself. Treeium is even helping me finish the payments so I can finish paying for the job done. Yes, you will pay a little more for the work, SO WORTH IT FOR THE WAY YOU ARE TREATED!!!! They treat you like family. I would recommend then to ANYBODY who needs renovations!"
5,"We did a complete gut and remodel to our master bath.  We met with Kobi and Amir and hired them to do the job. We received the quality promised at the price promised. No hidden costs during or after. The finished product is just what we wanted, and looks beautiful. I would recommend Treeium for and remodel project you have."
5,"I had such a great experience working with this company. I hired them to install a pretty complicated banister (since the handyman I haired before had already done a lot of damage that needed fixed). The project manager, Guy, was truly fantastic! He walked me through the whole process, was always super responsive and made me feel super comfortable with everything. The contractor came by upon request after hours to answer some questions, and he noticed I was moving in and offered to help out with our move.  The crew worked long hours and late to get the job done before the deadline I needed and it looks incredible and feels super sturdy. I'm so glad I found them and plan to use them to remodel my bathroom next!"
1,"We were referred to Treeium from an online website.  During our initial phone call with them, they were very polite, friendly, and professional.  We told them were were looking to do a home addition.  We had no plans and no permit.  They said they were a full service company, which means, they can do the plans for us, get the permits, and build our project.  Sounds great.  They sent out an email and text to confirm the appointment time.

When their estimator arrived, it turned into a nightmare.  We showed him a rough sketched of what we were looking to do.  He didn't both looking at our sketched and told us since we had no plans, meaning blue prints and construction documents, he can't help us.  When I said we were very clear when we made the appointment, we do not have plans yet and Treeium would have us come up with one should we decide to move forward.  He was not happy with the fact we didn't have a plan, then he just threw out a number between $80k to $1`50k without even looking at what we wanted to do.

When I said, had I known they needed plans before they gave estimates, I would not have had them come out because it was wasting our and his time.  His reply, ""Yes, you are wasting my time.""  Those were his exact words.  After he said that, I sent him on his way.  He was only at our house for five minutes.  

I called Treeium back and informed them what happened.  The lady who answer the phone pulled up our request and she said it clearly stated we had no plans, no permits, and looking for an estimate.  She apologized and offered to send someone else out.  I was so upset at this point, I told her there is no need.

I took the day off from work, the appointment was at 10am on a Wednesday, to meet with them.  I clearly wasted a day of work for a fruitless meeting.  Poor service from their estimator, very rude and extremely unprofessional."
5,"My experience with Treeium and my project manager Ron Admony has been fabulous. I was lucky enough to have stubbled upon Ron and Treeium as they were finishing a remodel in my neighborhood and was so impressed with their work I went over to talk with Ron. He immediately came over to my house and gave me his recommendations for my remodel projects. Not only was I so pleased with his ideas, but also that he took time to come over himself as he said he would that I hired Treeium. They  have continued to offer amazing customer service and quality work.   I have used Treeium for my solar installation, remodeling of  bathrooms, replacing kitchen counters, interior painting, acoustic ceiling removal and electrical work throughout my entire house. Their staff shows up as scheduled, on time and will not leave until the work is completed to your satisfaction.  They all aim to please and will work with you to make sure the end result is what you want.  My project manager, Ron Admony,  is amazing and has become a true friend, always available for any questions or concerns and makes sure that the Treeium staff knows exactly what I am expecting.  I highly recommend Treeium and Ron Admony as your project manager for all your remodel needs, they will make any home project painless."
5,"This is a review if Sam Deen and his crew.  I'm in the middle of a bathroom remodel. I originally contacted Treeium for an estimate to replace a shower in my second bath. From the very start I was very impressed with Sam Deen the project manager. Not only did he arrive on time, he was amicable, yet professional. I need several repairs to my home, so after we walked through the bathroom I asked Sam to provide me with an estimate for the other projects. Not only did he provide me with an itemized estimate that covered everything, he also provided me with individual itemized estimates. Sam and I discussed my budget and agreed to start with remodeling the first bathroom. Never, have I experienced a contractor who listens and understands.  Sam made my best interest his first priority and not how much profit he could make. Sam is reliable, trustworthy and compassionate.  He understands the concerns, financial constraints and yes the anxiety inherent to remodeling. Sam  guided me through design, selecting the tile, fixtures, vanity, etc. He is 100+% dedicated to his customers satisfaction. I have become accustomed too and look forward to Sam's morning call and his. arriving in the morning along with which ever craftsman that is needed for the day.  On the rare occasions he is not present, Sam is on the telephone and/or sending a text message. If, I have any questions or need clarification he's a phone call away. I believe his leadership and presence has helped to the project on schedule. His crew is equally amazing.  They are focused and respectful of your home.  The work area is kept orderly and all traces of materials or debris is completely removed by the end of the day.  Words cannot express how satisfied I am so far.  I am confident  the finished project will be exactly what I expect.  If you're looking for a general contractor I highly recommend you call Treeium and  ask for Sam Deen . You want be disappointed.  I'll update this review when the project has been completed."
5,"I have decided to hire Treeium to do my Kitchen Remodel and I couldn't be happier! About a month ago I met who would later become our project manager, Mr. Neev Kugel, and our experience of working with him has been nothing short of great! His professionalism, experience, and attention to details is what made us decide to move forward with him to begin with, but boy, were we in luck! Neev kept us up-to-dated at all times throughout our project. He made sure all of his workers came on time and completed their job in a timely and professional manner. He went over and beyond to make sure we were happy at any stage of our project, and even included a few extra line items that were not even included in our original agreement. I was hesitant about who I was going to hire to do our project but I am so happy we eventually decided to pick Treeium and I'm delighted to have had the chance to work with our project manager, Neev.

Thank you Treeium for giving us the Kitchen of our dreams and thank you Neev for everything!"
5,"Our new kitchen is almost finished and we've been very impressed with the work of Kobi Farkash and his Treeium team since Day 1! They're organized, clean, communicative and keep to their planned schedule. The quality of the cabinets is excellent. The granite finishing work is fantastic. The onsite work quality has been very good and the workers seem to be proud of their work and like what they're doing. Kobi over-communicates - he texts every evening or morning to remind us what's happening the next day. If we've brought up something to him, his onsite worker knows almost immediately. Kobi has an answer for everything. He is a great problem-solver too - when something didn't quite look right, he came up with several solutions to choose from. We would highly recommend Kobi as your Project Leader!"
4,My bath remodel experience with Treeium was positive.  The crews at all stages of the remodel showed up on time each morning.  There were minor issues that came up but project manager Guy Barnea addressed the issues quickly.  I liked how I was able to order the vanity and tile with the contractor discount.  I received everything I asked for and the result is a bathroom I enjoy!
5,"My name is Pamela Van Horn and I've met Ron Poliker after I've signed a contract with another company. Ron have heard that I signed the contract yet came back after 5 hours to make sure I was not been taken advantage of. He came at 8 pm and reviewed the contract with me and pointed out that there are errors, over sites and over pricing. I contacted the other company and canceled the checks and Ron made sure they will not harass me any more. He gave me a much better price and much broader service. the crew was fast and professional, Ron came in every day and listened to my needs. He had a manage fly in from the head quarters in LA to look after the project. Ron is my guardian Angel!!! 
Thank you very much Ron Poliker!!!!!
Treeium is amazing!!!"
5,"We planned to have our kitchen remodel in late of 2014 with limited budget and had three estimated quotes.  We almost made up our decision with the 2nd contractor and went to his showroom to see and choose the cabinet's door with color & the counter top (our decision already decided before we have the meeting with Ron Admony from Treeium).   Ron Admony ""Project Manager"" from Treeium was the last one that contacted us for the third quotation and had an appointment which we thought we only gave two hours for his presentation as a social manner; but we ended up to pick Ron from Treeium EVEN with highest price of the three quotations.  We are very happy that we picked Ron as our Project Manager, he was consistent to provide his support and helping us to finish the project ahead of the deadline.  As the rule of thumb, everything was not smooth and easy as we were looking for during our remodeling kitchen, there were few obstacles that impacted the progress and may delay the schedule; but Ron Admony was always available either by phone or by coming to contact us regarding of any issues that we encountered when the project started until finished.  He responded to our questions or concerns any time that we had in couple hours or personally came to help us to resolve the issues.  He also provided his inputs to help our decision on color, counter top, and/or anything that will help our remodeling kitchen looks prettier.  His goal is always to make sure his customer satisfaction and happy.  It's really a learning lesson to remodel the kitchen and we're glad that we picked Treeium with Ron Admony as our project manager to work on our project.  The final reward was our beautiful kitchen and our family really enjoyed.  Thanks Ron Admony for great job well done and we're sure to contact you for our next project.  Treeium could be the contractor if you need to pick for any home improvement projects and special Ron Admony will be your Project Manger."
5,"Even if you know what you are doing, any kind of home improvement is potentially very scary.  There are so many things that can go wrong, or unexpected problems that can arise.  So, it has been my experience, to hire a contractor that is a professional & knows what he is doing.  
I am very comfortable & confident in recommending Guy Barnea & Treeium for your home improvement project.
I don't write a lot of reviews, and most are when something goes wrong !!
But in this case, I recognize how important to find a qualified person/company to do contracting work....and want to share with everyone my very positive experience.
His prices are very competitive....(not the cheapest)....but the cheapest price normally gets you the cheapest work....which usually makes it ultimately not the cheapest. And why would you not want the best quality work possible.
Guy's attention to detail, only made me extremely comfortable & confident about my expectations. Everyone from his laborers to supervisors accomplished everything I had asked for and Guy's output only made the ""hurdles"" minimal and made me a very satisfied customer.  
I think the best thing I can say....is if (and when) I have another remodeling project....I now need to make one phone call......which makes this process even better.
Great Work Guy & Treeium............I couldn't be happier !!"
5,"I had my master bathroom done and they did a great job. They are professional and on time with the schedule. They even worked extra hours 
to complete the project. I highly recommended this company"
4,"Great job Treeium! Good customer service Guy Borenstein & Sal. Quality workmanship. Your guys were willing to go the extra mile to make our experience less stressful. They clean up at the end of the day, put furniture back if they had to move them... The project was done 1 week later than scheduled otherwise you would have gotten 5 stars."
5,"We decided to remodel our outdated kitchen and found Treeium on a home improvement website.  After making an appointment Guy Breuer,the project manager,came to discuss our needs and gave us an estimate.  The project entailed a full gut of the kitchen which went very smoothly with a minimal amount of dirt and dust.  Rene, the foreman, and his crew did a very good job of being on time and finishing the project in a reasonable 3.1/2 weeks.  All through the renovation Guy was available to help with the choosing of finishes and design choices.  Though any renovation is stressful the crew from Treeium made the experience a little less so.  We would definitely recommend Treeium."
3,I am in the middle of the project.  Guy Borenstein has been my contact and very helpful and cooperative in the planning process.
5,They replaced the my 24 year old roof that was leaking. With the materials they  use and the cost I am set for next 30 years.
5,"They not only got my kitchen done by Christmas, Kobi and his team were amazing. I will definitely use them again and strongly recommend Treeium."
5,"We just recently completed our first bathroom remodel.  We had received multiple job estimates but chose Treeium because of the excellent presentation by Kobi (who would be the assigned project manager).  He listened to our needs and wishes and gave us clear and concise planning projections.  They met all of the goals and we are so pleased with the outcome.  In fact, we were so pleased that we had them do a complete house re-wire and interior paint job.  The work crews were all extremely professional and took great efforts to accommodate, advise and complete the work within the promised timelines.  The different disciplines were knowledgable with their respective field of expertse.  Kobi visited the site often and ensured excellent communication between the crews.  In one instance there was a minor glitch with an electrical outlet.  Within one hour of our call the PM had an electician out to check it out.  All around outstanding service.  Would use this company again."
5,"Treeium is the BEST!!  We worked with Meir Barzilai and right from the beginning, he was extremely professional, always on time and courteous.  Our project was completed on time and within our budget.  We will always use Treeium for any future projects.  Work with Meir...you won't be disappointed!!"
1,I have been very dissatisfied and frustrated so far with my experience with Treeium. Work started and there were immediately issues after demolition and it took two days to get someone to come out and take a look. Communication has been very poor and they haven't communicated a project plan. I continually have to ask when/if someone is going to come out instead of being kept in the loop. I keep taking time off from work and no one shows up.
5,"I LOVE Trrium.  I built a brand new 3,000 Sq. Foot Luxury Home in Malibu and they installation of Tiles/marble/granite was flawless.  Not a single complaint.  Meir Barzilai and his team are professional, trustworthy and courteous.  The job was completed on time and within our budget.  Meir was at our home daily to oversee and make sure the job was proceeding to his quality and standards.  Extremely hands-on and very focused team with tons of experience, i would highly recommend to anybody!!!"
5,"We recently had our new Laguna Woods home renovated by Treeium.  After an initial rocky start with a person no longer with the company, owner Moty Ginsburg had Ron Admony take over as our Project Manager and he has been excellent to work with, diligent in keeping our project on track and has been completely honest with us in all our dealings. 
 
The project is completed and we are very happy with the results.   We had Treeium add a walk-in shower in one bathroom and make the second into an on-suite master bath.  In addition, they created a laundry closet and opened up the kitchen to allow for a large refrigerator with custom cabinets.  To accomplish this they needed to demolish walls, borrow into the slab for new drainage, create two new walk-in showers and a new master closet.  They installed a beautiful glass bowl vanity and custom linen closet in the master bathroom with glass tiles in the shower and along the back of the vanity.  With Ron at the helm and a very able crew, including Luis, Arturo, Juan and Alex, they were able to get the project to a stage where we could move in on time and then they completed the last stages of the project without delay.  We have received many compliments on how the project turned out and everyone who sees it agrees that Treeium did a great job.  I am attaching photos so you can see the results, however, they do not do it justice.  

We highly recommend Ron Admony and Treeium to do your next project.  Not only will they handle your project with professionalism, they understand how important this is to you and treat you and your property with respect."
5,"Treeium is the best company in la and probably in California !

5,"We hired Treeium to remodel our home which included a completely gutted kitchen, all new electrical rewire, removal of acoustic ceilings, new Travis stone fireplace, refinished hardwood floors,  paint of all walls and a tankless water heater. Itay  guided the process from beginning to end with care and concern that we would be completely satisfied with the job done by each of the contractors. Our dreams of  a small Mediterranean villa were surpassed with the outcome of our beautiful home. We are 150 per cent happy with the work performed by our contractors who were here every single day and the fantastic service from Itay. Our kitchen is going to be the envy of everyone that visits our home. Thank you for making our dreams a reality. Rose and Joe Garcia"
5,"Guy came ready to make our family feel like we don't need any further consultations! 
He was:
Friendly- Called ahead to let us know he was on his way.
Great communicator- IMPORTANT! Listens to every idea and executes it.
Enthusiastic-Really excited to get the job.
Professional-Came with his Badge around his neck w/ ID and License.
Artistic- Visualized something we would have never considered.

So I had researched many different companies to get an estimate on the remodeling process at my mothers home. Going through of course Houzz, HGTV, magazines, remodeling guides, internet, and local ads, Guy made us look no further. 

My family got larger within the year with the birth of our 1 year old son and paying $1,650 for a leased home without utilities, car payments, insurances and daily expenses. We decided to make some changes. To minimize our costs. We plan to remodel the home to make it two private family areas.
My Mother owns a home in a prime location in Atwater Village and it currently has 7 bedrooms, 4 restrooms, 2 kitchens, 1 laundry area, 2 large living rooms and dining rooms and a large front yard and back yard. Not to mention also the garage.  

I had numerous consultations about building UP and making it it a two story home. 
Until, Guy! Once he looked at the place he was so inspired that he actually got me excited after being disappointed with high quotes and bad communication of what we are trying to achieve.
He said the house has a large enough in square footage and that we do NOT need to build up. Mind you; building up you are looking at more time, Money and hard to get permits. (Almost a $2-300,000.00 job which I still have all the past contractors calling and harassing me.) He said that the house is large enough to accommodate two different families with their own private area, entrance etc.. 
He said that it was just not designed right,; It looks like a maze. All we really had to do is rearrange all aspects of the house with a good floor plan, knock down walls, and since pluming is underground  with crawl space that would be the fastest, easiest, and inexpensive solution. HE MADE MY DAY!

Out of so many consultations NOBODY gave me that option. I knew then he wasn't there to just get a job and take my money. 
Anyways he came through a few days later with his virtual 3D designer and she measured the whole house and told me that she will design a likable, livable layout and email it to me with the draft including my furniture. All I had to do is send her photos of my current furniture to incorporate them in the visual display. How awesome. I can edit and change everything to our liking. I am just so excited on the actual construction which I can not review about since we are not there yet. 
So far, So good, But I will definitely update my thoughts throughout the process."
5,"My review is way overdue, it was around this time last year  that I hired Kobi who is one of the greatest project managers I've ever dealt with. I had a fantastic experience with the entire team of Treeium. Today I'm visiting their office to review my electricity bill with them to install solar panels on my house.  Their office is just beautiful; the staff is just amazing and super friendly. It was very nice to actually put a face behind the voice. I would personally like to thank Elizabeth for helping me finance my project at great rates which I can afforded. 

My first project was a kitchen remodel that Kobi, he met all of my expectations and more. He made my dream kitchen a reality.  The cleanup crew was fantastic. I never had to worry about picking up after the contractors when they were finished for the day. 

I have recommended Treeium and Kobi to my friend which hired them as well and is super happy with her project as well. I'm looking forward to installing my solar panels on my house."
5,"I was looking for a company to do my master and main bathroom renovations, but wanted to start out with a smaller project first - stairwell, ceiling refinishing, and painting - to see how well the company managed the project.  I was initially interested in Treeium because I liked the idea that their company was doing their part to be a little more green.  

From the very first meeting with my project manager through to the end of the project, I felt I had all the information about what they could do with my project and how they would go about meeting my ideas.

When we ran into an unexpected structural problem that required additional work before we could move on, my project manager was able to quickly adjust the contract and all the work was still entirely completed on schedule.

Having used a number of different contractors for other big projects in my home, I appreciated most that they took care of the 'little things' to make the whole project look complete.  They removed some fixtures to work through the whole space instead of taking the short cut of just working around the fixtures. They caulked the gaps left from previous work so that it would blend in perfectly with their work.  And, they did some extra finishing on a couple of the walls so that the painting would look even more precise.

I was very pleased with the work Treeium did and the ease of working with them, and am planning my bathroom renovations with them now."
5,"We selected Horizon Construction & Remodeling for our 1954 raised floor home’s main bathroom. We had new electric, plumbing, and more to support a modern bidet toilet, deep soak tub, tile work, custom cabinet, as well as faucets and fixtures in an older and smaller style home. David planed and scheduled the work on time and to costs, which passed all city inspections. Any questions, discrepancies, and requests as our bathroom walls and floors were opened, items installed, or final finish and refinements were promptly addressed to satisfaction. Enna Eskin also followed through on all administrative matters and various communications as the project progressed. A special thanks to the electricians and tile workers that were very professional, educational, skilled, and made value added recommendations for our decision-making. Thanks Horizon Construction !"
5,"This is our second remodel with Horizon construction & remodeling
We remodeled another bathroom last year with them
David our project manager was really good and helpful as always 

If we have anything else to remodel we will definitely call them !"
5,Horizon construction & remodeling did a fabulous job on my bathroom. The work was above excellent. Workers were timely thoughtful  and professional. I would recommend  Horizon to anyone.
5,"I recently remodeled my house and was sorely disappointed.  I was a bit gun shy to try again, but changed my mind after being stuck ay home during the covid lockdown. 


I decided to find a new contractor, and was lucky enough to find Mark Besnos, the owner of Horizon Construction and Remodeling.


Mark was able to make my vision a  reality, which was no small task.  He worked with my designer, Misti Riedel and I and had the patience of a saint.  This time around, it was an enjoyable experience.  


I wake up every morning and walk out into the main living area with a big smile on my face.  Before Mark remodeled, my place was so drab.  

I truly love my house and thank everyone for helping me."
5,"We selected Horizon Construction & remodeling in Fullerton because of their high rated reviews and we felt very comfortable with David Eskin the project manager. we thought he will be a good match since we will need to communicate with him on daily basis for the entire length of our remodel. He helped us design our new kitchen and bathroom and select materials while keeping up to code.
we wanted to achieve clean and simple look, more space on our counters along with timeless design. 
The results exceeded our expectations. We love it!"
5,"This my experience with Horizon Construction and Remodeling,
and why I recommend them.
This is the second time that I have hired a contractor. The first time was a bathroom remodel, and it was a disaster, so I was very apprehensive about hiring another contractor.  We needed to remodel our kitchen, so I had no choice. I did my due diligence and research and called three companies to interview. All three I had no prior knowledge of or experience with. Out of the three bids, there was a high, a medium, and a low.
After talking to them one more time I went with the medium bid company. That company is called Horizon Construction and Remodeling. It turns out I made the right choice. My experience with this company is the complete opposite from my first experience with a contractor. 
My Project Manager was Mark, who did an outstanding job of keeping the project moving quickly efficiently. His crews showed up on time, were professional and did quality work, from plumbing to electrical to framing to painting to cabinets all were done to my satisfaction. If something was not done to my satisfaction (which was rare), I just let Mark know about it and he would send someone to either redo or touch-up the work. Mark would visit the job site frequently.
I feel Mark is honest and has his customer’s best interest at heart. There were a couple of times when he could have charged me extra money for items that came up during the project, but he did not. 
Like any project we had to make some changes along the way, and Mark is very willing to work with you to make sure that you get what you want. Mark will listen to your ideas plus he has many ideas himself. He helped us a lot with our kitchen design.
They started my project Oct. 11, 2001. My wife and I were hoping to have the project done by Christmas. They had it done in 7 weeks in time for Thanksgiving!
The inside staff is led be Enna. They make sure everything is ordered on time. They even arrange for inspections. They are very polite and efficient and responsive.
We are doing our doors and windows next and we going to have Horizon Construction and Design do the work.
I recommend Horizon Construction and Design; I give them a strong 10.

Mark and Diane Kincheloe   
Fountain Valley, CA."
5,"Horizon Construction & Remodeling, did everything they promised. Their man did quality work. They said “it will be done” and it was done as they said.
Our Kitchen & bathroom remodel turned better than we thought. 
Mark helped with the design and selecting all the materials and that was very helpful. 
We would recommend them to anyone."
5,I completely renovation my 1 bedroom condo in the City of Fullerton.  Everything was removed from flooring walls kitchen bathroom  walk in  closet. The outcome was outstanding. I couldn't believe how great everyting. Turnedd out.. Every time I come home it's like walking into a model home.. I enjoy Everything and my favorite place is kitchen and patio BBQing and watching sports on my new patio TV.
5,"It was a pleasure working with Horizon Construction and Remodeling, on the complete renovation of my kitchen. David and Enna were extremely knowledgable and professional.  The crew were also very polite, friendly and considerate in the care of cleaning up the worksite everyday, and making sure I was happy with the work done each day.  I will definitely use Horizon on my next project, and highly recommend them.  Thank you to everyone who made our dream kitchen possible.
 
Jeanne and Gary Poggensee"
5,"We recently just finished a remodel of two bathrooms using Horizon for the project. They were easy to work with and worked hard to accommodate a house with four people working from home. Working with their design team, installers, and trades people, the entire project came together without issue. They even helped us by doing some things out of order to ease the burden of a family of four using just one working bathroom.  But the real payoff was in the end product. For that a picture is worth a 1000 words. We are so pleased with our new bathrooms! Thank you to the team at Horizon!"
5,"Such a pleasure to work with Mark and the entire staff at Horizon Construction. Not only did they remodel our entire house filled with furniture during a pandemic, but we did the whole process from out of town. Mark and his staff kept us constantly up to date via Zoom, phone calls, and loads of texts and emails. And the best part is the house turned out better than expected! They made sure the work was done exactly the way we planned and to our expectations, which included guaranteeing anything that went wrong. Mark was a big help in the design process which included helpful advise on where we should spend money and where we could cut corners. He also had little things done along the way, some that he didn't charge us for but that were necessary to make the house look more finished. Lastly, they took great care in making sure the furniture and home decor were protected and covered during the whole process, and whatever was moved was put back where they found it.  We are so grateful for the hard work, service, and patience that went into making our house look beautifully updated!"
5,"So happy to have gone with Horizon Construction for our major kitchen, and 2 bath, remodel project.! From the first meeting with Mark, the owner, I felt that he was trustworthy, knowledgeable and fair. He, and the Horizon Construction crews, did not disappoint. Communication with Mark, Enna, and the office staff were admirable. Mark's design expertise was very helpful. He met all of our wants & needs. Our kitchen was taken from a poorly designed eyesore to a beautiful space. We had major structural work, removal of load bearing beams and steel moment frame, installing three steel beams at the ceiling to create an open floor plan. We completely changed the footprint of the kitchen. Custom cabinets turned out beautifully! The materials purchased through Horizon Design were of high quality and sourced in a timely manner. Workers were friendly, arrived on time and cleaned up at the end of each day. We were so pleased with the kitchen that we added on two bath remodels which were completed along with the kitchen. Thank you Horizon for delivering a quality space which we are happy to invite our friends & family to. We will enjoy the beautiful kitchen & bathrooms for many years to come!"
5,"Horizon construction & Remodeling remodeled/updated both my master and the main bathrooms, which were in their original mid-60s construction state.  David Eskin and his team of tradesmen helped bring my vision to fruition.  As with any project, once the walls were opened up, some revisions were required; based upon their expertise and experience, Horizon was able to provide a few suggestions and a few “tweaks” to address these revisions.  I couldn’t be happier with the results! Both bathrooms are much more functional and beautiful!
Horizon also did some minor improvements in my laundry area – again improving the functionality and looks!
Note: Remodeling costs did not cover much of the material costs.  I had already selected and/or purchased some of the building materials; I did research and purchase much of the remaining materials (tub, vanities, tiles). Horizon does have its own showroom, and could have provided these at an additional cost.  However, because I already had a firm idea as to what I wanted, I handled the ordering of these myself."
5,"Our kitchen was remodeled by Mark Besnos and Enna at Horizon Construction and Remodeling. We chose them after seeing all the great reviews on the Houzz app. When we walked into their showroom, we were warmly greeted by Diana who made us feel very comfortable.  Their product display made it easy for us to put our ideas together. Mark’s crew did a wonderful job.  Kudos to his crew, they really worked hard. Joel Chavez was a standout carpenter/jack of all trades doing much of the major work and tying together any imperfections and any loose ends that arose with a great attitude, expertise, and skill. He’s quite an asset to Horizon.  Antonio Garcia who did our fabulous backsplash and Tom Tzur was the electrician.  Mark ensured that each phase of the project was done correctly and completed on time (about 8 weeks). We gutted and replaced our 80’s kitchen (10’ by 10’) including the small dining area. We kept the same layout but switched the positions of the sink, stove and refrigerator.  Enna helped with all the communication and paperwork and scheduling of the inspections, payments etc.  Thanks to Mark, Enna, and their crew, we have a beautiful modern kitchen with two toned white and blue cabinets.  
Lessons Learned:
1.Stick to your budget and have extra funds for unforeseen things because for sure there will always be something that will come up.  Understand what is and is not included in your contract.  Don’t just assume that everything is included.
2.Be flexible with your time. There is a general outline of what jobs will be done in order mostly during the weekdays but things may change with short notice.  
3.Check that your materials/colors are in stock before you sign your contract. Due to the Covid and political environment, some materials may take longer to get or not at all.  Some newer colors may cost more.
4.Look at your cabinet colors in every light.  We first looked at an espresso-colored cabinet that looked like black in shade and looked light cherry colored under the full sun. 
5.Know what crown molding you want for the top of your cabinets…having pictures will help.
6.Ask Mark if you are not sure of any detail or work that has to be done. Do not wing it…else any fixes may cost you extra. 
7.For lighting such as chandeliers, measure everything. Use you tube to learn to measure your lighting fixtures.
8.Certain changes such as electrical, structural will require city permits and inspections.  Your city’s inspector’s availability will cause delays up to one week. 
9.Choose your grout color for the backsplash…apparently there’s a ton of them (we were looking at different shades of grey because white is too hard to clean). 
10.Choose your door and doorknobs ahead of time. Check to make sure it works including deadbolt after it’s been installed.
11.Choose your baseboard style and size.
12.Choose your light dimmers switches."
5,"After shopping several companies, we chose Horizon Construction and Remodeling for our home improvement project, which was to enlarge and update our kitchen and main bathroom.  In addition, we converted all of our flooring to vinyl.
We are extremely happy with the service, responsiveness, dependability, and the results Horizon provided.  David Eskin was our project manager.  David became a consultant and friend during the process.  He proved to be patient and honest when we encountered an issue with the granite installation for our kitchen.  We upgraded our material to a beautiful and unique Brazilian granite for our kitchen counter.  Our initial granite slab cracked 3 feet across the width of the counter 2 days after installation.  David and his crew reviewed the issue and, without hesitation or argument, removed the cracked granite and replaced it with a new slab at their cost.  Although this experience was extremely stressful for all, the integrity displayed by David and Horizon was stellar and unique in the construction industry.  Contractors are easy to find, but an honest and dependable one is rare in our opinion.  On this experience alone, we would recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling without reservation.  They made it right.
All construction is stressful and we lived in our house during the remodel.  This project was our first in this home, but our fourth major reconstruction in our 45 years of marriage.  Horizon was by far the best remodel experience!"
5,"We were referred to Horizon Construction and Remodeling from my sister's coworker at Houzz for a full kitchen remodel. Our consultation went wonderfully and we felt very comfortable with David. He did a great job explaining their company and the process for our kitchen remodel. He was able to take all of our ideas for the kitchen and make them a reality. He was honest and helpful throughout the whole process and we did not have to stress about all the things you hear other people having to go through during a remodel. He was quick to respond to any emails, calls or texts. The only thing I wish we would have received without asking for was a weekly schedule on what was happening each day and who we would be expecting at the house and what time so we could plan ahead as full time working parents. Overall we were very happy with every contractor who worked on the kitchen! We do not have one complaint about any of the people that came into our house throughout the remodel. We would highly recommend Horizon to our families and friends for any future remodeling and would us them again in the future. We feel that we now have our dream kitchen thanks to the team at Horizon Construction and Remodeling."
5,"We had a fairly large, relatively unused laundry room and a guest bedroom without an attached guest bathroom.  After hunting for a contractor I met Michael who was really friendly, had a clear cut understanding of what I was looking to do without much back and forth, and gave me a break down quote for each aspect of the project in a fast and timely fashion. We converted our downstairs bedroom into a mini master suite with an attached bathroom, French doors where a window once was, and sound proofing of the walls to prevent noise from our flat screen in the family room that shares a wall. We then made a smaller laundry nook. Albeit a few scheduling communication errors, everything was done with care and what I really liked was how Michael would come and look at things and notice stuff that I didn't even see and get them fixed and or corrected on his routine walk throughs. Additionally, the workers that would come to the house never made me feel uncomfortable or worried."
5,"We recently remodeled our Master bathroom and chose Horizon Construction & Remodeling in Fullerton to do the job.  Overall, we had a great experience! We were given a fair price for our remodel and the quality of work was excellent.  Everyone we worked with was polite, courteous and professional.  Any minor issues that came up were addressed promptly and correctly.  Our bathroom looks a million times better is a lot more functional.  Bravo to David, our General Contractor, and his crew!  We would definitely recommend Horizon Construction & Remodeling to anyone and we plan to use them again for our next remodeling project.

5,"When you realize you need work done by a contractor, a lot of apprehension may go through your mind.  But those fears and doubts will be washed away if you choose to work with Horizon Construction & Remodeling in Fullerton, CA 92832.   We dealt mostly with David and from our first meeting we had a good feeling about working with him and Horizon.   David really listened to our ideas and gave us a few of his own which we never would have thought about.   While we wanted to do a few small projects as well (painting all rooms in our house with new flooring, lighting and baseboards), our “big” decision was to remodel our kitchen.    This was a complete gut down to the bare bones of the room then build it back up.  Throughout the entire process David made frequent visits to check on progress, answer questions, and if something needed to be looked into, he was on it right away.  His team always came as scheduled, and we were always looped in every step of the way.   David’s timeline for completion was right on target as well.   It helps that we too were always ready with whatever we needed to provide such as ordering and delivery of our new kitchen appliances, picking lighting fixtures and paint colors and coming to the show room to pick out our flooring, cabinetry, countertops and back splash.  And by the way, their showroom has a large array of options to choose from.  We even had a few last-minute thoughts of having the facing of our fireplace redone and adding some extra lighting in the home to which David accommodated easily.  Even with a few snags due to Covid 19 whereas the countertop and backsplash we picked (which had been on order for months) was suddenly unavailable, his team was on it and helped us pick back up options, to which we found we loved more than our original choices.   In the office, we also worked at times with Maria and Enna, both of whom were pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful to us.    David’s team was courteous and respectful and followed safety protocols like wearing masks.   Since we worked from home, it was easy to practice distancing since we were all in different rooms.  And if the workers needed to speak to us, everyone wore masks and stood apart out of courtesy.    We were overwhelmed with how beautiful the kitchen turned out and were just as pleased with how refreshed and updated our whole interior looks now.   We would highly recommend working with the team at Horizon because this experience helped us rest those apprehensions I spoke of in the beginning.   And we achieved what we wanted in that now when you walk in our kitchen, you just say “WOW.”  Thank you."
4,"We had our completely remodeled, removed a load-bearing wall to open up the kitchen to the den. We also did a full remodel on our small master bathroom to create a big master bath with a small walk-in closet which we did not have before. Also our laundry room was moved to the hallway along with some change orders along the way. We are very happy with the end result and we are enjoying our new home."
5,"Excellent results! What was once a dirty, moldy, ugly bathroom now looks like a spa bathroom in a Vegas hotel; I’m still amazed at the transformation even now that it’s been operational for a while. 

David was very responsive to texts, and always followed up to be sure things were going well, and even when I wanted a big, heavy mirrored medicine cabinet against his recommendation, he graciously had the backsplash tiles adjusted so the back wall could be rewired, then hung the mirror and now it looks great. At least I think it does.

I wanted a particular finish on the cabinets, but he advised to go much darker, which was counter(get it?)intuitive to me, but he was absolutely right, and the dark cabinets contrast perfectly with the earth-tones and creams throughout the rest of the bathroom; I’m glad for his recommendation as it maintains the warm design while providing an elegant touch. 

I can be a difficult client, but David was gracious throughout, and his subcontractors all did a great job and were very pleasant. I also appreciate that while it wasn’t the biggest project, just a smallish bathroom, he gave it his all and treated it like a project of any size; I was actually rejected by a couple of contractors because the project wasn’t ‘big enough’ but David and Horizon gave it their all. I can’t be happier with the end result - the transformation is nothing short of remarkable."
5,"David Eskin with Horizon Construction and Remodeling did a great job coordinating the remodel. All the trades did an excellent job. Any issues were responded to and fixed immediately. We are very happy with the finished product, and will use them again in the future."
5,"We are happy to see the remodeling is completed.  I am satisfied with the materials chosen and the suggestions made throughout the process.  Alicia and Mark Besnos collaborated in choosing the design materials.  We look forward to many years of our new bathrooms.   
Thank you Horizon Construction & Remodeling for the remodels.

Brian and Alicia Dolan"
5,"I had an excellent experience with David from Horizon Construction on an exterior project recently completely and would recommend them highly for any project internal or external.

David was extremely professional throughout the entire process.  From the initial call and consultation we tossed ideas back and forth, his vision was exactly what I was looking for.  He promptly sent images of ideas and websites for me to review and even though we didn't exactly meet at times he was flexible to accept my idea and in the end we came up with something I am very proud of!    To be honest...there where issues, but not with him!   He came through and directed his team to fix not only things I found, but even things that did not fit his image of perfection....he never flinched, his quality was excellent and did not let his team fall behind!   Again, I am extremely happy with the service, vision and final product and would recommend them anytime you have a project you want perfection."
5,"Having chosen Horizon Construction & Remodeling for our project was the best decision we could have made.  The Project Manager, Eitan Beznos made sure that we were completely satisfied 

every step of the way making sure that all of our concerns were addressed.  He was very pleasant and easy to communicate with.  The completed job looks amazing, we could not be 

more satisfied and, we get many compliments from strangers that walk or drive by.  A big kudos to all those involved in the project and we will most definitely recommend Horizon to 

our friends, neighbors and family.

5,"The upstairs bath had been partially remodeled prior to purchasing my condo 5 years ago. It had an updated vanity and lavatory, but the tub and shower combination were the original fiberglass builder-grade enclosure and definitely showed its age of 30 plus years. I wanted this bathroom to look as good as the rest of my home with a new tub, new tile, and new flooring.
Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc. expertly gave me exactly the bath I desired. Horizon’s showroom had ample samples of tiles and I was easily able to select the bath/shower wall tile and flooring that unified my vision. I did not have to wait long for the job to commence and all work was done as quickly as I could have hoped. The only delays were due to unavoidable waiting for inspections and a holiday that delayed one inspection. For those tasks that did not require an inspection to proceed, the trade contractor would show up the following morning. I was able to have my walls retextured and painted, a new overhead light added above the bath/shower, replace the medicine cabinet, and a new exhaust fan and all fixtures installed for the completed beautifully finished bathroom.
My project manager David Eskin coordinated each trade and supplies wonderfully. All of the contractors selected for my project were very professional and I appreciate how quickly and well each performed their trade work. I am delighted with workmanship and the end results."
4,"We had a kitchen and powder room remodel Aug- Oct 2020. We love the final product! It is pretty much exactly what We envisioned. The project finished in a timely manner, and his guys did a phenomenal job; especially tile (Fernando) and cabinets (sorry I don’t remember everyone’s name). Mark was knowledgeable and answered our questions promptly. He was good at showing up frequently and reviewing all the work. 

My only suggestion for improvement would be giving a more accurate estimate, and notifying the owners of the cost of any changes prior to the work being done. The project ended up quite a bit more than anticipated. However, we are happy with the result, and would recommend Horizon to others."
5,"We had our kitchen entirely re-done by Horizon Construction & Remodeling. Horizon replaced our cabinets, sink, inserted a backsplash, rewired our receptacles to meet current code and repainted the walls. They also installed recessed lighting under the cabinets which really brings out the ambiance of the kitchen overall. It was a complex operation and they project-managed it flawlessly. They took a lot of time to truly understand what we wanted and then provided examples and expertise to help guide us to our final decisions. We could not recommend them more for anyone looking to remodel their kitchen."
5,"On behalf of my husband and myself, we highly recommend Horizon Construction for your home projects. This recommendation letter is long overdue. We hired Horizon Construction Inc. in the summer of 2019 to gut and remodel a master bedroom bath and install a sliding glass door. Michael the construction manager was very transparent with us about the timeline and the steps and costs. Everything was done exactly as he said.

To begin with the contract manager Michael was an utmost professional. We told him what we wanted and he gave us a reasonable estimate that closely matched our own estimated costs. As recommended before committing to hiring a contractor we requested 2 other estimates, one came in ridiculously higher than Horizon and one quite a bit lower than Horizon, but we went with Horizon because of Michael’s evident knowledge and on spot recommendations. The meeting with the other contractors didn’t leave my husband or I with the same confidence in amount of knowledge of process and esthetic know how. In the long run Michael’s trained eye for function and aesthetic helped us come up with a design that we are extremely happy with.

Their entire crew was extremely knowledgeable and efficient. We were extremely pleased with their attention to detail and craftsmanship."
5,"We did our master bath remodeling this year and we chose Horizon construction for the second time. Mark the owner, as usual, came up with the perfect design for our relatively small space. The design let us include a big shower, closed bathroom area and lots of closets. Something I did not think we could accomplished at first.
The construction went fast considering the City closure for Covid19. They did a fantastic job and kept everything clean during the construction.
We now have a very beautiful Master Bath we enjoy every day. I recommend Horizon Construction for any remodeling you need. They are very good at what they do"
5,"Professional work done by professional workers in a professional way. We highly recommend Horizon for any home improvement or repair that you might do. Last year Horizon repaired the stucco, wood trim and painted our house. The paint started to peel on part of the trim and they promptly repaired it at no charge. We are also happy with the patio cover they did for us last year.   Steve an Toni G"
5,"Our wrought iron fence was on its last leg, already rotted through.  We wanted a short block wall topped by a vinyl fence. I found Horizon Construction on a couple of the “help” websites and called them. Eitan Beznos came out, discussed the job and provided an estimate. We came to an agreement and they started the next week. The block wall went fast, they finished the 2’ H x 60’ L wall in one day. It is on top of a steep 60’ tall hill.  The job was completed in a timely manner.  All along, Eitan kept me aware of progress and status.  He came out to inspect the job. At the end, Eitan and the company owner/manager came out and inspected the job to make sure we were satisfied.  We could not have been anymore satisfied with the work, the timeliness, and the cleanup efforts. Horizon finished the job on the originally forecast completion date.  I would recommend Horizon and Eitan Beznos for any construction or re-modeling efforts you might have.

5,"We got bids from 5 different contractors for the construction we needed in our backyard. We were converting our garage into an additional dwelling unit (ADU), which has very specific requirements in most cities. David Eskin came out from Horizon; they were the last bid we received. All the bids came in just about the same ballpark, but we chose Horizon because David seemed very upfront and personable at our first meeting. He took the time to address our questions and concerns; all of them, even if we didn’t particularly want to hear the answers. We trusted him. We live in a historical home, so there were many rules we needed to follow and styles we needed to match exactly. David, his crew and Horizon did that perfectly. We ran into some problems because our house is old. They couldn’t have been foreseen because nobody knew what was under our garage. Those problems were frustrating and added expense to our project, but David and Enna at the office helped us through those as well. The interior turned out so much better than we imagined it would! It’s just beautiful. We would recommend Horizon to anyone needing to get any work done in or around their home. Awesome company!!"
5,"Eitan Beznos of Horizon Construction did a major Remodeling on my kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms and garage. This included:
New patio slab.
Removal of wall and load bearing 4x4's.
Kitchen island.
Fireplace.
New roof.
New ceiling.
Complete rewire of house and garage. 
Power panel upgrade and electric car charger in garage.
Paint interior and exterior.

Eitan was the project manager. He was easy to work with and there was good communication with Eitan and the office staff. The process was clearly written down and all questions were answered.

I did not know exactly what I wanted and Eitan made useful suggestions. He designed the layouts and helped me select materials for the floor, ceiling, kitchen counters and bathrooms.

Eitan pulled permits and all of the inspections were passed.
There were often several teams of workers in the house at the same time. Eitan coordinated the work to insure that the progress was efficient and that different groups did not get into each others way.

When problems came up Eitan dealt with them. Termite damage was discovered and had to be addressed before a bathroom could be completed.
Building codes required that work had to stop when old flooring was removed by a hazmat company.

While I thought that the quotes were high, what I got were clear goals, quality of work, management of workers, problem resolving and the overall progress of the project.

I was very satisfied with the end result. The open floor plan between kitchen and family room and the removal of cupboards in the hallway, makes the house look very expansive. The transformation was stunning.

I would recommend Eitan for home remodeling.

5,"I had the bathtub removed from the master bath and a shower with a steam unit installed. David Eskin was the project manager and was a pleasure to work with. Despite the current pandemic situation, David kept the project going. The workers were amazing, each one an expert in their respective craft. The job was finished beautifully and I’m very happy with the results. I would highly recommend Horizon Construction for any remodeling job."
5,"If you're shopping contractors, and want to avoid a nightmare, read this. Licensed contractors are not all the same. Horizon Construction & Remodeling gets 5 stars. This company delivered what was promised. I'm not affiliated with Horizon in any capacity. I'm a customer, who hired them to remodel my bathroom after calling 5 other contractors, who either didn't show up, or quoted ridiculous bids. Mark, who owns the company with his wife, Enna, gave me a quote that was right about middle range. He paid attention to my vision, and when I asked  his opinion, he had great ideas, but was never forceful. He was also right up front about everything—nothing hidden. After I decided to sign the contract, I was still somewhat skeptical. Bathrooms and kitchens are multi-phase projects, and things can go south quickly. I'd already heard all the nightmares about hiring the wrong contractor. By day 2, I noticed that Mark, also my project manager, stayed on top of every detail, so I stopped stressing. All the crews he sent for each phase were skilled, knowledgable, and cleaned up afterwards. I got the impression this company only uses competent crews, who produce quality workmanship. No problems communicating, either. Mark was always available. Another thing: he's organized, and kept the project moving forward. The staff appeared to be organized, as well. I'm thrilled with the appearance and function of my new bathroom—it's gorgeous. It turned out much better than I had expected.  If I have another remodel project in the future, I won't hesitate to hire them again. Thank you so much, Mark, Enna, Grace, Anna, Maria and staff!"
4,"We had a great experience with David Eskin on the remodel of our kitchen and floors in 2019. Work was completed on time and his workers were outstanding.  Four months after completion there was a problem with the grout cracking along the kitchen counter and David promptly sent his tile guy out to re-do the cracking grout.  Now, four months later, the problem occurred again. David promptly responded again and this time they used a flexible material that matched the grout perfectly.  In my experience Horizon Construction stands by their work and has responded quickly to my concerns even after the project was completed."
5,"I hired Mark Besnos and Enna of Horizon Construction and Remodeling in the spring of 2019 to do a complete kitchen remodel which included removing a load bearing wall and removing a gas fireplace.  The actual construction began with the demolition in mid-July and the job was completed the last week of October. I had a great experience overall despite the usual stresses of a home remodeling project (and living in the house during construction). Mark listened to my ideas and concerns and he helped me bring the beach cottage home of my dreams to fruition. He was very knowledgeable and gave me great advice on every aspect of the project. Mark and Enna invited me to their showroom in Fullerton and showed me a wide variety of materials (flooring, tile, Quartz, cabinetry, etc.) to choose from.  I appreciated Mark’s attention to detail, thorough explanation of our contract, extensive resources, and consistent open communication. Mark was the project manager for my remodel and he was onsite regularly to oversee his crew. I always felt as though my project was Mark and Enna’s top priority. Any time I had a question or concern, Mark and/or Enna, promptly took my call or immediately called me back. Mark was committed to keeping the project on schedule as much as possible, even when unforeseen delays occurred due to materials being held up. He always had a plan B to keep things moving. All of his crew members were very reliable, courteous, and dedicated. Many of his crew members even came to my house on weekends. I am extremely happy with my new, improved, expansive kitchen, living, and dining room. I absolutely love it! A huge Thank You to Mark, Enna, the incredible office staff (Genesis and Vanessa) and to all of the skilled craftsmen at Horizon for creating a beautiful home for my family!"
5,"Horizon construction and Remodeling did a major kitchen remodel for us including removal of walls, fireplace, and reconstruct a large portion of our ceiling.  They literally transformed our kitchen!  
After checking out many others, we decided to choose Horizon Construction and Remodeling because of all the great reviews.  After meeting the staff, our project manager David Eskin and reading all the positive reviews we knew we made the right decision.  The staff is wonderful.  Very caring, respectful and honest.  Our kitchen turned out  beautiful.  We are very happy with the outcome!

Demolition was right on schedule and the crew was excellent, very fast and left the job neat at the end of the day. We did however encounter a set back which caused a long pause after demolition.  This lengthened the job quite a bit and added additional expense and inconvenience (we feel) could have been avoided with a more through inspection (pre-demo). 
All the staff at Horizon are great to work with.  David our project manager is terrific.  He is easy to work with and very helpful.  He provided suggestions that were very helpful and added to the beauty of our job.  There were times he could have lost his patience because of my indecisiveness but never once did!  He’s a true gentleman.
Caesar our cabinet maker is a master at his trade.  We love his work and are so pleased with our cabinets!
Something notable that you may not find in many other constructions companies.  With Horizon, once the project ends, they treat you with the same kindness as the day you signed the contract.  

This company shines in Customer satisfaction!"
5,"We recently had our 2500 square foot home remodeled by Horizon Construction & Remodel, which included the kitchen, master bath, flooring, lighting, paint, fireplaces, millwork, plumbing and tile.  We contacted a total of four general contractors, all of whom were within the same approximate price range, however, after meeting with Mike Roppo, we decided to sign a contract with Horizon and we’re glad we did!  Mike was our Project Manager and he did an excellent job overseeing and managing the entire project from start to finish.  He is professional, knowledgeable, personable and made sure that everything was done right!  He was quick to respond to phone calls, texts, and emails and came by to check the work often.  We are retired so we were able monitor the work as it was being completed.  At times issues would arise, but whenever we expressed a concern, Mike was prompt to resolve it, making sure that all work was done to our complete satisfaction and that no corners were cut.  All of the contractors that worked in our home were very experienced and good at what they did!  We were especially impressed with Hector who painted the entire inside of the house, and Victor who did all of the tile and marble work in the master bath, kitchen, and fireplaces.  Also Ulyses (plumbing), Hugo (flooring), Caesar (countertops), and Tomar (electrician), were all excellent at their crafts.   The process of remodeling our entire home took five months and everything turned our beautiful!  Horizon Construction & Remodel is an excellent company that stands behind their work and prides themselves in customer satisfaction!"

I will recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling for any of your projects"
5,"Our goal was to remodel the kitchen, guest bathroom, and flooring of our home. This is the very first time my wife and I have ever took on a major remodel project. It was important to have a contractor that was honest , responsive, and did quality work within our budget. Since my wife and I work and are extremely busy with our kids, it was also important that we have project manager that would communicate with us and closely monitor the people working on our home regarding quality. We met with Eitan, project manager for Horizon Construction  and he took the time to understand that these qualities were important to us. He was also very honest about the project and did not overpromise just to earn our business. Eitan and his company made sure we knew they wanted to do what’s best for us and immediately we felt confident Horizon was fit for the job. His crews were very professional and would answer our questions and always cleaned up when they left for the day. Of course there were some hiccups during the project such as the fridge not fitting in the space and some kitchen cabinets needing to be moved around and adjusted. In the end, the things we requested got fixed and Eitan made sure we were happy. I would recommend Horizon to those that see the value of a project manager. Overall, the quality was good for our budget and I would rate Horizon a 4.7 out of 5."
5,"I has Horizon Construction & Remodeling out to do a bid to remodel a guest and master bathroom because of their high rating on Angie’s list.  An appointment was made and David Eskin showed up right on time.  He gave me a detailed bid right on the spot in writing.  Horizon did each bathroom separately so I could always have a usable shower.  I had already picked out most finishes before I got bids.  However, after the backsplash I had picked out was installed, I hated it.  David was great and said they would re-do it no problem with whatever alternative tile I picked.  There were some issues throughout the process that came up but I really appreciated that David and his subcontractors always came up with a solution.  The final products are beautiful.  Now I have 2 spa-like bathrooms with modern finishes that I’m thrilled to show off."
5,"We contracted Horizon Remodeling to remodel our fireplace and paint our kitchen, family room, living room and hallway.  Eitan Beznos managed the project and was extremely conscientious making sure all work was done correctly and completed as promised.  He met with us frequently to check progress and make sure work was done to our satisfaction.  When we asked for additional electrical work, he arranged for an excellent electrician named Tomer who did a fantastic job for us,
We would recommend Horizon Remodeling.  Work was well done and finished earlier than promised."
5,"Horizon completed a 450 square foot addition on our house that included moving an exterior wall and reworking the roof line to add a bathroom and expand three bedrooms.  This project took place from July 2019 to November 2019.  Our primary criteria for selecting a construction company was familiarity with working with our city, timeliness, and quality of work  performed.

We are very happy with the final product of this project.  The finished work provided by Horizon Construction is beautiful and works well within our high end home. The craftsmen used for the detail work were top notch, and the projects that needed to match existing finishes in the house look nearly flawless in their integration.  We did not have any problems with permitting the plans or with passing the inspections with the city so there were no hold ups time wise because of inspection issues.

When any hiccups did occur, as they occur in any remodel or home project, Horizon was very quick to correct them to the best of their ability or propose solutions that would result in the same high end product we were looking for.  The customer service provided was quite good.

David is a great project manager and was very attentive. He made sure any and all concerns were addressed promptly and that questions were answered in a very timely manner.  He was great about working with me in regards to our timeline and making the process of living through the project as painless as possible.

In short, I am quite happy that we chose Horizon Construction for our addition project and would absolutely recommend them."
5,"I decided to do a complete bathroom remodel, and after meeting with several contractors, I decided on Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc.. I am very happy with my overall experience. My bathrooms look absolutely beautiful. Horizon gutted both bathrooms and replaced everything with new white porcelain tile, sparkling mosaic panels and backsplash, sturdy glass doors, chrome trims, and all new fixtures. They painted both bathrooms light grey with white trims, and replaced the laminate floors with light grey toned tile. I love the results and I am glad I decided to do business with Horizon.

I also had a great experience with Horizon’s customer service. They provide excellent service. Everyone I spoke with (demolition crew, plumber, office staff, contractor, owner) was professional, competent, and courteous. Initially, I was in constant contact with contractor, David Eskin. He was punctual, knowledgeable, and professional. In the second half of the project, I was in constant contact with Enna. She was professional, knowledgeable, and very attentive to my requests. Whenever I had a question or concern, I could text her and she would respond within minutes. That was important to me and I appreciated the expediency. Based on my customer experience with Enna, I can say she cares a lot about the reputation of the company and delivering great customer satisfaction. The project is now complete, and thanks to Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc., I have two beautiful bathrooms."
5,"My wife and I have added a master bathroom and walk in closet, as well as adding a new linen closet and floors throughout the house with Horizon Construction. We are so happy with the outcome and how our project manager answered any questions we had along the way. We feel confident that if any issues pop up in the future that we can call and they will send someone out to correct. We have referred Horizon to our friends and will recommend them in the future as we are so happy with the outcome of our house."
5,"I contacted Houzz to search for a contractor to remodel our two small bathrooms.  I did not know where to start.  They put me in touch with Horizon and within a couple of days I was meeting with Eitan Beznos, their bathroom specialist. What impressed me most about Eitan was his friendliness and his desire to look after my every remodeling need. He was up front with the cost and the time it would take to complete both bathrooms. He recommended the best place to shop for tile and bathroom fixtures. He even took me shopping to look for vanities and helped me choose the size and design I was looking for.  Once the work was started the project crew became extended family, coming and going as needed. I was contacted almost daily by Eitan or Genesis Millan from the office to make sure I knew what was the plan for the day.  There were inspections at each stage of the project  and we still came in under the original time frame given.  I am so pleased with the  professionalism of the everyone who was a part of the remodel, the quality of the workmanship and the beauty of both bathrooms."
5,"We are very pleased with the way our fireplace wall looks .
Each phase of the project was done by workers who were skilled and experienced. 
They did their job quickly and always made sure the room was kept clean.
The project was unique and changes the appearance of the whole room. 
We would recommend David Eskin our project manager and Horizon Construction & Remodeling Inc to anyone thinking of Remodeling any room in their house"
5,"My wife, Kathy and I back in late July contacted three contractors to provide us an estimate to remodel our bathroom’s toilet and shower area.  Eitan Beznos provided us, what we felt was the estimate and help.  For this remodel, we were under somewhat of a time constraint to try and complete the project by 9/3.  
Eitan’s crew started demolition as promised on the day as promised.  Eitan had Ron, and George come in for the rough framing, electrical and plumbing, which was completed within the first week along with the Hot Mopping.  Ron and George and the hot mop person did an incredible job completing on schedule or even ahead of schedule.
The main impact to the remodel, was from the city inspection crew.  While we were delayed a week before we could tile the shower and the floor, Eitan and Ron had their tiling crew work the Labor Day Weekend to try and catch up, which again we were held up for city inspection. Further delaying completion.  George came in to perform the finish work, even coming in late in the day, I am sure after putting in a full day on another job.  The custom shower doors that have been installed are beautiful. 
We have had numerous construction jobs performed over the years, (pool installation, patio install, room additions, etc) and Eitan was always available either by phone or coming by to check, and everyone who worked on the remodel was friendly, professional, always cleaned up and tried to help minimalize the impact of dust, smell and noise as much as possible.
I will definitely look to Horizon for any further work."
5,"I met with David Eskin from Horizon Construction; he was very friendly and professional.  We discussed the projected and my expectations.  Within a few days, David had the estimate ready and we met for a second time.  When we met to review the proposal, David went through everything in detail.  

A few days later, I called David and told him that I would like Horizon to be the contractor for my project.  We then agreed on a starting date.  I told David I would be out of the country during the beginning phases of the project.  He assured me that wouldn’t be a problem and would keep me posted throughout the process.  

I really enjoyed going to their showroom to pick out the materials for the project, I felt like a kid in a candy store.  David was there through that process as well and offered suggestions if asked.  

Everything went smoothly for the most part throughout the process.  Some issues came up regarding the electrical panel, this was no fault of David’s, and he was quick to resolve the issues.  David was always quick to respond to my text messages or emails to address any questions or concerns I might have had.  

For the most part, the project came out better than anticipated.  Everyone who was involved with this project was always kind, courteous and eager to assist.  

Thank you, Horizon!!!

5,"We were very happy with the work done by Horizon
Construction on our remodeling project. We love our 1954
suburban home, but the two bathrooms were in serious need
of updating. Horizon started work and we immediately knew
we were in good hands. The workmanship on the floor and
shower tile was superb. In our master bath we had custom tiles
installed in the shampoo shelf that made our shower really
shine. The workers in charge of painting, vanity installation
and plumbing were very friendly and professional. We felt
very comfortable having them in our house. They answered
questions and communicated their progress to us. The overall
job was done in a timely manner and we were always informed
of any delays.
David the project manager kept us updated throughout the
entire process and helped us to realize our vision of a
southwestern style guest bathroom. He took care of all the
paperwork with our city's permit process. We were given
notice of any delays and he responded to texts immediately.
On one occasion, while we were shopping for vanities at a local
warehouse, he texted with us for over half an hour to make
sure we got the right one. Halfway through the project we
decided to re-pipe our entire house and David made that
happen. His plumbing crew had the re-pipe done in two days.
We feel confident recommending Horizon for your remodeling
needs. They respected our house and it showed in their work.
We can't wait to show off our new bathrooms to friends and
family!"
5,"We wanted to remodel for a long time.  Had interviewed several contractors. We didn’t know anyone here.  When we met David from Horizon we felt safe. He understood our vision and helped us clarify it. We liked that Horizon is 1 stop destination with a showroom, this is truly helpful in this process. We chose David Eskin with Horizon Construction and Remodeling, Inc. to and it turned beautiful. We Loved All horizon workers.  We had few communication glitches but those were resolved right away. David did a great job keeping his cool and listening to all our questions and concerns and was on top of it right away ready to explain and resolve. 
My only feedback will be in this area - to try and explain the clients more so less questions will arise. 
Overall we are very satified with our new kitchen and 2 new bathrooms and recommend Horizon construction and remodeling in Fullerton CA 
to others !"
5,"I contracted Horizon to do a remodel of a portion of the house that converted an old bedroom and master/bathroom, into a modern master with a large bedroom and guest bathroom. The initial budget was doubled what was targeted due to many unexpected expenses (some due to my request, others due to lack of foresight in planning).

The workmanship was of good quality generally but there were areas where attention to detail was not taken. 

The customer service has been the best part of working with Horizon. When problems arose with plumbing down the line, the company was responsive and helped fix the issue and even help with one that was due to the fixtures. They also did not charge for small minor requests (swapping faucet on an unrelated portion of the house).

Overall, I would say that the experience is positive."
5,"Horizon Construction recently completed a fireplace remodel in my home.  This was our first attempt at any major work here.  They were very professional and did a great job.  There were times when they had to work around my schedule and times when workers remained until evening to finish a project.  
I appreciate the prompt responses I received from Mike and the office staff when I had questions. He made good suggestions and had explanations about the process.  As in another review, the cost was significant for a one-wall redo, but I’m very happy with the result.  
There’s a small adjustment needed in the recessed lighting, but I’m confident this will be finished soon.  Overall, I think they were professional and easy to work with."
5,"While searching for a quartz counter top to coordinate with my existing beige flooring, I discovered Horizon.  They had what I wanted and secured a backsplash with a mosaic to complete the color scheme. Mark is a hands on contractor-owner .  He oversees every step of the job and there is little down time in the process.  The workers willingly try to accommodate customer requests.  If an installation is not satisfactory, it is corrected.  Horizon does an excellent job for the price charged. 

Arlene Hoskins"
4,"After poor experiences with previous contractors, we came into our next home repair project with reservations and a long check-list of characteristics we wanted in our next contractors, including responsiveness, professionalism, expertise, and follow-through.  Horizon was one of the half dozen businesses we solicited.

If cost was the only factor, Horizon would not have been selected.  While the company provided discounts, its estimate was triple the lowest bid and thousands more than another contractor we were considering.

We met Rey and Omri, and we were impressed with the way they addressed our concerns and exuded pride in the company’s reputation for high customer service and satisfaction.

We got what we paid for:
• Jobs were completed as scheduled (or there was sufficient communication and transparency during the few times complications arose).
• Horizon was responsive, both in its communication and follow-through with requests.
• Workmanship and attention to detail was excellent.
• The company handled minor incidental items without charging us extra.
• Half a year later, we contacted the business about a warranty issue.  • The company was prompt in its response, and the problem was fixed within a few days.

It is evident Horizon values maintaining positive relations with its customers.  If price is not the sole determinant, we recommend the company and will continue to keep it at the top of our list for future remodeling projects."
5,"I bought a house last year and worked with David to remodel the kitchen, master bathroom and guest bathroom. David was professional and had great design ideas. He designed the layouts and helped me selecting the materials for the kitchen and the bathrooms. The transformation was amazing. The open floor plan between the kitchen and the family room makes the house looks incredible expansive. The projects were finished on time and passed all the inspections. The final results were exactly as my vision of my house should be!"
4,"As is common with many construction projects, we experienced several issues and it took longer than originally planned. However, David and Mark addressed and corrected all issues, even ripping out and starting over on several items when necessary. Despite the issues and timing delays, Horizon did come in on budget, and we absolutely love the new bathrooms and bedroom floor!"
5,"Horizon construction built a bathroom for me in my detached recreational space. The room was transformed from a simple and basic recreational room into a livable and enjoyable space that is perfect for single travels or couples looking to stay in a comfy and welcoming space while visiting our lovely state of California. David and his construction team finished the job in just over a month, on budget and on time. I would recommend Horizon construction to others looking room additions or things similar to what we had done to our home."
5,"I found Horizon Construction on the Houzz app after several attempts to connect with a few other contractors. I sent an email on a Sunday and got a response the following Monday. The great communication with Horizon continued through my entire project of a complete remodel of my kitchen, guest bathroom and walk in closet. They also installed all new windows and tile flooring. My project manager was David and he was the best, made himself available to me for all of my many questions and decisions even while he was on vacation! Working with Enna and the others at the office were perfect as well. I couldn’t be more pleased with the outcome of my remodel. 

Best Regards,
Debbie Karmelich"
5,Thank you Horizon for all your help making our guest/additional bathroom for my mother who recently moved in with us a place she loves.  David was very kind and understanding of what we wanted and the crews that came to work were very professional.  We look forward to having additional work done in our house by Horizon so all of our rooms can be just as beautiful.
5,"Horizon did a terrific job on a complete makeover of our master bathroom (including the shower, jacuzzi, flooring, counter-tops, sinks, and cabinetry) and the replacement of all kitchen cabinetry, drawers, and sink.  This was a big project for us -- so it was important to select a contractor who was reliable, had all the right skill sets, and was committed to quality.  Horizon delivered on all fronts with flying colors!

We found Horizon through Angie’s List.  After reading comments on Angie’s List and on many other web sites such as BBB and Yelp, we decided to get estimates from Horizon and three other service providers.   After our initial interview with each prospective provider, we concluded that Horizon provided the most comprehensive services at pricing that was very competitive.    

Our project involved a variety of skillsets including woodworking, plumbing, electrical, tile installation, fabrication and cutting of counter-top surfaces, and finishing and painting.  Rather than hiring a jack-of-all trades, Horizon delivered highly skilled craftsmen in each field who completely embraced Horizon’s expectations for quality.

Our Horizon project manager David was instrumental to the success of our project.  David did a great job coordinating and supervising the work of each of the craftsmen.  David was very responsive and easy to reach when questions arose.  David was on site regularly to inspect progress and assure that the craftsmen met Horizon’s high expectations for quality.  On occasions when David noted items requiring special attention, the craftsmen were eager to respond.  David was also very responsive and attentive to all observations we shared as the project progressed.  It was clear that the craftsmen all shared Horizon’s deep commitment to quality.  The craftsmen were also very courteous and productive throughout the duration of our project.  

We are very pleased with the end-product and the process Horizon followed from start to finish (including design suggestions and assistance with surface material selections).  Thank you very much to all of the Horizon project team (including the back-office team) for a job well done! 

We wholeheartedly recommend using Horizon and will most certainly use Horizon for any projects we undertake in the future."
5,"(Originally written about 3.5 months after job completion).  I must admit that we were highly cautious with our next bathroom remodel hire. Reason being was a previous contractor abandoned our master bathroom remodel after attempts to have them address valid concerns. That other contractor's license was eventually suspended after multiple consumer complaints were filed. Thankfully, working with Horizon Construction and Remodeling Inc on addressing a previous contractor's mess ups and then completing a redo of another bathroom in our home was a much better experience. The new remodel job that was Horizon's from start to finish was completed in a timely manner. With our older house, there were issues uncovered after the demo process that were not too much of a surprise. The issue extended our timeline and did add somewhat minor costs to the job. When questions or concerns were raised, Mike Roppo, our project leader, was responsive to address issues and provide explanations before the job moved forward. I must state that some of the worksite conditions at the end of a couple jobs were not ideal. For example, white residue was left on our hedges and some of our walkway from workers mixing materials - possibly grout. Also, workers left cigarette butts in our newly installed small rocks landscaping that couldn't just get swept out easily. Workers did clean up nicely for all interior jobs. Finally, after completion of both bathrooms, two more events occurred. First, Horizon came out and made repairs that surfaced, like settling cracks in the grout for example. This was part of their contract, but it was done in a timely fashion. Second, Horizon was helpful with our complaint to the contractor license board by providing a statement of the condition of the bathroom remodel that was abandoned. Overall, we would include Horizon on our list of contractors to work with again."
5,"Sounds corny but it is true – When you deal with Horizon Construction & remodeling, you are treated like family. 
It’s my last major project and I have been putting it off for many years. Life happened and it is never the right time to remodel. But, we are glad we finally did it!
 They are very patient people and never made me feel indecisive despite the fact that I am. I doubt there are many firms in the entire country that are genial and comfortable and just plain nice. Also, they explain everything in as much or as little detail as you want and all those details are laid out in an organized and thorough fashion. Everyone there is super professional. They are a treasure.
Love my new house !
Thank you Horizon Construction and remodeling"
5,"We were impressed with everyone we interacted with at Horizon, especially our contact person named Mike.  They finished the project before estimated time and there were no extra charges for anything!  We would recommend this company to our family and friends."
5,"Frequently a home renovation is not for the faint-of-heart. There are countless general contractors to choose from, some first-rate and some unscrupulous, and which one to hire is often the biggest unknown factor in a successful execution of transforming an idea into fruition. In my case I could not be happier. Mark Besnos, his wife Enna and all the team at Horizon were absolutely the best. Having done many a previous renovation on properties over the years, I can truthfully say that Mark's diligence and demand for perfection overseeing my project is something I've seldom witnessed before. He is more than a simple ""hammer and nails"" contractor: Mark is a symbiosis of one part architectural engineer with the aesthetic eye of an interior designer. With his immense help we were able to harmoniously blend the various colors of granite, travertine tile, cabinetry and backsplash, updating a tired mid-century ranch home kitchen into a Tuscan showplace."
1,"Horizon Construction & Remodeling in 2018 lied about getting City inspections done, damaged my home and covered up the damage, and left dangerous conditions throughout my home, leaving myself and my family at risk. For example, just some of the things Inspectors found: sharp roof shingles unattached on my roof which could have fallen and cut us; they left exposed electrical wiring in the attic = potential fire danger; extremely hot pipes not insulated, which could have burnt us, and more. The City is making me remove construction Horizon did because they lied about getting approval. DO NOT HIRE THEM. They are a dangerous company. They also gave a portion of the remodel to another general contractor (not as a subcontractor) without my approval.  Horizon Construction (Mark Besnos) did not supervise this other contractor, who’s license has been suspended and is being prosecuted by the California Attorney General’s Office. All of this can be confirmed.  This was a big project and Horizon Construction & Remodeling took my money and have left my entire family devastated by the amount of damage they did to our home."
5,"We just completed our remodel of two bathrooms with Horizon Construction. We are very happy with the final product. The work was completed on a timely basis with great communication regarding scheduling, problem solving and attention to any issues that came up. We did have a few issues that needed some attention, but they were completed to our satisfaction. I was very nervous when we first started the project because I am very detail oriented and was afraid the work  might not meet our expectations- but it most certainly does. 

David was our project manager and always responded back to any issues that came up on a very timely basis- always available via phone or email, even on weekends. The office staff was equally responsive, and that made this project so much easier to deal with. 

We did have a little delay due to the rainy weather over the last couple of months, but other than that, someone was here working pretty much every day since our project started the first week of January . 

 Very happy with our choice of Horizon and highly recommend them for your remodeling needs."
5,"We chose Horizon Construction & Remodeling for our project.    They are a family owned business that provides outstanding customer service.  Our project was a kitchen and living room remodel.  Our home was built in the early 50’s with the center piece of the home being an indoor bar-b-que taking up most of one wall of a very small kitchen and a massive fireplace in the living room.  After weeks of delays and concerns from the city, an engineer and architect from Horizon were brought in to help finalize plans.  The final decision was to remove the massive brick structure.  The kitchen and living room were gutted, fireplace and bar-be-que demolished and a new wall was constructed.   We especially liked that everything we needed was on display at their showroom and the staff was extremely patient and helpful as we make our choices.  Throughout the remodel our project manager, David, and the office staff kept us informed as to what was happening and who was coming to work the next day.  Each day the crew working cleaned up and did not leave a mess.  David, Enna, Genesis and the office staff were always very professional and constantly checking as to how we were doing since we stayed in the home throughout the remodel.  We are extremely pleased with the job done for us by Horizon Construction &Remodeling and we highly recommend them.
Rick and Sandy Lewis"
5,"The team at Horizon Construction & Remodeling has given us the master suite of our dreams! My wife and I love our mid-century house, but the master bathroom left a lot to be desired. Our project manager, Mike, helped us maximize the space by borrowing from a largely unused kitchenette area and was able to include every single one of the custom cabinets, appliances, and fixtures we set our hearts on. Now we have a luxurious, spacious bathroom and a lovely bar area with plenty of storage that will be excellent for entertaining guests. Although there are always some complications in a remodel this large, the whole process went very smoothly and Horizon took care of us at every step - we were always left feeling our home was in the best hands. Thank you so much for helping us fall in love with our house all over again!"
5,"From the very first phone call I made to Horizon I felt valued as a client. The office staff was always kind and helpful. Our project manager, David, was easy to work with and was always responsive to any questions or concerns. He stopped by frequently to check the progress throughout the project and kept us informed of the next phase and work scheduling. All the tradesmen involved were professional, respectful of our home, great to talk with and did an excellent job. Any remodeling project can be stressful, but I believe that the service we received from Horizon made the process as smooth as possible.  We love our beautiful new kitchen and bathroom. I would highly recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling for any home project and would certainly use them again."
5,Mark Besnos and his crew at Horizon Construction and Remodeling did an awesome job on all of my remodel projects in my home. I especially like that if there is something that you don’t quite like they will fix it for you right away. I recommend them because I love how everything turned out and I will use them again for my next project!
5,"Horizon Construction did an awesome job on our Kitchen Remodel.  We put off remodeling for so many years but upon reading all the good reviews on this company we finally decided it was time.  The outcome was exactly how I envisioned it.  David, our project manager, as well as everyone in the office were always available to help us with any little (or big) question or concern.  We were always told what to expect at each stage and all the contractors were very professional and always kept the work area clean each evening.  All deadlines where met as scheduled and no ""surprise"" costs were incurred.   Thank You Horizon Construction and Remodeling"
5,"I interviewed multiple contractors to complete a full bathroom remodel for 3 bathrooms.  I ultimately chose Horizon because I knew they would be the right fit for the project I was undertaking.  They are a small family owned business that has the customer’s satisfaction in the forefront of their minds.   We agreed that we would complete the project in two phases.  We completed a hall and master bathroom remodel first with the third bathroom to take place after the first of the year.  
Both Horizon and their subcontractors are available to answer questions and assist with any decision making you may need or ideas to make your project have an outcome that you are 100% satisfied with.  The workmanship, timeliness and cleanliness of each subcontractor was impeccable.  I would highly recommend Horizon for your next remodel."
4,"I started this bathroom remodel with a different contractor - but it didn’t go well. So I hired Horizon Construction & Remodeling and my bathroom is absolutely stunning. I will recommend them to friends and family. David my project manager was great, he always assured me that all will be taken care for me and I actually could sleep good at night. And I did ! I’m very happy ! 
Any questions that come out were addressed in a very timely manner. 
Which made me feel very comfortable. 
Now the project is complete it looks absolutely wonderful beyond my expectations 
My family and I really love it!"
5,"I interviewed three contractors and chose Mark Besnos and Horizon for an extensive interior remodel of my home – master bedroom and bath, guest bathroom, kitchen.  The project included removing a soffit ceiling in about half the house, installing a new support beam to eliminate a post, wainscoting in the living and dining room, hardwood flooring in the renovated areas (except the bathrooms), two new windows, and a new fireplace mantel.  Mark wasn’t the least expensive but based on his experience and our discussion I felt he would be “hands on” and would provide guidance during the course of the project.  Mark has excellent taste.  He was patient and worked with me and my cousin (who was consulting with me) very well.  He was earnest in trying to accommodate his visits to my work schedule.  A project of this magnitude is bound to encounter some challenges, and Mark was good at explaining them and presenting options, while giving me time to reflect.  The various trades who worked on my home were top notch, and when there were some issues Mark immediately took steps to correct, fix, re-do, what needed to be done. An example is the flooring.  There was a haze on the floor and Mark contacted the manufacturer and called in and paid (at his expense) a professional to inspect the floor and make recommendations.  Mark and his team were always on top of things, communicating often via email (my preference) and also texts.  The end result has exceeded my expectations.  I am thrilled with my new, open concept, home.  The kitchen is amazing, the fireplace is a focal point, and I absolutely love my master bathroom.   We had some fun with the guest bathroom as well.  Now I need artwork!  Bottom line . . . if someone leaves me a house in his or her will and I have to remodel it, I’m calling Mark and Horizon."
5,We love Horizon. We wanted to do an exterior remodel and contacted them. They were there every step of the way and always available when we had questions. They were on time and kept to their schedule. They constantly kept us updated on the project. Mark is great...he listened to what we were thinking and helped make it reality.  We really liked that Mark let’s you know if there are any problems and helps come up with solutions. They take care of their customers!  Enna was also amazing and was always available to answer questions. We will use them again for our next project!
5,Horizon did a wonderful job with our kitchen. They were clear communicators all along the way and went the extra mile to accommodate our requests. We love our new kitchen!
5,"My wife and I made the decision to completely remodel our 55 year old kitchen which included removing a couple of walls to open it up to the dining room and living room. After deeply vetting numerous contractors and securing proposals, we selected Horizon Construction in Fullerton, CA. Mark Besnos, company owner, was by far the most detail oriented and considerate home improvement contractor we’ve ever worked with. Throughout all phases of the project, Horizon provided extraordinary workmanship in a very timely manner. Of course with any major project there are a few challenges. Horizon Construction remedied every issue with effective contingency plans for any problem they encountered.  Here is an excellent example of superior service: We selected and ordered quartz counter tops from MSI of Orange, CA.  When the quartz counter tops arrived and were installed, they had a number of finishing defects which Horizon tried to repair. Unfortunately, the defects were irreparable and MSI would not stand behind their product and workmanship. Mark and Horizon Construction however alleviated our aggravation by selflessly offering us a partial financial reimbursement even though the counter top finishing was not Horizon’s responsibility. 
From beginning to completion, Horizon Construction exhibited professionalism, pride of workmanship and a commitment to excellence. If you are seeking the finest company to successfully bring your remodeling dreams to reality, Horizon Construction is unquestionably the one!"
5,"We were referred to Horizon Construction from a neighbor that had recently hired them for a bathroom & kitchen remodel.  Although Horizon’s was quote was higher than previous quotes, we went with them based on the quality of workmanship we saw in my neighbor’s home plus their great online reviews. 
The first couple of weeks went well. We were told the job would take 4-5 weeks to complete. The first round of workers and inspector were on schedule. Around week three things slowed down.  The tile guy only worked between 3-5 hours a day. We ran into a couple problems with paint that resulted in “do-overs”.  Some of the mistakes made by the painters were somewhat novice. However our project manager was quick to respond and correct the issues. The job was completed at the end of week five.
At the end, our experience with Horizon Construction was a great one. The office staff and project manager were pleasant and attentive to our concerns.  We are happy with the work done in our bathroom and would consider using them again in the future.  I highly recommend Horizon Construction to anyone looking to do a remodel/construction in their home."
5,"It went great! Enna ,David and the entire Horizon Group were a pleasure to work with. Expectations clearly communicated and met. Trades arrived when scheduled, on time and prepared. The few problems that came up were quickly resolved to our satisfaction. We are planning further work next year and will use Horizon Construction and Remodel again. We have full confidence that we will be treated as fairly and professionally as we were on this project"
5,"We contracted with Horizon Construction and Remodeling to remodel all three of our bathrooms.  Mark, Enna and the administrative staff were fully involved throughout the project providing updates, schedule reminders and addressing all of our concerns along the way.  While we were upgrading the two upstairs bathrooms, we had a family of 5 sharing a downstairs shower.  Mark was good about keeping the project moving forward and getting us use of the upstairs bathrooms as soon as possible.  During the demo work, we uncovered bathtub rust.  Mark covered the options and was able to work in the schedule a replacement with a project quick change order.  We also decided midflight of the remodel that the existing cabinets were not going to work.  Mark once again was able to provide options for us to address within our timeframe and budget.  As during any remodel big or small, issues and challenges will arise.  Mark and the whole Horizon team went out of their way to make sure my wife and I were extremely pleased with the process and end results.  We very much appreciated the communication, periodic onsite morning meetings and the breakdown of payments spread throughout the 4 month project that allowed us a little more control of the finances.  Overall, we appreciated the honesty, upfront discussions, and their dedication to details to make our bathrooms beautiful.  We would not hesitate to contract with them again.  Thank you Mark, Enna and the whole Horizon Construction and Remodel team."
5,"I have been wanting to remodel my kitchen for several years and the opportunity finally presented itself.
Horizon was recommended to me by my neighbor so I decided to include them in the process of choosing a contractor.
All of the contractors provided about the same cost to do the remodel but my final decision went to Horizon. 
I choose Horizon to do the job because first impressions do matter and Horizon impressed me with their professional manner and responsiveness. 
When the job started I was again pleased with the scheduling and notifications I received from Enna and Genesis. Like most people, I am a busy person and I like to be informed and prepared. Being kept in the loop about the activity at my home was very helpful and appreciated.




During the remodel process my home and garage were cleaned up and neat when I arrived home, always a welcome sight! The kitchen was completed before the scheduled end date which was a great surprise. But most of all the kitchen is gorgeous! The workmanship is beautiful and the I couldn't be happier with the result! I would definitely recommend Horizon to anyone wanting or needing to start a construction project!"
5,"We want to thank Horizon Construction & Remodeling, Inc. 
Especially Enna & David for our BEAUTIFUL  makeover kitchen.
They were really helpful in helping us select our cabinets, counter tops and backsplash and the color combination for our kitchen.
David was great! 
He was here and checked each phase of the work and made sure all work was done satisfactory.
the workers were great in their preparation and cleaning up before leaving.
Thank you again Horizon, we are very pleased with the work done!"
5,"You can feel comfortable hiring Horizon Construction and Remodeling for your next house project!  I had to do lots of repair and maintenance on my Queen Anne Victorian home and Project Manager Mike and the folks at Horizon came through with flying colors.   I replaced the roof, cleaned and re-insulated the attic, added new floors upstairs, upgraded some electrical, repaired plater ceilings and painted the exterior with a three color ""Painted Lady"" look for the house.  All the sub-contractors were polite, fine craftsmen and always on time. Mike was great communicating  with me at all times.  This situation has not always been true for contractors I've interviewed to work on my house.  Usually, they come to the house, say they will give me an estimate, and never call back.  Horizon and their team did  high quality work on a difficult older home."
5,"Horizon Construction and Remodeling recently remodeled my kitchen and I highly recommend their work.  They completed my project on time and on budget.

Our project manager, Mike, was a positive force from beginning to end.  Anytime I texted him he answered back right away, every time.  He was always on top of things and very sensitive to any concerns I might have.

The staff at Horizon was also great.  They kept me informed every step along the way as to what was going to be done next.  Each day after work was completed the workers left the area extremely clean.  They never left a mess at any time which I appreciated.

It was a remarkably stress free remodel and the results were exactly as I had envisioned.  I will definitely use them again for any project in the future."
5,"I chose Horizon to do a complete kitchen remodel, add an additional 100 square feet and create a 9’ pass through between the kitchen and family room.  This entailed major construction – engineering, demo, footings, support beams, framing, insulation, electrical, plumbing, paint, floor tile, cabinets, countertops, and installing appliances.  
 
Mark Besnos, the owner, was the project manager and Enna and Genesis (back office) provided education and guidance throughout the entire project.  The approximate timeline given was three months; it was finished in two months.  Mark worked with me in building the kitchen in stages to ensure I was able to stay within my budget. 
 
Mark made suggestions along the way (which I appreciated) – I agreed with some and others I didn’t.  For instance, during construction, he prompted me to think about raising the ceiling – I’m very thankful I agreed with his recommendation – it worked out well.  There was never any pressure to do anything I didn’t want to do. 
 
Communication is always the key to success.  I was always aware of the next steps.  Whenever I had questions, Mark or Enna promptly answered.  They even answered questions and concerns while they were on vacation – they are dedicated to their profession. There were some small concerns or issues along the way – they were addressed and resolved in a timely manner which was greatly appreciated.
 
This has been an educational and rewarding experience.  A lot has to do with the relationship established with the client.  The Besnos family (Mark and Enna), from the beginning, have been friendly, patient, honest and trustworthy.
 
I now have a beautiful dream kitchen to enjoy with family.  Thank you Mark and Enna."
5,The Horizon team did an OUTSTANDING job at my home. We had a bathroom remodel which they basically completely redesigned and it looks absolutely amazing!!! So happy with the outcome and service!
4,"We searched on all popular web sites to look for a recommended contractor.  Horizon beat out other companies and we met with Mark, the owner.  I explained to Mark what we were wanting and looking for.  Horizon was very timely and on task.  They always kept me in the loop of what I needed to do and what they were going to work on.  When I changed some of the design or wanted tile to be redone, Mark came right over and addressed the issues.  I liked how all of the workers cleaned up after themselves as well. All of Horizen’s employee’s were professional and friendly. Our kitchen looks great and functions so much better.  Our kids want to cook too.  Thank you Horizon."
5,"Our dream to remodel our kitchen began a couple of years ago.   We interviewed contractors but none worked out or followed up with us.   We began to again search in the summer of 2017 and met with Mark of Horizon Construction as well as with other contractors.  We were especially impressed when we visited the Horizon  office to see cabinets and other materials.  Also, we were very impressed by Ena and the staff.   Mark had great ideas and helped us design a new kitchen for us. Work began in mid November (due to our schedule)  and progressed well with workers showing up on time almost every day.  Work included demolition, replacing all cabinets with granite tops and tile backsplash, creating an island with a sink which involved moving plumbing, widening of the doorway between the kitchen and dinning room, enclosure of a preexisting sliding door,  new floors in the hallways, kitchen and dining rooms and creating a new gas line and venting exhaust for the new range and other electrical upgrades.   The work progressed smoothly despite a few bumps in the road.  Mark made certain all work was done to his high expectations.   Ena and the office staff were always available to answer our questions.  Inspections went smooth and quickly.   The job was completed on schedule and to our satisfaction.   We highly recommend Horizon Construction and will not hesitate to call on them again for future projects."
5,"The complete remodel of one of our bathrooms was just completed by Horizon Construction last week. The bathroom is gorgeous. I could not be happier. The project manager, David, was constantly on top of the scheduling and progression of the work. He visited almost every day to make sure everything was going to plan and always asked if we had any questions or problems. Any issues that came up were immediately addressed. Compared to many contractors I have dealt with, the communication was wonderful.  The quality of the work was top notch and the various tradespeople (plumbers, electricians, painters, tile-setters, etc.) were all very pleasant and helpful. They were always on time per the schedule or if there was a delay, we received a timely e-mail and re-schedule time. The job was completed on time per the original promise date. The clean up at the end of the job was professionally done. I would highly recommend Horizon Construction for any remodeling job."
5,"Horizon construction and remodeling Inc. did our whole home meaning total kitchen remodeling (cabinets tile counters lighting), upstairs bathroom (tile flooring and vanity), all trim molding crown molding, wall repair, texture coat, painting everywhere, stairway new banister, carpet, vinyl plank flooring, back/ front doors, all electrical with new lights/ ceiling fans and interior doors. What a Beautiful job!! We couldn't be happier!! Kitchen looks like a model in a show room. The whole house is such a transformation that we feel like we're on vacation!! Mark and his workers were on time and so courteous. Horizon show room makes it so easy to pick out your products and it's not confusing. We would with no hesitation recommend Horizon  for All your remodeling needs inside and outside of your home. Thank You to All the Horizon work team!!

5,"Great service and professional workers! The company contractor and team were prompted on time, answered all the questions I had and performed the remodeling project in proficiency! Definitely recommended!"
5,"We met Horizon Construction & Remodeling Representative after meeting 2 other contractors and we must say we liked Horizon a lot.
The project manager was very knowledgeable and personable
He listen to us and made good suggestions and was always available for us
we honestly couldn't do this project without him!
It took longer than we planned because the remodel was done around the holiday season but it was worth it! The END product is beautiful 
We receive many compliments from family & friends
We appreciate the hard work - all workers were very dedicated and talented
We will spread the GOOD WORD ABOUT HORIZON!!!"
5,"We love the new bathroom! The old bathroom was cramped, damp and colored pink (the house was build in 1957). The only venting was the window. My father requires a full time caregiver and there was barely enough room in the bathroom for one grown man let alone two. Mark came up with an excellent floor plan and matched his ideas with our hopes and wishes. The bathroom was completely gutted. The plumbing for the shower (with shower head and hand shower) was added and the plumbing for the toilet and the vanity sink was moved. Three areas of lighting were added--over the vanity, over the toilet, and in the shower. A combination venting fan/light was installed. An additional electrical outlet was installed. The bathroom window was replaced. Floor to ceiling tile was installed for the shower as was a channel drain (the shower is 8 feet wide). The project was finished not only on time but 12 days early. The entry into the bathroom and the new shower can now accommodate a person in a wheelchair. Not only is it functional, it's beautiful in its modern palette of neutral grays, tans and creams. All work was professionally done and supervised by Mark. After the project was completed, Mark and Enna called to follow up. When there was an issue with the shower not draining, I made one call and Mark's workers were out the next morning to fix it. This was my first remodel project and on a whole it much better than I had hoped it could be. We are very satisfied and will be hiring Horizon for future projects."
5,"We chose Horizon to refresh the exterior of our home based upon the good ratings in Angie’s List and Houzz.  They were very prompt in setting a time to meet with us.  Leo listened very well to what we wanted to have done and then he walked us through how they would go about getting the job done.  He detailed for us the many steps they would go through to prepare for the work that would need to be done for removing old facade, adding new stucco, painting, adding stone veneer and replacing patio fence.  He explained some of the extra steps they do that others skip, which are important for a long-lasting result.  Leo laid out for us the expected start time and timeline for completion.  Based upon some other estimates that I had received, Horizon’s cost estimate was very reasonable.  Their back-office staff was also very helpful to us in selecting the materials to be used on the job and working with us on scheduling.  Once the job got started, it progressed according to plan, and all city inspections were completed timely without need for any change to the work they had done.  The job was completed to our satisfaction, on time and on budget; they even did a few extra add-ons without charging us anything extra.  Job well done, thank-you!"
5,"Thank you!

Horizon did a great job with my room addition with bathroom and patio.  Now I have a great guest room for when my friends and family come to visit. 

I now start my day on my new patio enjoying my coffee in the shade.  Mike the project manager was wonderful to work with   He was helpful in helping me designing both the interior and exterior layout.  He had a lot of great suggestions and was very knowledgeable.

I will not hesitate to call upon them for any additional work in the future."
5,"Mark and Enna were fantastic!  Mark has an excellent understanding of construction and the realities of renovating a home.  His recommendations reflect his extensive experience and his artistic flare.  We found that by listening to him, his ideas proved to be a better fit than our original ideas.  We are so very glad that we took his advice, especially regarding our kitchen remodel.  Horizon has an entire showroom of materials and other construction examples at their Fullerton location.  This made the selection of materials extremely convenient.  We also found that their material options were of very good quality.  We love the back-splash that we picked out in our kitchen!

When we first met Mark, he was 5 minutes early to our appointment.  Everyone we dealt with after the initial meeting was either early or exactly on time.  We never had to wait for anyone.  When a repair was needed or a concern arose, Enna resolved the matter very quickly, sometimes within the hour.  They were very up front about what was being done and they stayed on budget.  We moved out of our house for 2 months and they had us back in exactly on schedule.  No surprises.  Our home was very outdated and needed some serious attention and that is exactly what we got.  We would hire Horizon Construction and Remodeling again without question."
5,"In October 2018 I met with Mike, Project Manager, from Horizon Construction to do a basic kitchen & wet bar remodel.  He was very easy to work with and explained the process very clearly. Horizon replaced all my cabinets, installed new granite counter tops, backsplash, sinks and faucets, and painted the room. This was to be completed in 4 weeks, but ended up taking a little over 5 weeks as there were issues with some cabinets, backsplash, and minor electrical problems. Every concern or even complaint I voiced was immediately addressed and corrected. They all are focused on providing excellent customer service and making sure their clients are satisfied. Enna, owner, contacted me recently to ask if there was anything else I needed, and this was a month after completion. Cost of the project was within the budget I had allowed and felt their costs are reasonable and competitive. Even with the extra week to complete the project, the result, is a beautiful new kitchen, island and wet bar. I may be remodeling another room and would hire Horizon Construction again as their concern for customer satisfaction stands out…"
5,"Work was done in a timely fashion, and the quality was excellent. Each stage of the project was 
managed well, all workers were punctual and did a good job of cleaning up after work was done. Work 
was completed ahead of schedule and we were very happy with the final results."
4,"Project: Re-pipe whole house and install tankless water heater; replace ducts and install new AC/Furnace unit; remodel two bathrooms.

After speaking to three general construction companies, we decided to hire Horizon Construction for our projects. Their prices were reasonable as compared to the other companies, and we appreciated the detailed written scope of the project that they provided to us. Mark, Enna, and their office staff were very pleasant to work with; they also have a very nice showroom.

Overall, we are happy with how our projects turned out. Enna is great with communications. She always replied to our messages promptly to address our issues and concerns. We did have various issues with the workmanship and cleanliness of some of the trades that came to do the work, which made us felt that the project manager was not always attentive to what was being done at our house. We had to clean up a lot of the messes that were left every night when came home. Horizon could definitely benefit as a company, if they improve their ability to oversee a project more closely to ensure that things are being done properly by their sub-contractors. But, in general, Mark and Enna do care about the satisfaction of their customers. They are committed to making things right. They always made sure that we were happy with the end result. We never felt like Enna or Mark would just ignore us or our concerns. For this reason alone, we would recommend their company to others."
5,"We loved the fact Horizon had a nice showroom where we could find everything we liked. It made all decision process much easier for us. 
Mark Besnos did excellent job, he planned everything very well. The communication was great and easy. Enna Eskin was helpful at office and over emails. We love our new kitchen it is just like we imagined even better ! This is now a perfect summer house for our big family 
Thank you Horizon !"
5,"Well, I wish I had something fun and exciting like a room addition or kitchen remodel to talk about, but our project was just a boring, complicated, extensive repair/renovation. For more than a decade, every time we had a major storm, we got flooding in our family room, and every time we thought we had fixed the problem, when the next storm came, the water re-appeared. We talked to several contractors, and they all had pretty much the same opinion. Since we couldn’t figure our the source or sources of the leaking, the only way to fix it for sure would be to completely remove and replace the stucco and paper from the rear of the house, and replace all the windows. This would also involve detaching and disassembling a large, wood patio cover, and then putting it back together. One contractor didn’t even want to take the job.

We chose Horizon due to a high recommendation from my brother who had used them for a kitchen re-model. The estimate and bid process was quick and smooth, and communication and scheduling with Enna and the office was great throughout. Mark was quick to address the problems, which were many, due to the fact that, as it turned out, our leaks were coming from more than one source.

The quality of the work, for the most part was excellent. In fact, the building inspector commented that the workmanship of the wrapping job was the best he had ever seen. My only complaint is that the work of the window installers was less than stellar, but all-in-all,  the final outcome was good. The color and texture of the stucco also perfectly matches the rest of the house.

We did a water test, and all looks good. We won’t know for sure until the next big storm, but I’m confident that we’ll have a dry family room. so confident, In fact, that we just installed new carpet."
5,Mark and team just finished giving our old house a face lift. Outstanding job! Mark gave us some great advice on how make the house look its best. His input/opinions matched our taste. Mark's attention to details and the quality of the work ensured the outcome was to our satisfaction. We would definitely recommend them and use them again on our next project. (New garage doors are on order...)
5,"After talking to several contractors, we reached out to Horizon Construction for a bid. Mark came out to our house to discuss our project. After talking a while, Mark gave suggestions for changes to the blue prints. It took 7 months with our previous contractor/architect to get the changes made, but they were unquestionably worth the wait. Once we had approval from the city Mark worked us into their busy schedule right away. Mark and his crew worked every day to get our project finished in the timeline they gave us. 
Like most projects there were setbacks, budget changes, and other bumps in the road. However, Mark and his team worked really hard. They did a great job scheduling inspections to keep the job moving. All of the budget changes were because of things we wanted or added not because of his incorrect bid. When issues arose, his office staff was great at contacting us, communicating via phone and email, and answered questions quickly. 
Mark and Enna were a joy to work with, they were punctual, professional, offered good ideas, and allowed us to do some of the work ourselves. Mark is very particular in the way he expects the work to look, he treats his projects likes it is his own place. Mark and Enna always worked diligently to be sure we were happy with the products and services they provided. Despite skepticism from friends and neighbors, Mark was done a few days early. 
We would definitely recommend Horizon Construction to any of our family and friends."
1,"The owner is stuck up and rude. Says he's the owner and is taking his time to come give us an estimate. Says he doesn't do small things and looked like he didn't want to be at our house wasting his precious time. The way he talked and acted throughout the process made me feel like our job was too small for him and we were wasting his time. When I called to book my appointment for a consultation, I was very specific twice about what I needed to be done and asked if our job was too small and the person who setup my appointment said their smallest job was $10k. So he should have already know the job details prior to coming. But when the owner showed up and realized we were small to him he didn't seemed like he wanted to waste his time on us. He quoted me $47k for doing my yard which I had bids from other contractors and the highest bid was $15k. I told him that and he replied that he will hire and attorney and open escrow with $10k and said if I can find someone to do the job for $15k he will give me $10k and if not I need to give him $5k. What he said was unbelievable. I said I'm not going to waste your time anymore and he said EXACTLY and left. On their website it says, ""we are your friendly contractor and want to make it a delightful experience for our customers "". Well, our experience wasn't really delightful and the owner wasn't really friendly! Maybe if I had a million dollar home for him to remodel and the job was hundred of thousands he would've acted and talked differently because he did mention he was working on a $200k pool in Palos Verdes for a $15million home. It's fine if you don't work on small jobs but tell your customers ahead of time instead of coming into their home with no common courtesy.

Thank you for your reply. We did hire someone to do the job. But it’s not the price I’m talking about that is wrong with your company. I’m talking about your owner’s attitude when he came to my house. I think he should at least apologize for that instead of trying to write a response to this review to prove that there was nothing wrong with his attitude and the way he talked to a potential customer. I don’t appreciate it someone that I asked to come give me an estimate to act like the way he did. Thank you for wishing me good luck because I do feel the luckiest part was to not hire your company for the job!"
5,"""We did our research! Horizon construction company was great! The workmanship was beyond our expectations. Our kitchen turned out better then what we thought possible. If you're searching for a construction company for any remodel, give them a call, you will not be disappointed. Thanks to Mike our contractor, he listened to us and gave us great advise.  They even supported us with fixes after the warranty period, just awesome!"""
4,"We were looking around to get a kitchen and bathroom remodel. We met with several contractors but really liked Mike. He was professional, knowledgeable and we liked his design ideas and the quote. 

We ran into unexpected delays from the beginning and that set our timeline back out the gate (asbestos abatement). However, when the project got moving, it took off well. 
There were some other bumps in road that caused delays as well, most were unexpected. 

Overall, we give a four star rating.  Certain aspects of the process were great and others were lacking. 
The office staff was great and tried to be helpful and accommodating. We had been lead to believe that we would have a working toilet and work would be done around it since we only have one bathroom. We had made arrangements for the first few weeks and as we got closer to thanksgiving week and we were aware that little work would be done, it became a problem.  Enna made it work and got the flooring laid and the toilet connected before the holiday. 

The downfall of the process was either scheduling or communication or something.  When we made a change, no matter how big or small, time was added to the timeline. Although technically they finished within the timeline, there were days, on days, on days where little or nothing happened. One day someone came for all of fifteen minutes and then nothing for a week.  We had all the rooms painted and we have never known painting to take so long. The plumber was great. The electrician was great, the framer was great.  They all cleaned up well at the end of the day and the few times it wasn't quite right, Mike was on it and had it taken care of. 
 
Overall we are happy with the end result and would hire Horizon again."
5,"Horizon Construction was such a lucky find for me! I inherited a house from my parents on Balboa Island that was built in 1933. As my parents aged there was a lot of deferred maintenance that needed to be addressed. I had several contractors come and give me estimates and “advice”, but no one took the time like Mike of Horizon Construction did to really find out what I wanted to do and give me realistic quotes.. He was able to preserve the charm and character that the house had, while making it safe and clean with modern amenities. It was a long (8 months+) project, but in that time the quality and care was always there, and my wishes were foremost.  I am happy to give the folks at Horizon Construction “Two Thumbs Up” and would urge anyone wanting a remodel to contact them.

Sincerely,
Suzanne S."
5,"We are happy with the final results of our remodeled kitchen.  Eitan, our Project Manager was the best to work with.  Thank you very much."
4,"Project: Kitchen update: Replaced tile countertops with granite; added backsplash; lowered the bar to counter height and expanded the peninsula.  Installed new sink, induction cook top and downdraft. 

Comments: After talking with other contractors, we chose Horizon Construction who did a nice job with our kitchen update. The workers and project manager were timely, knowledgeable, skilled and neat.  The granite looks awesome and the details around the windows were perfect. The range and the downdraft fit together just right. 

They were fast and completed our project ahead of schedule, a nice plus. It was important to them that we were totally satisfied and when an issue arose, they always had a solution.  We would use them for future remodeling projects."
5,"Nearly 2 years ago Horizon came out and did a major remodel of our downstairs: kitchen, living room, baseboards & flooring, fireplace, etc. It came out beautifully and we were very happy with the results. Recently we were contacted by Horizon again, checking to see how we felt about the remodel at this point. Well, we had a few concerns (cracked cabinet door, uneven drawers, and a crack in the wall where the pantry was installed), which I shared with Enna and within 2 days she had someone out at our home repairing everything, replacing doors, etc. for NO CHARGE! I am impressed by the customer service of this company; its willingness to take care of us so long out from the job was never expected, but definitely appreciated!"
5,"Horizon Construction did a complete  master bath  remodel for me . They did a great job and stayed on schedule . Their attention to detail and finish work was perfect . When  there was a minor  problem Horizon handled it without question . I would highly recommend  and will use them for my next 
remodel needs   
David Sunde"
5,"Horizon Construction & Remodeling and Eitan the project manager were awesome!
I had several projects done: foundation support, stucco, fascia boards, interior and exterior paint and electrical work. 
All were done professionally and perfectly. 
When unexpected issues arose, they were handled quickly & past expectation !
I would definitely use them again"
5,"Enna, Mark and team did a great job with our full kitchen remodel. We knocked down two walls, did a large support beam and gutted the complete kitchen. Mark suggested we move the sink and re-profile the window, which turned out to be an excellent suggestion. We're very happy with the kitchen and can now entertain without being stuck in a very warm and small ""box"" separated from our guests.

Enna spent a lot of time with us near the end of the project to make sure we were satisfied and that everything was to our liking."
5,The bathroom is beautiful.  It was very stressful and I agonized over each decision.  Mike (project manager) and Robert (contractor) helped with decisions and obtaining materials.  Sol was a great worker.  Mike assured me that everything was fixable when I was catastrophizing.  I had to remind myself of that many times.  I'm so glad it's over!  I would recommend them.
5,"My husband and I are so fortunate to have found Horizon Construction on the Houzz website to help us with our master bathroom remodel.  It was extremely important for us to feel that our contractor was listening, paying attention to detail, and caring about doing a great job.  We got all that in spades in working with Eitan Beznos, our lead designer/contractor, who became a trusted friend through every step of the process.  He consistenty monitored the progress and was in contact with us almost daily to ensure we were satisfied with each installation element along the way, take action to address any problems/issues, update us on what/when to expect next, and offer helpful advice on lingering decisions to be made.  He also even helped find the exact tile from a photo I had shown because he knew it would make us happy not having to settle for something else.  Our design concept for the bathroom really came to life, and it really is a showstopper.  We are amazed at how it looks now and are already planning to contract with Horizon again in a few months for our second bathroom remodel."
5,"Our small, old bathroom was starting to have a lot of issues, so we decided a remodel was in order. We found Horizon Construction online and decided to request an estimate based on the reviews. After our first meeting with Mark, we felt comfortable with him and were impressed with professionalism and attention to detail. Their showroom office had many displays and samples that it made it easier for visual people like me and my wife to envision our design. Our bathroom project had a few twists and turns but Mark was very flexible and committed to customer satisfaction. Mark's workers were easy to work with, and the Horizon Construction staff was kind and willing to help with any questions, issues, or concerns we had. All in all, we are happy we got the bigger bathroom we wanted. I would definitely recommend Horizon Construction for home remodels."
5,"We recently had our master bath remodeled by Horizon Construction.  This was our first experience with a remodel contractor and we didn't really know what to expect.  In our first meeting with Mark he made several suggestions that we decided to go with, such as putting in a light above the tub and adding an electrical outlet on the other side of the sink.  

We really appreciated the fact that Horizon had their own showroom and could make suggestions on combinations of tile, vanities and counter materials.  After going to the big box stores and looking at tile and counter top materials and still not knowing what we wanted we found Mark's input invaluable. 

The workmen all were very good at their jobs.  Steps were taken to protect the floors leading to the bathroom under remodel. Trash was removed in a timely manner.  

There were lots of items we needed to purchase in the first couple of days so that when the walls were rebuilt accommodations could be made for the water supply, drains and electrical.  Decisions had to be made along the way and we answered them the same day, so as to not cause a delay in the schedule.  There were a couple of issues that came up and Horizon addressed them as we went along.  

We were so happy with the result that we hesitated to use the bathroom for a couple of days after completion, we didn't want to mess it up.

Bottom line is we wouldn't hesitate to use Horizon Construction again."
5,"I decided to have a load bearing wall removed, which sounds a lot easier than it is. Horizon was the only company I contacted that didn't waffle on giving me an estimate or insist that I must get ""more"" done in order to be taken seriously.  The office staff was friendly and engaging without being pushy and sales crazy.  I found Eitan Beznos, our assigned contractor, to be friendly,  ethical,  receptive, and always a calming influence in the midst of the project, which , as anyone who's had major construction done  knows, can be a real upheaval of a family's day-to-day life. All the workers involved were pleasant and efficient. I was impressed also by the respect and friendliness between the workers and  Eitan.  I'm very big on customer service, and, to me, a homeowner with a quirky mid century home that needs quite a bit of work, I feel like I've found a reputable company that I can trust and partner with to turn my home into the neighborhood jewel that it can be. I'm looking forward to having Horizon remodel my kitchen later this year."
5,"When i decided to redo my kitchen, i was very nervous about who to hire and trust to do the work.
I'm an older widow with NO experience in all of this. 
after quite a few interviews, well, there was no other choice. 
It was HORIZON CONSTRUCTION & REMODELING all the way.
Michael R. was my project manager and really listened to me and was so helpful in all ways.
Robert and his crew was great. He was always there for me, a giant of a guy in all ways.
I couldn't be happier. They finished in 9 days
AND the price was reasonable. 
It turned out beautiful !
I highly recommend HORIZON!!!

5,"I had a bathroom and bedroom remodeled by Horizon. They were reasonable on the overall cost when compared to other quotes obtained. Eitan Beznos did an excellent job overseeing this project. He expressed a sense of care and always wanted to make sure I was pleased with the work before moving on. Overall, the workmanship was excellent and I was always guided to make the best decision possible on material and installation. Their workers were courteous and knowledgeable. Horizon left both rooms looking immaculate and ready for me to move back in. The end result of this project surpassed my expectations with the project completing on time. I highly recommend Horizon for any home project."
5,"Horizon Construction did a beautiful job on our remodel.  Our our family and friends are raving about the difference between before and after.  There so many nice touches that Mark incorporated in the remodel such as the backsplash in the kitchen and including different stone.  The crew were professional, diligent, hard working and
cleaned up after themselves every day.  Mark was flexible and willing to work on any issue without any complaint.  He is a perfectionist which means he demands high quality from his crew.  He was present during all stages of construction and willing to address any concerns promptly.  I highly recommend him and his team."
5,"Our kitchen and downstairs bathroom in our 30 year old home were beginning to look dated and tired, plus we knew if we tore all down, we’d be able to make better use of the space. We hired Horizon Construction after having interviewed three contractors. We immediately liked Mark Beznos because of his professionalism and seriousness about providing us with the best possible choices regarding layout and design, not to mention that his pricing was reasonable. His initial proposal was very detail oriented and assisted us in approaching all aspects of the project with a good understanding of what would take place. Mark’s crews, from tear down to installation have been on time and easy to work with. They’re efficient and clean up once they have completed their work. Our remodel included not only our kitchen and bathroom, but all of the flooring, baseboards and crown molding in our family room and living room. It’s been a huge project and we couldn’t be more pleased with the result. We have a beautiful modernized downstairs that’s worthy of a professional photo shoot!"
5,"I Found Horizon Construction & Remodeling on line actually for another job but had to shift on the fly when a garage repair issue became more pressing.  Mark came out and reviewed the job with me onsite and followed up with a quote. While not the lowest, I got a good vibe from Mark and chose Horizon for the repair which entailed removing the entire garage floor and much of the underlying soil. The repair looks great and I have received multiple compliments on the completed work. The crews showed up on time and were diligent in their work. Mark and his team are very quick to respond to inquiries which is a big deal to me. I would use them again without hesitation."
5,"I had Horizon install cabinets in my laundry area along with a new sink and also install a ""wet bar"" and media center in my living room.  The quality of the work is excellent and I'm extremely happy. Although my house is small, their work gave it character and everyone that visits comments on how great it looks.  Emma kept me informed the whole way and Mark helped me design everything I wanted.  Thank you!"
5,"We’re writing this review for Horizon Construction & Remolding, Inc. because we found them to be a timely, conscientious and hardworking company that was easy to work with.
The owner Mark Besnos and his staff were very attentive to every detail of our bathroom remodel.
All of the crew members that worked on our bathroom were extremely hard working, always showed up on time and worked long hours to get the job done.
We would highly recommend Horizon Construction for your next construction job.

5,My wife and I are delighted  with our new kitchen.  Horizon did the remodeling in an expeditious and professional  manner.  Their workers were courteous and knowledgeable.  We would highly recommend Horizon to anyone contemplating a remodeling  project.
5,"Horizon Construction completed our remodeling project that involved a full kitchen remodel and structural changes. We could not be more pleased with the results. Mark, Enna, and office staff were highly professional and good communication was made a priority by all. They accommodated all of our change requests.  Mark was mindful that my family was living through the remodel and made efforts to keeping the renovation dust limited to a portion of the house.  The stress of the remodel was lightened by Mark and Enna's empathy and care  as parents of young children as well. Workers sometimes made errors and small damages to areas such as the flooring and walls. Yet with each of these problems, Mark would correct them without question or added charges.  He also took full responsibility for unanticipated problems with the installation of a custom range hood.  In his words: ""I will take care of you.""  In the end, we have a beautiful, high-end kitchen, media room, and more functional laundry room and garage."
4,"Our first home (circa 1951) needed a complete remodel. It had barely been maintained for decades and needed new everything -- plumbing, electrical, HVAC, flooring, windows, doors, etc. We also wanted to update the bathroom, update and expand the kitchen, and remove a load-bearing wall to create an open concept floor plan.

We met with several other shops, and none of them could even envision the finished product or give us a complete estimate. It was a relief when Mike our contractor said at our first meeting, ""Well, the good news is that we can do it all."" And they did. We have been pleased with the overall quality of the work performed, particularly given everything that needed to be done. (The kitchen cabinets, which Horizon supplied, are particularly high quality.) We also appreciated that Mike worked with us to develop a clear pricing estimate, and that other than two unavoidable change orders, the pricing for the job did not change or expand. Horizon allowed us to supply many of our own materials to accommodate our budget as well. (The total price was expensive, but fair, given the short supply of contractors willing and able to do the whole job. We did not have much leverage to negotiate.)

I give Horizon four stars instead of five because we had some communication and timing issues on the job. After we signed the contract in May, the permit submission process was delayed nearly 6 weeks, and while this can be par for the course in some cities, we were not told of the cause for the delay or how the delay was going to impact the project timeline. Instead, we were told and planned on a completion date in early October and were not told until mid-September that the work was actually going to be completed in early November. We had to scramble to extend our temporary lease and find ways to cover the extra costs in our budget.

We also had to push several times for deadlines about what materials needed to be selected and supplied and about payments to be made. We asked for a project timeline, but never received one, and so for several materials, we had to scramble in a day or two to supply them when Mike asked for them ""asap."" Similarly, we offered several times to make progress payments, waited several weeks, and then were asked for large lump sums to cover multiple payments. Both situations caused significant stress.

The lack of a timeline particularly caused some problems when we were selecting a countertop. The pattern we selected was in short supply, and it was not ordered in time for installation before we moved in. To their credit, the owners of Horizon recognized the problem, and they absorbed the cost of a different upgraded countertop, which we appreciated.

And this brings me to my final point -- the owners of Horizon care deeply about their reputation. After they realized some of the timing issues we had experienced, they offered various upgrades to help us get through the rest of the process.

The renovation process is never easy, and frankly, I never want to do it again. But overall, we thought the Horizon crews did a good job."
5,"We were in need of a major master bathroom remodel and were referred to Horizon Construction by a friend who had been extremely please with their master bath remodel.  The owner, Mark, came out on time and gave us many suggestions based on the space we have and an estimate of the cost.  We visited their show room several times to make our selections and were ready to begin.  

The workers all arrived on time and Mark supervised the project from start to finish.  Mark was meticulous in making sure all work was completed to his and our satisfaction.  The result is a beautiful travertine and quartz bathroom that we will enjoy for many years to come.  We highly recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling and will use the company for other remodel projects in the future."
5,"This was my first remodel project and I certainly picked the right company.  A year later I am completely happy with the end result and will use them again.  The schedule was kept and only had 2 change orders which were additional requests from me.  Enna was always in contact with me,  Mark was always available if needed and the trades were all very nice and very professional.  Thank you Horizon Construction .... you have a happy customer!"
4,"I hired Horizon to complete a full remodel of my father’s 3 bedroom/2 bath 1,152 sq. ft. “starter” home (circa 1974) that had never been updated.  Included in the remodel were custom kitchen and bathrooms; new windows and flooring throughout; new A/C and furnace with new ducting; removal of acoustic ceiling; new door (front/fire/closet) replacement throughout; full interior and exterior painting; and updated electrical and plumbing.  The cost:  $95,000.  This amount excludes the cost of all kitchen appliances, vanity/countertops in bathrooms, doors, light fixtures, window coverings, kitchen & bathroom finishes (backsplash tile, cabinet knobs & drawer pulls, sinks, faucets, shower/bath fixtures, mirrors, door handles), new garage door and opener, closet shelving & brackets, as well as required City permits.  

The property was unoccupied throughout the remodel.  Overall, the workmen employed to perform the multitude of tasks involved with this project did a wonderful job!  This was borne out when the house sold 4 days after being listed.  Every showing resulted in comments like “I tried, but I couldn’t find any problems”, “the details were addressed; many remodels miss the mark with the details”, “I’d move in right now if I could!”

As far as the quality of the work goes, I would not hesitate to hire Horizon again.  What I would struggle with, however, are the issues I encountered with project management and administrative matters:

•The project manager I worked with was Mike.  Mike was nice, showed a desire to please his client(s), overall accessible to answer questions, and provided sound and helpful design advice.  Areas where he can improve include writing things down so he won’t forget important issues, reading texts/emails in their entirety to avoid his client’s having to answer questions where information has already been provided in an earlier text/email, and showing more finesse in dealing with a client whose opinion/recollection of events differs with his.  Ultimately, though, Mike’s a good guy and very relatable.
•The front office staff were very pleasant to deal with, and were attentive to issues that arose.  If I had a question, it was usually answered quite promptly.  If I was dissatisfied with something, it was also addressed quite promptly.  Enna (co-owner), Yafa, and Audrey all stand out as being great to work with.  An area that would warrant improvement is the attention to details when it comes to payments.  Client payments should be tracked closely by administration so a client does not have to use their time to provide detailed payment information.

Every construction project will encounter problems and mistakes.  The process has many “moving parts.”  The key factors that helped make this a successful project were that Horizon fulfilled their contractual commitments, took responsibility when mistakes were made, and rectified problems to the satisfaction of their client.

Even after the work was done, and I provided the final sign-off on the project, I encountered an issue that was a result of an understandable mistake on Mike’s behalf.  Enna was so intent on ensuring I was satisfied that she demonstrated her professionalism by rectifying the problem in record time.  She stands by the core philosophy of Horizon Construction & Remodeling to honor their commitment to complete client satisfaction…I appreciate and respect that."
5,"Horizon Construction performed the remodel of  my small master bathroom.  Given the small size, I was expecting any contractor to either price it high or give me second class service.  Horizon did neither.  The price while a bit higher than other bids, was justified by the assignment of a project manager who helped with the design, met me at the home improvement store to pick out the specific tiles and provided exact measurements,  and who provided me with on going supervision of the workers and timely status updates.  

The workers showed up on time and took great care to protect the carpet and the rest of the house.    The work quality was excellent.  I would highly recommend them for the quality of their work.

5,"The project: a kitchen renovation that involved demolishing the old kitchen, building a completely new kitchen in a different location (the old dining area), opening a wall, and building an addition onto the house to add a wet bar

Overall, we had a great experience with Horizon.  They delivered what they said they would, when they said they would, for the price they said it would be.  The work crews were friendly and professional; we were very impressed by their efficiency and the long hours they often worked to complete the project quickly.  As this was our first major renovation, we did sometimes feel some stress about communication (namely knowing when fixtures and decisions were needed from us), but things generally went smoothly.  We are very pleased with the final product and would certainly work with Horizon again."
5,"My wife and I had Horizon remodel two bathrooms at the same time due to a sub floor problem.  The job was performed in a professional ,manner and actually was complete a week early.   The project manager was very professional and assisted us at every step.  Bottom line, I would use this contractor again when the next project arises.  Months after, we required some minor followup repairs and contacted Horizon.  Michael Reppo, the project manager, responded almost immediately.  He came out and inspected and set up the days the crews were to come out and repair.  Really appreciated the prompt and helpful ""AFTER SERVICE"" care given to my wife and I."
5,"This is our 2nd project with Horizon.  First was an awesome kitchen/family room remodel.  This time they did a bathroom remodel, and porcelain tile flooring (living, dining, entry, hall, bath, laundry).  Mark (owner) provided a detailed estimate of cost as well as telling us what our responsibilities were.  There were NO surprise costs.  Mark hires skilled workers (painter, electrician, tile guy, plumber...) who are always on time and polite (no loud talk or radios), able to communicate with me (I speak only English), do meticulous work, and clean up daily before they leave.  Mark is on site almost every day to oversee the quality of work.  Mark and Enna (his wife) are great to work with and responsive to all my texts and emails.  We are going to use Horizon for our next big project (inside staircase redo and new front door).  It's great to have a company you can trust!"
5,Enna and staff are all very helpful. We had a complete demo and remodel of our Master Bath.  It all came out beautifully and could not be happier.
5,"We knew from our experience that this would be a big project, and it would require patience.We needed to remove a weight bearing wall, and reinforce the foundation in three places. This included installing two massive beams in the ceiling to support the roof! This was a Kitchen REBUILD! This old house had the original 1955 yellow tile and linoleum kitchen. We told Mike, our Project Manager that our Prime Concern was the end result. But we wanted him to be as accurate as possible in estimating the start date, and the length of project--and to be HONEST about the predicted time frame. He said they could start in 2-4 weeks as they were so busy--(a good sign). he predicted it would take 3 months to complete, not including holidays. They began within 2 and 1/2 weeks, And they completed our BEAUTIFUL NEW KITCHEN in exactly 3 calendar months which included holidays and weekends!!! We are very happy with the end result, quality materials, and workmanship!!!"
5,"Horizon did a great job with our master bathroom remodel!  We wanted to update the original master bathroom in our home (approximately 20 years old) and they had great ideas to help us realize our goal of a creating a open and modern space.  Their team was very professional, focused on the details, and executed the plan we developed together.  Everyone including the workers, project manager, and owners did a great job.  Thank you Horizon!"
5,"We hired Horizon Construction to demolish our 1950’s kitchen and construct a brand new one. From the beginning they were up front and professional.  We were overwhelmed with all the many choices with design and color.  Since Horizon Construction has a showroom, Mark and Enna were able to help us create the vision we had for our kitchen.  Once the project was underway, we were updated daily by Enna as to when the workers would be here.  We were grateful for their reliability since we were living in our home during the construction. That made this large project much less stressful.  The workers were trustworthy, courteous and respectful of our property.  Throughout the entire project there were only a few issues, as there would be with any project of this magnitude; Mark and his project manager Tal addressed them immediately.  Horizon Construction was a little more expensive than our other bids but you do get what you pay for.  Our kitchen turned out fantastic!  We love it!!"
2,"They came out to bid the job, but when they gave me a price they said that if I did not sign up with them THAT NIGHT then the price would go up by close to 10%, even if it was the following morning.  I explained that I did not do business that way.  Weeks later I asked if they would honor their original price and they quoted me a price that was 15% higher than the original price."
4,"After years of dreaming about remodeling our kitchen, collecting photos from DIY websites and magazines, I was finally able to convince my husband that our 1967 house needed some updating to accommodate our huge family and our hope of “aging in place”. A simple kitchen project became a more extensive downstairs remodel with a new full bathroom and universal shower. We spent months making detailed drawings and lists incorporating what we wanted it to look like. Being life-long DIYers, we entertained the idea of being an owner/contractor but soon realized that the project would involve many structural changes (moving sewer lines, load bearing walls, etc) as well as extensive knowledge of our city’s building codes. In other words, it was beyond our capabilities. We narrowed our search for a contractor to four based on recommendations from neighbors and reviews on the internet, then received estimates and descriptions of the work to be done. Admittedly, we were shocked when all the estimates were almost double what we were anticipating the work to cost… ahh, the price of naivete! While not the least expensive, Mike Roppo, representing Horizon Construction and Remodeling, was the most thorough, knowledgeable and professional of them all.  
Demo started mid-September, final inspection was in mid-February, almost 6 weeks longer than first estimated. We had some glitches and delays along the way:  additional engineering specs, an additional support post, adding a new sheer wall, etc. More time, more money. We were wisely advised to plan on having a 15-20% cushion for unforeseen expenses. Stuff happens!
Electrical, plumbing, framing, drywall, flooring, tile, cabinets, painting, finish carpentry… the crews were great! They all worked hard, cleaned the job site daily, were respectful, communicative-we couldn’t have asked for more from them. Mike was our go-to project manager every step of the way. His code of quality even exceeded ours! We are so grateful to have had him work with us. Mark Besnos  (owner of Horizon Construction) checked in frequently to make sure the work being done met his high standards as well. Mark’s wife Enna and the office staff (Anna and Carolyn) kept us informed as to the work schedule and who to expect on the job site. They were easy to communicate with and always available to address our questions and concerns.
Bottom line, we love our remodeled home and would recommend Horizon Remodeling and Construction…yes, even to our family members."
5,"Recently, we were looking to completely remodel our 1968 master bathroom and create a comfortable, beautiful and functional retreat.  After reading many reviews and viewing several sites, we contacted Horizon Construction and Remodeling to take on the project.  From the first meeting until the final sign off, we found the team to be completely professional, knowledgeable and trustworthy.  During our initial consultation, Mark took our vision and made a beautiful and workable plan that incorporated the custom cabinets and high-end finishes which were consistent with our preferences.  Those plans were transformed into a stunning and comfortable oasis which we enjoy on a daily basis.  When we had questions, changes, or concerns, they were addressed immediately and always to our satisfaction.  During several inspections, our city inspector commented on the outstanding job the team was doing and the rapid pace at which they were completing projects.  The office would keep us informed regarding the daily schedule and as to which teams would be here.  The workman are all skilled craftsmen which shows in their work.  They were respectful, courteous, and meticulous.  Everyday the workspace and surrounding areas were cleaned methodically, taking great care to protect our hardwood floors. This process was first rate from beginning to end, so much so we will be using them in the future to remodel our kitchen.  Quality work, craftsmanship at the highest level, and a professional team, Horizon Construction and Remodeling are top notch and I would recommend them to everyone whether your project is small or large.  Horizon can do it all.  Thank you Horizon for a job well done!"
1,"I called for appointment after reading reviews:
Met with Horizon on January 12, 2016, at least an hour, will be giving me an estimate
Jan. 23, I called office Mgr. Anna to ask why I had not heard back from them, told he was working on other projects to and she would check with him, ask to be called for update. 
Feb. 20, 2016 I went back into my email and found an email from Michael dated Jan. 25, saying Anna said I had called, it takes long due to my circumstance but said he would have it by Wed. with would be (1-27-16). Today is February 20, 2016 and I have not heard from or received any word from Horizon."
5,"We came to Horizon with a home that was in poor shape and needed not only remodeling, but also major infrastructure repair and updates, such as piping, wiring, A/C and heating, etc.  Horizon was proactive in advising us on design, selection and quality of materials, forthcoming with responses to our questions and concerns.  I am not what you'd call an ""easy"" customer, but Horizon was very responsive in resolving the issues that inevitably come up with any project of this scope.  They have also shown that they are willing to follow up on post-project touch-ups, etc; they are determined that we be fully satisfied with the project. 

We are extremely happy in our ""new"" home (it IS like new to us,) and gladly recommend them.  The project was very expensive, due to the damage and poor maintenance accruing over many years, and Horizon was also helpful in assisting us to find financing when our other sources were VERY slow and unhelpful in responding."
4,"Our kitchen was gross. A DIY job by the previous owner on the cheap. Nasty drawers and cabinets that would shed wood particles all over our plates. A poorly placed dishwasher that couldn't open all the way made it completely useless. It needed to go. 

We researched contractors for over 6 months. Interviewed and got bids from 4. Horizon was the most expensive, which was a concern for us - but their strong reviews, experience and overall professionalism gave us peace of mind that was worth the additional cost. 

They worked with our budget to put together a plan that met our needs. After signing with them there were some unexpected things that came up. A few change orders, and our project manager left the company just as we started demo... But throughout, Mark and Enna were helpful and responsive.  

The foreman Effy and his whole crew were great to work with and they made a point to leave the job site neat and tidy at the end of the day.

This was our first major remodel and we're not the most laid back folks... So it was stressful. Despite all of our little worries along the way, Horizon ultimately came through and gave us the beautiful kitchen that we had been dreaming of."
4,"My kitchen project involved completely demolishing my old kitchen and making a brand new one. This also involved removing a load-bearing post and widening the opening to my living room. When I first spoke with Horizon, I had no idea what I wanted to do with the space, other than removing the load-bearing post and opening the doorway. The first time I met with the Project Manager, he showed me pictures of other kitchens, measured my existing kitchen, and sketched out some ideas of how the space could be redone. I appreciated the time he took to help develop how the new space would look. As with any construction project, there were a couple minor delays, and that’s to be expected. As a result, the project took a bit longer to complete than anticipated. What resulted was a beautiful, functional, new kitchen and I am so happy with the outcome. While the Project Manager that I had initially worked with left the company mid-project, the work continued to be carried out as planned. I only met Mark one time toward the latter part of the project, but was told that he had been at my home regularly throughout the project. Enna was my e-mail angel; always replying in a timely manner to my questions and concerns. The foreman that worked at my house was very helpful and kept in communication with me. I love my new kitchen and look forward to many years of enjoyment with family and friends. I would use Horizon again for future home improvement projects."
5,"Hi Enna!Mark was here this morning to check out our Bathroom and we are sad we missed him!  We wanted to give him a great big thank you and a hug!  Please tell him thanks from us!  Thanks to you too Enna, Caroline, Anna, Sam and your whole crew!  You all have made this experience very pleasant!  All of you have been kind, considerate and made us feel like we mattered!  We appreciate you!We absolutely love our bathroom!  It's beautiful and works so much better for us!  I have been posting pictures and telling friends and family about the whole experience!  I have one lady who may redo her bathrooms and another today that asked for your name to give to her daughter!  We will continue to brag about you and our bathroom!Thank you again!Marlene and Dennis Baker"
5,"This was the fourth project that Horizon Construction has done for us. They did a complete remodel of our kitchen, both bathrooms, and removed popcorn ceilings and repainted two family rooms. This project involved removing a chimney that sat perpendicular from the wall in the middle of our family room. They did the complete demo in one day, sealing off the room with plastic to cut down on dust as much as they could. Very impressed! They had to patch the roof, patch the ceiling, and the wall. The very creative part was what to do with the floor area where the chimney base had been. The tile on the floor surrounding the area was discontinued so we were able to find a similar tile that their amazing tile guy laid at a diagonal and it looks fantastic!!! As I have always stated before, Horizon is not perfect (let me know if you do find a contractor who does perfect work the very first time!!). But they will always make sure you are completely satisfied with the work before leaving, no matter what. I respect that and that is why they have come back to do work at our house four times!!!"
5,"Master Bath Remodel.  This is the third time we hired Horizon.  We were very happy with their previous work (a kitchen remodel and replacing all the crown molding and baseboards throughout the house) so we had no hesitation in hiring them again.   Mark came over and we talked through our wish list for the bathroom remodel.  He offered useful suggestions and came back to us quickly with a detail plan and a price.  Mark met with us twice at the tile store to help us make our selections.  The whole project then proceeded very smoothly.  Enna was quite helpful along the way in keeping us up to date and on top of all the decisions that had to be made.  Workers were there every day and they were all well-skilled, polite and neat.  There were a few issues that came up, but Mark and Enna and the workers always heard our concerns and made sure that everything was always completed to our complete satisfaction.   The bathroom turned out beautifully with clean lines and gorgeous materials, just like we dreamed of."
5,"Description Of Work: 

Initially called them for some upstairs floor repair, tile and carpet replacement throughout house, including replacement of baseboards. Upon removal of carpet, found some cracks indicative of foundation damage.  City engineer required geologic report which contractor arranged for, and contractor worked with city to settle on required remediation, (significant concrete footing additions and drainage) which was responsible for 2/3 of total cost. Contractor also replaced stair banister and rail and installed new front door.


Member Comments: 


The project timeline was extended significantly by the discovery of the need for foundation work and the involvement of the City in that process.  Otherwise, all the work of the contractor was excellent, timely and efficient.  Every day the worksite was left clean and the house was livable through entire process.  Workers were very skilled and eager to please and did excellent work. We had purchased new lighting for the house and they arranged for an electrician to do the installation for us.

Omri, the project manager, was excellent at keeping us apprised of scheduled work times and visits, and with suggestions or variations of our ideas to enhance the house further. The business owner, Mark, was on site from time to time, including at the foundation specialist's initial visit. Occasionally additional work was recommended, generally for completion of the remodeling, or as recommended for long term benefit.

Horizon's quality of work is excellent, they are honest, and the price of the work is fair. I can not overstate my satisfaction with my relationship with them."
5,"My husband and I started our remodeling journey in February 2015. At first we wanted to just update our kitchen. But after a while we decided to expand the project and remove the walls between the kitchen, dining room and family room and create one big open space. We worked with a construction company for more than 3 months. We met with them many times and finally we decided they were not up to the task. 
My husband found Horizon from the Angie’s list and he setup an appointment.  When Mark came to our house he explained the process to us. They would do the the plans, get them approved  by the city and then we could use him for construction or go with another companies. He gave us a reasonable price for the drawings. He also showed us many pictures from different projects he had worked on. Projects in which he had moved or removed walls. That was important to me. Horizon move very quickly and we had  approved plans in less than 3 weeks. Our project was not just upgrading rooms. There was serious structural change we needed to do. Removing all 3 load bearing walls and adding 2 huge beams across the house. It still scares me when I think about it. 
The construction project was supposed to take 3 months. The crews were in our house almost every day. And they worked really hard. The job site was kept clean and organized. We had a payment chart so we paid each piece after it was done. Demolition, material, footers, etc. I never forget the day we came home after a 3 day trip and saw the walls completely gone, beams up there and for the first time we could see our new space. It was very exciting. There were no big surprises but a few issues did come up but Mark and his team explained them and we work through them easily. Mark responded to all of our concerns and questions and was  always available.
The project finished just under 3 months and we are extremely happy with the result and experience. Mark and his team are true professionals. I also want to add that Enna was very helpful in the entire process keeping us up-to-date. Horizon made this project look easy. But I know it was not. They basically took our 1970 old, outdated and dark house and brought it to year 2015 making it look bright and open. Thank you Horizon Construction"
5,"We chose Horizon Construction for  a master bathroom remodel. The company was very professional, the project manager was extremely organized. Workers showed up each day when scheduled and left everything clean at the end of the day. The owner always did a final inspection. The final product was beautiful! We will definitely use them again for the next remodel."
5,"The project went smoothly from beginning to end.  Omri, the project manager, was very helpful and patient in helping choose the tile and fixtures for the bathroom.  Tal and his crew were very good at their jobs, whether it be the demo or the plumbing or tiling. Enna in the office kept us informed of the schedule which was very helpful.  The end result is a beautiful bathroom that we love!  Thank you Horizon!"
5,"Not many people would describe a kitchen renovation as a pleasant experience, but my husband and I would. 

Ours is a 50s tract home, and we wanted to update the small kitchen without it looking out of synch with the rest of the house, what we like to call ""mid century modest,"" AND we wanted to incorporate our vintage white Wedgewood range. We're a bit eclectic in our taste and were looking for someone who ""got"" our vision...kind of mid century without the kitsch or the ultra moderne style, with maybe a little Craftsman thrown in for good measure. It was a challenge to find that someone in our area.

We initially got quotes from two other contractors who were willing to do what we thought we wanted. When we met with our third candidate, Mark Besnos of Horizon Construction & Remodeling, and described our desire to, for instance, relocate the sink, Mark said ""You don't want to do that."" At first we were taken aback, then saw the wisdom when he explained why moving the sink would be a big mistake. He was absolutely right, and we hired him on the spot.

From Day 1 we were impressed by the steady communication with the office (run by his lovely wife, Enna) letting us know what to expect from day to day and addressing any questions or concerns we might have. We were equally impressed by the attention to detail and overall craftsmanship performed by each member of Mark's crew: every single detail was honed to perfection...cabinetry, floor tile, backsplash, paint, installations, even cleanup. A few changes were accommodated without undue stress or expense. 

We did have one unfortunate surprise when the load-bearing wall with the pass-through between the dining area and kitchen turned out to need reinforcement due to the work of the ""handyman"" who had owned the house before us. He had actually cut the support beams to create the pass-through, left them dangling, and then just closed up the wall. It's a miracle the house didn't fall down during an earthquake! So even though the fix meant a little more money than we anticipated, it was absolutely necessary and we now have a safer, more stable home. And the pass-through looks stunning! 

I did want to mention that the Caesarstone ""Concrete"" countertop is NOT suitable for a family with kids as it shows every handprint and drip. I failed to read the caveat on the Caesarstone Care & Maintenance page that clearly states: ""Please understand that Honed, Concrete and Motivo™ finishes will require more daily maintenance than our polished finishes. Since there is more exposed surface area with these finishes, metal marks, fingerprints and other signs of daily living will show on these materials."" Bottom line: I've become a bit obsessive with a micro fiber towel always at hand.

Horizon is a small, family-owned business run by and staffed by kind, caring, and competent professionals each of whom goes the extra mile to provide complete customer satisfaction. Even though Mark had to leave the country unexpectedly, the job stayed on track during his absence and was finished within the expected timeframe. 

It's no wonder Horizon has so many positive reviews, and we will definitely be using them again when we're ready to tackle our outdated bathrooms."
5,"We had no intention of redoing our 58-year-old kitchen (we had put up with it for so long) until Anna from Horizon called one day.  I never appreciate sales calls, but Anna was so pleasant that I scheduled a consultation with Mark.  He was very thorough and helpful.  Before we knew it, our kitchen was being completely renovated.  Everyone at Horizon was very patient with us as we chose materials and I invariably worried about everything!  Mark and Enna kept reassuring me that it would all be fine, and they would take care of everything.  And they did!  They redid our kitchen and pantry from top to bottom.  They also replaced the floor in the entry and guest bathroom, and replaced all the door and floor moldings.  Their workers were skilled, very polite and respectful, and cleaned up after themselves every afternoon before they left.  The finished kitchen is gorgeous!  Exactly what I wanted.....simple, clean, and warm!  It is a perfect kitchen for this house.  Any issues, large or small, that arose were taken care of to our satisfaction. Mark, Enna and the rest of their office and construction crew were wonderful.  I'm actually going to miss them!  I would not hesitate to recommend them, and I will not hesitate to call them for future projects."
5,"We are very pleased with our new master bathroom! It is gorgeous! The bathroom was gutted and Horizon replaced the tiled walk-in shower and bathroom floor, installed a custom vanity and two huge framed mirrors, and all new plumbing and electrical fixtures. They also scraped, textured and painted our master bedroom ceiling. Mark was creative in helping us with design ideas and made sure all the details that we envisioned were taken care of to our satisfaction. Enna was in the office and guided us through the process, answering any questions or concerns we had along the way. She was knowledgeable herself, or she referred our questions to Mark or Tal, our foreman. Communication was quick and constant...either by email or phone. All the people who worked on our project were courteous, competent, and kept our home as clean as possible, tidying up each day before leaving. Our project started on time and finished on time, with people working every day. We always felt we were in very good hands. With anyone else we might have had a nice bathroom, but with Horizon we have a BEAUTIFUL bathroom!"
5,"Services provided: Bathroom remodels, bathroom addition, tongue-in-groove ceiling, built-in cabinetry  around fireplace, pergola, fencing. 
My husband and I are extremely happy with the work performed by Horizon Construction. All the built-ins and cabinetry work are beautiful. The bathrooms are the envy of our friends and neighbors. Every team of construction specialists that came into our house took great pride in their work. And outside, the pergola and new fencing are beautiful as well. Indeed, our house could be featured as a 'before and after' transformation in a designer magazine. With a project of this magnitude, there are bound to be surprises behind the walls. What was so great about Horizon was that they stepped up to the plate and went above and beyond to resolve every issue. Customer service is not just lip service with them, they take it to heart. Their reputation as a premier remodeler is very important to them. Our project manager, Omri Nave, was professional and extremely responsive, as was Enna Eskin in the office. 
As a side note I should add that we were originally going with another contractor recommended by friends, but after many weeks and still no firm bid from that contractor, I searched for a contractor on Angie's List.  Omri from Horizon came out immediately and met with my husband at the house we had just purchased (I was in Arizona at the time). Omri worked until very late that night to prepare the detailed bid, and my husband signed on the dotted line without hesitation.
It is never easy to go through a remodel project of this size, especially while you are living in the house. But we are so grateful to the Horizon team for their professionalism and dedication to customer satisfaction. What few issues came up were resolved quickly and without hassle. We would recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling without reservation."
5,"I have never written a review about any company before mainly because I have never worked with a company that delivered what it promised.  That ended when we contracted Horizon Construction and Remodeling. Not only was the work done beautifully but was finished within the timeline we set, and they delivered as promised.
I can't say enough about this company.  Mark Besnos and his crew are without a doubt the best contractor and professionals we have ever worked with.  When we first met with Mark we knew he was the right guy.  He works within your budget and has so many great ideas that help with your design decision making.   Also, behind every successful company there is a very professional office staff.  Enna Eskin makes sure that all the paper work is done and expedited on time.  She's great to work with and is there to answer any questions you might have.  You feel like family with this company because they take such good care of you.  
Mark oversees every aspect of the project himself. He arrived everyday before and after his workers finished their work and walked through the project and inspected it.  If something didn't meet his approval he would tag it and have them redo it.  He is a perfectionist and it shows when the project is done.  His crew cleaned up every night after they finished their work and left us with a clean house to live in and that was not an easy task to do.  We remodeled out Master Bath, put new granite and a backsplash in the kitchen, installed wood floors throughout the house, and a beautiful new staircase.
If you are looking for the Rolls Royce of Contractors, don't look any further.  Horizon Construction and Remodeling is the company for you want.  You won't be disappointed."
4,"When we bought our home, we knew we wanted to take on a massive remodel/upgrade. We interviewed and gathered estimates from four Southern California general contractors, all of them coming in with high ratings and reviews from Houzz, Yelp, Angie’s List and BBB. Horizon did not come in the lowest bidder, however, their professionalism, conduct of business, their interaction with their clients and attention to detail was what made them stand out from the others. 

Undergoing a project as big as ours (a complete remodel of master bath, all new windows and doors, new flooring throughout the house, a complete new stair case, opening up a room, blowing out wall, painting the whole interior, changing out hardware, adding a pergola and incorporating a 15' bi-fold door) there are going to be bumps and unforeseen turns in the road. 

From relocating an outlet for daily convenience to installing a new header beam to comply with city permitting, no task was too small for Horizon the scope of our remodeling project. Their team of designers and contractors walked us through picking out our materials, gave us experienced advice and listened to our dream home vision. What we originally though we wanted or thought about forgoing, Horizon helped us plan and design around our budget and keep the big picture in perspective. At the end of the six-month project we were very impressed with how Horizon handed all the different types of issues and challenges that arouse. 

This house is our ""20 year home"" where will be raising our children, having family gatherings and hosting countless friends. We have now lived the home for three months (construction free) and we are very happy with the quality of service and out come of our remodel done by the team at Horizon Construction and Remodel."
5,"I hired Horizon for an excavation and construction project for a second living unit on my property. They made the whole process so smooth. Omer, the project manager and designer, was extremely helpful. I felt like I was his only priority. He made the hardest stage of my project so easy. I have actually gained a friend from the process that we went through and him making it so enjoyable. There was not a single struggle even in the inevitable unforeseen obstacles. He made them dissolve. In a way, I want to have another project just so I can work with them all over again."
5,"Working with Mark and Enna from Horizon Construction and Remodeling was a great experience.  They were professional, punctual, precise, and communicative.  Each day work was performed, their workers made sure to leave as little impact or disturbance in the area.  The work done is of high quality - they were able to transform our bathroom out of the 1960s into something modern, clean, and functional.  We were in constant communication via text/phone/email.  They were very patient when we were picking out our cabinet colors - leaving us samples to ensure that we got the exact color and style we wanted.  And of the three contractors we bid the job out to, there price was very reasonable.  I appreciated the personal touch they add to their service - always making sure that we were satisfied with each step of the process.  We will definitely be calling Mark and Enna again when it comes time to get our kitchen out of the 60s."
5,"The project included ceiling repair and remodeling in entry hall, dining room and living room.  The process was easy, efficient, and included myself throughout the steps.  Pricing was fair, timing was accommodating, and I am most pleased with the results.  Omer Barel was terrific and made me feel that I was in most capable, confident hands.  Overall, a good experience, and I would recommend them to anyone."
5,"This is the kitchen my wife has been waiting for since we bought our house 16 years ago.  She loves the final product!  To be honest, we were not planning on spending this much on our kitchen remodel; however, we chose Horizon based on over 100 reviews and our experiences with other contractors in the past.  So, based on the reviews, we knew we were going to spend more money than the average kitchen remodel.  Having dealt with several projects over the years, I also was aware we were going to go over budget along with having some challenges along the way.  We did have a couple of issues that looked like they were going to go sideways, but Horizon listened to and took care of those issues to the best of their ability each time--and, to good effect.  I spent the most time communicating with Enna--almost always over the phone or by E-mail--and found her easy to work with.  I had read reviews that said some things about Enna being difficult to get along with, but I did not find that to be the case.  Keep in mind, all of the reviews that had those comments in them did not actually have work done by Horizon.  Enna was there to help solve a couple of problems by making certain one of her crew got to our house, by coming to our house herself, or by, for example, crediting us $741 for the ceiling drywall replacement [because I thought we did not need to replace it].  There were several Horizon employees that helped the remodeling experience [often stressful] more tolerable.  Horizon arranged to have a Porta-Potty outside our house so the workers would not have to use our bathrooms.  They also arranged the appointments with the city for the permit inspections.  There were some communication problems at times; however, I soon learned that going straight to Enna was the best way to solve any problems that cropped up.  If anyone wonders why I rated Horizon a ""B"" for price I have a simple answer:  their are not the low-end bid--they are likely closer to the higher-end bid.  But, you get what you pay for.  So, the ""B"" is to give prospective customers a heads-up that you ought to plan accordingly.  That said, we chose an expensive (beautiful) piece of granite, had special space-saving aspects added to our cabinets, glass-tile backsplash, under-counter lighting, travertine tile floor, and more.  There were no significant surprises except . . . WE REALLY LOVE OUR NEW KITCHEN!  However, I would say that was more of an expectation than a surprise."
5,"Due to a water leak issue, I had to remodel my kitchen and part of the family room.  After many interviews and careful consideration I selected Horizon Construction and Remodeling who, in addition, was highly rated by customers on Angie’s list.  It proved to be a very good decision!  Mr. Ormi Nave was my Project Manager whose expertise guided me through design, style and material selections.  The cabinet maker, electrician, plumber, painter/drywall, tile installer were all excellent at their craft!  Upper management also reviewed on-site work excellence and progression.  The Horizon team maintained a high level of professionalism and integrity throughout the entire project.   I highly recommend Horizon for your next project!"
5,"Our project consisted of a complete kitchen remodel (including soffit removal and fireplace facelift) along with new flooring and cabinets in the bathroom and laundry room.  We also replaced the flooring in the entry way as well as the coat closet and linen cabinet.    Horizon Construction was not the least or most expensive quote we gathered.  One deciding factor for us was that Mark offered ideas and suggestions during the quoting process.  We had a general concept that we were shooting for but this was our first kitchen remodel so we were also looking for expert advice on layout, materials and design.  Response time to questions and change orders was quick.  As with any work in an older home, surprises occurred and adjustments were made throughout the project which affected the timeline and cost.  Mark walked us through these obstacles as he knew we were detail oriented.  We did experience some discrepancies in what was agreed upon with Mark and what was executed by the crew.  These mistakes were all quickly fixed at no additional cost to us (other than time lost).  We had an assigned foreman for some of the trades but ultimately Mark acted as our main point of contact for everything.  The crew was professional, hard-working and respectful.  We were not pleased with the semi-custom cabinet installers.  Horizon’s custom cabinet maker who worked on some of our other pieces was much better with a higher quality product.   Final cabinet details were fixed and completed in a timely manner by him.  Overall, we were very pleased with the final results!"
5,"Kitchen Remodel.
Horizon just completed a gut rehab remodel of our kitchen (which included removing a wall) and we were very pleased with the whole process. This was our first remodeling project and we didn't quite know what to expect going into it. We worked primarily with Omri who did an absolutely wonderful job keeping everything on track and helping us each step of the way. He truly went above and beyond to ensure that our needs were met and that we were happy with the end result. The remodel was completed in a timely manner and each of the work crews that came in were courteous, professional and cleaned everything up at the end of each day. Another plus for us was that Horizon was all inclusive. We didn't have to choose a separate place to buy/install the cabinets from and another for the counters, etc. They handle everything which makes it so much easier!"
5,"Horizon Construction did an incredible job on our kitchen from day one!  Omri and Mark have been there each step of the way with great ideas and suggestions and then they bring fantastic workers in to make them a reality.  From countertops to cabinets to floors and plumbing they have the best of the best working for them.  We had a kitchen wall that needed to be removed and needless to say my wife and I were worried about tearing our house apart!  Horizon managed the process with precision and now the house looks like it was originally built without that wall. I can't say enough good things about this team - they are professional, diligent, responsible, fairly priced and they always do what they say they are going to do.  We have had a couple of issues along the way but Horizon demonstrated their commitment to customer service each time something came up.  They take responsibility and fix issues as they arise without any questions.  I would highly recommend Horizon to friends and family and encourage anyone considering a remodel to use them."
5,"Removed bathtub in master suite and constructed a walk-in shower, added a second water line to accommodate the shower heads, constructed a pocket door to separate the bedroom from the dressing room.  Electrical included led lights in my home office and other electrical work,  installed new faucets in the kitchen and 3 bathrooms and painted...

I chose Horizon Construction and Remodeling (HCR) because of their excellent presentation and fabulous reputation on Angie’s List. This was a wise decision because HCR proved to be an ethical, caring and efficient company. My original remodeling job was to remove the bathtub in the master suite and install a walk-in shower. During the remodeling, I added additional electrical, plumbing changes and repairs to my home. The HCR crew held my hands throughout the whole process. The office staff called me frequently to check how I was doing and to make sure everything was going okay.  The workers, in my home, were hardworking, fast and clean. There were a couple of hiccups with the job but I was very impressed with the prompt, same day, actions taken to correct any problems. In addition, all inspections were passed on first try. The price was reasonable for all of the work done and some things were not even charged. I whole heartedly recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling and I will call them again for my next remodeling project.

5,"Our contractor was Mark Besnos.  Mark is definitely who you want doing your remodeling.  Mark is fastidious.  His attention to detail was unbelievable.  As picky as he is, I wouldn't want to be his wife.  As with any job, there were things that needed tweaking.  Mark made sure everything was absolutely perfect.  We had an issue with the stainless steel tiles for the backsplash.  After installing it was obvious that some of the tiles had a different finish (brushed finish instead of shiny finish).  Mark had the tile company come to the house.  He made sure the issue was fixed.  His office staff, Enna, and Anna, were terrific.  There was never a time when I called that I didn't get a hold of Mark, Enna, or Anna.  The best part, everyone who has come to see the kitchen, even all the subcontractors, complimented us on the kitchen.  It should be on the cover of Better Homes & Gardens.  Sherry."
5,"There are already the well-acknowledged passages associated with life; birth, marriage, divorce, graduation, the new job. I’d like to add one more—remodeling.

The decision to embark upon the renovation path, in most cases, involves entering into a relationship with a contractor. Selecting one, in many respects, is only slightly less important than say choosing a spouse or deciding to have children. Remodeling your home can be a journey filled with uncertainty, havoc and frustration as you work toward the beautiful surroundings you envisioned those many months earlier. As the old knight who guarded the room of chalices in a scene from the movie, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, mused, “Choose wisely.” 

Fortunately, we did when we contracted with Mark of Horizon Construction. You want your contractor to be competent, trustworthy, and reliable. Mark was all of these and more. 

Mark takes a personal interest in his work. He is on the site much of the time ensuring that his workers are doing their best. When things go wrong, he makes sure they get fixed. Like any relationship, there will be disagreements or misunderstandings, but Mark handled them in a professional and sincere manner. The bottom line here is that Mark wants his customers to be happy.

I could relate several episodes of Mark’s commitment to customer satisfaction, but the one that meant the most to us was when we had a sewer line back up into the house (no fault of Mark’s). Out of panic, I called Mark and he came out immediately and with his foreman worked on clearing the line. He didn’t have to do that. He could have told us to call a plumber and gone back to what he was doing.

I highly recommend Horizon Construction and Mark as your choice for your remodel project. You will have chosen wisely."
4,"My initial experience with Enna when I first called to set up an appointment was very professional and pleasant. We set up an appointment to meet with Mark, the GC, within 2 weeks of the call. Mark was professional, listened well to what we had in mind, augmented these visions with his own excellent design ideas, and made us feel very confident at the first meeting that Horizon was likely the best choice for us. After meeting with several other GCs over the next few weeks, Horizon was in our top 3 finalists, and we made the choice to move forward with them based on our feelings of confidence that they really understood what we wanted to do. Horizon was not the lowest bidder, nor were they the highest.
 After confirming with Mark our choice to move forward with Horizon, we met with him again to go over in more detail the project scope and timeline and to sign paperwork for the plan development. The initial project timeline was identified as 10-12 weeks. Soon after this meeting, he swiftly had plans drawn up for the architectural changes to our kitchen and living room and submitted them for approval. Expecting approval to take several weeks, Mark suggested we start working on the master bathroom remodel so as not to lose momentum. During Master Bath demolition, Mark identified some unanticipated framing work after the walls were stripped. Although I was not expecting this, we compromised on the cost of addressing this work, which set the tone for addressing unexpected work going forward. Work on the Master Bath went longer than expected based on some changes to scope as well as some permit hang-ups, but the finished product was exactly what we wanted.
 Approval of the Kitchen\Living Room plans came back quicker than expected (in a few days as opposed to weeks), and work on the kitchen and living room commenced and ran concurrent with the work on the master bathroom. This work involved removing walls between the galley kitchen, the den/4th bedroom, the living room and the dining area with the ultimate design goal being a great room spanning all of these areas. Due to removing load-bearing walls, support beams had to be installed in the attic and 6 foot deep underpinnings had to be dug and placed in a several areas. Although the inside of our house was unrecognizable, the work proceeded on schedule for the most part. During the project, we did make some adjustments to overall scope (not changing planned work, just adding new work to overall scope, e.g., originally we had no intention of touching the fireplace, or any of the bedrooms; we made some decisions midstream to have Horizon redo the fireplace
 and floor and paint all of the bedrooms based upon design ideas from Mark). Change management on these items (and other items) was handled well by Enna. After the Master Bathroom completed, Horizon started on the guest bathroom remodel, which involved the following:

 > Removal of HVAC unit from closet adjacent to the bathroom.
 > Demolition of walls between HVAC closet, bathroom, and adjacent coat closet.
 > Installation of new HVAC unit in the attic.

 Utilizing the square footage from the HVAC closet and the coat closet effectively doubled the square footage of the guest bathroom allowing us to convert it into a full bath with double vanity (from a ¾ bath). This was the last aspect of the project to complete.Considering that we lived in the house through the project (with the exception of 3 non-continuous weeks for vacation), we were eager to see the project complete, and we are extremely happy with the results. Horizon saw the vision we had for transforming the interior of our 55 year old ranch style house into something more modern and beautiful, and they executed on it.
 The only negative thing I feel compelled to note is that the crew was not considerate about keeping the work site clean: Paint brushes were rinsed out in the plants in the front yard; razors, cuttings from wood, discarded pieces of wire, food wrappings, etc continually littered my front yard and driveway. I asked Mark and Enna to address with their crew at least two times, however it didn't fix the situation and I ultimately ended up cleaning up after the crew. This may seem petty or perhaps I am naïve about a project of this magnitude, but it made me feel disrespected as a customer for my concerns about this to go effectively ignored.
 Lastly I have to say that, Horizon Construction (Mark, Enna and their whole crew) we're extremely friendly and nice throughout the entirety of the project. Never once did I second guess my choice. By the end of the project, I still felt comfortable that we had made the best choice. Since the completion of the project, Horizon has cheerfully addressed any issues that have come up."
5,"We hired Mark and his team to come and install Marble flooring in our formal dining/living room. They were quick, efficient and very clean. He was very thorough about what the layout was going to look like, making sure to ask if I had any changes to the design. It came out looking gorgeous. Enna was also very personable and thorough. Confirmations for everything was emailed and discussed so there were no ""surprises"" or hiccups and misunderstandings. Overall they did a great job."
5,"We have been working with Horizon Construction for many years now. Their projects are beautiful and we are proud to be a part of it. They are detail oriented and give close attention to every aspect of their work. Enna & Mark have been a pleasure to work with, easy going and pleasant .

5,"When we first met Mark Besnos (owner) at our house, he asked a lot of questions, offered suggestions, and was not at all afraid to offer his opinion when he thought we were wrong (this can be off-putting I suppose, except after you work with Mark for a while you will come to appreciate that he really knows what he is doing and you should listen to him!).  Of the five bids we received for this work, Mark's was by far the most detailed and the only one that covered all of the details we discussed.  Not the cheapest bid by far, but when I went back and looked at the holes in the other bids I had no doubt they would have change ordered us to death and I would have ended up spending the same or more likely more.

The work started promptly and once started stayed pretty much on schedule throughout.  Enna always kept us informed when things were going to be done, so there were never any major surprises.  There were problems along the way as there always are in remodeling, and this is where Horizon really shines in my opinion - Mark always said ""Don't worry, we will take care of it"", and they always did.  Every time.  If you have had remodel work done before you know how rare this is.  It's the way a business should be run, unfortunately many contractors don't seem to get it.

We are extremely pleased with the work they did.  In particular, our master bath which has all new cabinetry, onyx counter, travertine floors and shower walls, frameless glass shower and rainfall shower are spectacular.  I remark to my wife when I get out of the shower in the morning that I feel like I'm staying at the Ritz Carlton! 

Thanks Mark and Enna.  You guys are great!"
5,"We have working with Horizon for many years, they give every customer personalized attention and they have an eye for detail work. They are experts in the area of remodeling with an eye for fresh ideas in the design field. Trusted reliable service, It doesn't get any better in customer service!"
5,"The remodeling included the demolition and reconstruction of 2 bathrooms. It included converting the guest bath to a walk-in shower with tile and a frameless glass enclosure. The job included replacing the vanities, countertops, installing porcelain tile throughout, new bathtub installed in the master bath, changes to the plumbing and all new fixtures including sinks, exhaust fans, and lighting. 
We selected Horizon Construction & Remodeling because of the good ratings they received from customers who had work done by them. The cost was higher than some other quotes I received but I was concerned about the quality of the workmanship and considered the customer satisfaction ratings Horizon received from their customers. As it turned out, the work was completed on time, within budget and the quality of the work was excellent. We are very satisfied with how everything turned out. As in any project, issues arise but they were quickly resolved with no excuses. Mark inspected the work as it progressed and Enna communicated with us every step of the way so there were no surprises. They got a building permit from the City of Huntington Beach for the remodeling as we requested and we had no problems passing any phase of the inspection process. We would recommend them to our friends."
5,"Added 215 sq.ft. to Master Bedroom including enlarged and remodeled Master Bathroom, siting area, and walk-in closet.
Member Comments: 
This was the second project we've contracted with Horizon (first was a kitchen remodel in 2009). Work was completed on schedule, within budget, and met all our expectations. Horizon kept us apprised of the progress by email (e.g. ""Tomorrow they will install the counter top""). They stayed on the job until every item on our ""Punch List"" had been addressed to our satisfaction. Mark and Enna are a very nice couple and are a joy to work with. When unforeseen problems arise (and they always do), Enna's voice over the phone is very calming and reassuring and indeed all problems were resolved. Mark walks through the project frequently and will spot items that don't meet his expectations and see that they are corrected without us having to say a word.
We will definitely use them again for our next project."
5,"Horizon had to take down two walls and put In a beam to create our open layout kitchen. It was a huge job and we took three bids. But the other two bids wouldn't take out the walls, and we didn't want to settle. Mark said yes right away and brought an engineer who gave the okay. Every change easy passed by us for approval and the work was done very well. Issues we had after the remodel were handled. Someone visiting said it looked like it was always there, but my husband and I know what a huge transformation this kitchen was to our house and our lives. Enna was a great lifeline through the whole project which was completed before the estimated time."
5,"Complete remodel of kitchen, demo of old exterior concrete stone and fireplace. Replaced with stack stone. Installation of wood flooring. 


We went through several contractors (6 to be exact) before we found the right one. From the moment we called Horizon Construction, Enna made use feel very comfortable. We explained to Enna what we wanted and what we were looking for. She stated that Mark Besnos would be out to see us and see what he can do. Mark who is the owner and designer gave us a very beautiful vision of what our kitchen would look like. We felt at ease with Mark and fell in love with his ideas. We have finally found our contractor. We only had signed a contract with Horizon to remodel our kitchen but asked mark what he could also do with the exterior of the house and gave us another beautiful vision. He recommended to remove the old concrete stone around the house and by the fireplace and replace it with stack stone. The final out come is amazing. We also wanted to remove the old carpet and install wood flooring and gave him the job as well and they did an excellent job of installing our wood flooring. Our overall experience with the Horizon Construction crew was very good. The crew was very polite, on time, and cleaned up after them selves at the end of the work day. Mark and his foreman Elly were there almost everyday to ensure that the projects were getting done as we have specified and would correct any issues we had with some of the installations. Given the amount of time we gave Horizon Construction they finished the job as specified and did a beautiful job. We have gotten many, many compliments on our house and can only thank Mark, Enna, Elly and the Horizon Construction crew for all there hard work and for making our experience and great one."
5,"Just want to say that we are extremely happy with the kitchen remodel that Horizon Construction completed for us. Our home was built in the late 1940s and was really showing its age. We wanted to have an open floor plan that incorporated the kitchen, dining room and living room. We had some ideas and a budget for what we were willing to spend. Mark took our ideas and make them come to life! He has an eye for design and style and a commitment to quality and detail. He and Enna are both committed to making sure their clients are satisfied and happy.
We took out a load bearing wall between the old kitchen and living room and now have a wonderful large room. This was the second kitchen remodel I have lived through and this one was definitely the best. Mark said he would be finished in 9 weeks and he was! Their crew worked Monday through Friday and showed up every day.  Enna called daily to keep us up to date, making sure we had appliances and spec sheets ready for the crew and making sure all our questions were answered. 
Mark was at the house every morning to direct the crew and attend to any details. He made sure that everything that we couldn’t see was done correctly as well as attending to details like overhead lamp and outlet placement and overall design functionality and appearance. Mark had the placement of the lamp over our dining table changed several times (without our knowing) until he was satisfied that it would be in the right place – and it was!
The crew was absolutely great. They arrived at about the same time every morning, went right to work but were always patient and answered any questions we may have had. The absolute best thing is that they cleaned up their work area every day without fail. They put up plastic so construction dust in the rest of the house was kept to a minimum which I really appreciated.
If you are wondering if Horizon is the company for you – our answer is YES! Do it, you will be very happy with the result. We sure are!"
5,"We chose Horizon Construction because of Mark's vision for our bathrooms in our initial consultation. Our bathrooms are rather small, and we had a few ideas of what we wanted before Mark came over, but he quickly suggested what would and wouldn't work based on his extensive experience and design knowledge. Mark is very good at being straightforward with you on what needs to be done for the space you have to renovate. Some might consider his straightforwardness slightly abrupt, but don't let that put you off - he's very good at what he does and has a passion for his work and the details, and he knows the work his crew does is a reflection of himself and his company (as he should).

We mainly interacted with Enna, Horizon's business manager and design consultant, from that point forward, though Mark did visit the project regularly. He also made himself available at any time should you want to go over any details with him. Enna's responsiveness and regular communication is a big reason we are as happy as we are with how the project turned out. Not many contracting companies have someone like Enna to be your customer service rep., design consultant, project coordinator, complaint department, etc. Enna is very responsive, competent, nice, and professional, and made the 2+ months of having workers in our home a tolerable (and almost pleasant :-) ) experience. 

Day one, Enna and Mark met us at the tile store to sign the contracts and help us pick out flooring, countertops, and glass borders, which was incredibly helpful. Work began quickly afterwards, and the crew was at our house just about every week day for around 2 months. Each crew member was very nice, respectful, hard working, and we trusted them implicitly to work and lock up after themselves while we were at work. Coming home from work each day was an exciting event; seeing progress was a treat and they always cleaned up after themselves each day. 

Mark visited the site regularly and corrected any issues and small details he found, and listened to any concerns we had. We never felt we were being given the runaround or that our ideas and concerns were insignificant. For example they installed a 4"" vanity backsplash which didn't connect well to a 6"" wood trim piece. We pointed it out and they tore out the marble backsplash and redid it to 6"". 

Now, I'm not saying there weren't frustrations. Some language barriers and miscommunication between ourselves, management, and the crew reared its head from time to time, but whenever issues arose they were always fixed to our satisfaction and never impacted the end product. I don't believe you can have a multi-month long project without these issues arising, and I chalk them up as normal, and don't mark them down for this. 

One miscommunication example was that we asked them to put insulation in the shower plumbing wall which bordered the bedroom for noise reduction. They forgot to do this during the rough plumbing and said if we still wanted it done, they would open up the drywall in the bedroom side, then patch and paint the bedroom wall, which they did end up doing. This was a minor issue, and we would have been fine if they didn't want to do the work, but they went out of their way to make us happy.

Other minor issues stemmed from the crew not looking at the fixtures we purchased before finishing the rough plumbing in the first bathroom. Their expectation was that we would point out anything other than standard fixtures (we had a bar with handheld shower head; they assumed fixed shower head). Our expectation was that they would check with us before commencing rough plumbing (or at least take a look at the fixtures). The result ended up not being a big issue - a slightly less than ideal placement for the water outlet valve. However, we learned a valuable lesson and made sure to go over rough plumbing for the master bath with them beforehand.

In the end, both baths turned out beautiful, more so than I imagined. Overall, we had a very positive experience and highly recommend Horizon. 

A few tips: 
Get your fixtures early; unless you're ordering from a big box store, some items take a few weeks to get in. 

Make sure your expectations and visions are communicated. Enna writes up a detailed scope of work, make sure this is correct, though some items are difficult to envision when you initially go over the contract. 

Make sure to meet with Mark and show him your fixtures and expected placements before the crew starts rough plumbing. It will be much more difficult to change things once this has started."
5,"We had recently purchased a home and wanted to do some extensive remodeling before we moved in. That job included:
- Installing a new loft in a room that had a vaulted ceiling, and tying that new 2nd floor room into the existing stairs and hallway. This included new recessed lighting for both the new loft, and the now-shorter bottom floor room.
- Remodel the kitchen, including removal of an old fireplace to open up the kitchen and living room, new tile floors, reface and refinish all cabinets, replace all appliances, new backsplash
- Create a new bedroom from an existing open space, and re-frame the closet walls in the new room and in the adjoining master closet
- New wood floors in the 1st floor of the house, and new carpeting in the 2nd floor
- New interior paint throughout
- Refinish the front door
- Miscellaneous (installing new lights/fans/etc)

This project required securing a few city permits, which Horizon did without problem.

All in, I think this was about a 3.5mo project. We did not move in until it was completed.

We now love Angie's List because that's how we found Horizon, Mark, Enna, and Eli !

We've had both good contractor experiences, and otherwise. We had never used Horizon prior to this job. Our experience with Horizon has gone very well over these months. We wished we had a bigger budget to have them do more work for us, because they do great work at good value, but eventually we simply had to stop so we could move in.

Horizon is geared for client satisfaction on reasonably sized general contractor jobs. Here's a few excerpts of our experience:
- As we were settling on early design decisions, Mark was really helpful. Mark has a unique set of skills in design, engineering, contracting, etc. He brought great ideas forward that were good value decisions. For example, we were creating a new bedroom for our son which was on the small side. He recognized that, and came up with the idea to reconfigure the closet and master bdrm closet that was reasonable, got us a bigger room for our son, and made use of wasted space so that the master closet is still the same size or slightly larger.
- We had many conversations, as normal for such a project, about materials, finishes, and etc. Mark was really helpful at guiding those discussions to make good value decisions, based on what he heard from us. We've had contractors in the past who really know only one style or price-point and try to push it constantly, but we felt that Mark did a great job of listening to what we wanted and coming up with good creative ideas and compromises based on our objectives.
- Mark, Enna, and Eli were all consistent and reliable. If they said they would meet us at the house at a certain time, they were there on time and ready. We'd be lying if we said they were perfect, but they really made every effort to do their best.
- Our area has a substantial list of HOA requirements. We never once had a single complaint from a neighbor or HOA the entire time, despite a lot of work being done. They hauled off their own trash so our little trash bin wasn't overwhelmed, and generally kept the place picked up. Thanks, Eli !
- Shortly after we started w/Horizon, my husband noticed that somebody had backed into the mailbox and asked Mark if he thought one of his guys had done it. Mark just looked at it, and said ""Don't worry, I'll fix it."" A couple days later, a new mailbox is there that matched the old one, all fixed up. No debates, just happened.
- Near the end of the project, my husband made a comment about how the drain plumbing was routed. A couple days later, it was fixed. Again, no big debate or issue, just happened.
- After our front door was refinished, the exterior had a green tint to it that we had not expected. It wasn't terrible, and perhaps we were the only ones who would notice. Mark asked how we liked it, and could tell from our first reaction we didn't really like how it looked. But, it was not a terrible issue and we formally told Mark and Enna, in writing, that we'd accept it as-is and not to worry resanding/finishing it only for a modest cosmetic issue. It looked fine, and quality was good, but we just had an expectation of a more brownish deep wood finish. A week or so later, they refinished the door anyway, and now looks perfect.

There are more little stories like that, but you get the point. We thought that Horizon was highly focused on Customer Satisfaction in the way they ran the project from beginning to end. They took care to do good quality work, sought client feedback in a constructive way, and addressed issues quickly and practically. They had to get some city permits in this project which they got without a big problem, and they passed all the city inspections without issue.

One of the things which makes Horizon unique from others we considered was that there was no middle-man handoff from the Sales rep to the person who actually manages the job. We worked with Mark, Enna, and later Eli throughout the entire project. We really enjoyed getting to know them, and we thought the continuity of the relationship definitely contributed to the efficient outcome.

In our experience with Horizon, we found them to be professional, ethical, skilled, and hard-working throughout the process. We would recommend Horizon to our own family members.

Thank You, Horizon. You are a great team !"
5,"Horizon Construction immediately responded to our request for a quote. Mark came out to the house, listened to our ideas, and helped us to plan a remodel that exactly fit what we wanted. He also helped with picking out materials that fit our budget.
Work started on time (once all permits were approved), and moved quickly, without any work breaks.
There were no issues in contacting Horizon, and any issues that came up during the project were quickly addressed. 
We would highly recommend the Horizon team (Mark, Enna, and Sam) to any of our friends.
Looking forward to doing business with them again."
5,"Rescued from a nightmare!!!

We had a horrific experience with another contractor which left us with a bathroom that we couldn't use. The contractor lost their license and we were left with realizing we were going to have to start all over again.

Horizon came in a rescued us from our misery and delivered a beautiful new master bathroom! We were able to even get our guest bathroom a partial facelift too and we paid about the same for all of it! The work was done on time and their experts workers were very courteous and always left our house in great shape after a hard day's work.

We will recommend Horizon to all of our friends and family.

5,"Complete remodel of all the entire downstairs and common area of upstairs of 3,100 square foot home. Work included 1) kitchen (design, demolition of old kitchen, new cabinets, granite countertops, plumbing, electrical, relocation of gas cook top and vents, stone flooring, baseboards, and painting 2) family room (design, removal of wet bar, new cabinets, granite countertops, new fireplace, wood flooring, baseboards, and painting), 3) living room (wood flooring, electrical, baseboards, and painting), 4) powder room (design, new cabinets, granite countertops, plumbing, electrical, baseboards, and stone flooring), 5) laundry room (stone flooring, baseboards, and painting), 6) refinishing of wood staircase and upstairs cabinets, and 7) carpet upstairs.

As you can see, this was a major remodel project. I wanted a contractor to oversee all aspects, work with me on the design, stay on top of the job, do professional grade work, and show up every day, all at a fair price. I got that with Horizon. You can go with a cheaper contractor but I doubt you will get all of these qualities. Mark spent a lot of time with my wife and I selecting cabinets, granite countertops, and flooring making design suggestions. He also made recommendations as the job progressed. Enna was in contact with me daily and was a pleasure to deal with. The job started the day they said it would and ended on time. I checked the work done daily. If there was every an issue or I was not happy for some reason it was corrected without discussion. Horizon even did some upgrades to improve the look of the job and did not charge for it. They did not charge any large up front fees instead I paid as each aspect of the job was started and completed. Mark did a final inspection at the end sending some workers back to do minor touch ups. I would highly recommend Horizon."
5,We recently had new wood floors installed in the entire downstairs of our house.  The job included demolition of existing tile and carpet.  They hauled away the old tile and carpet and did a wonderful job installing my new floors.  Horizon also converted my old patio into a new patio/sunroof.  They added walls around the existing patio and installed windows and a sliding  glass door and doggy door.  I had a wonderful experience working with Horizon Construction and Remodeling.  Mark Besnos and Enna Eskin were very pleasant to talk to and they responded to every call I made to them.  Mark was on the job frequently to be sure things were being done to my satisfaction.  His crew was very hard working and did an excellent job - they were on the job daily and always cleaned up prior to leaving.  I was amazed at the progress that was made each day.  The entire job took approximately 4 weeks and stayed within my budget.  I am very pleased with the final product.  My floors are beautiful and I love my new patio/sunroom.  I would very highly recommend them to anyone that had a  job to be done.  I definitely plan to use them again in the future.
5,"Mark provided the second estimate on my kitchen remodel.  After making some recommendations and suggestions, we settled on a design, and Mark and Enna did their best to work within my budget while still providing quality materials and equipment.  

Enna held my hand through picking out my countertops and cabinets, and even guided me through the purchase of my appliances.   Mark came up with a great design based on my needs and what I had to work with.   Along the way there was some stress and misunderstandings, but both Mark and Enna worked tirelessly to make me happy and come up with great resolutions.    We were in contact every day either by phone or email, and Mark even rushed over on a Saturday when I needed my gas turned back on. 

I can't say enough about the finished product.  It is one of the most beautiful kitchens I've ever seen and it's mine.   Thanks Mark and Enna"
5,"Horizon Construction and Remodeling performed a complete remodel of two bathrooms, including expansion of exterior walls to increase size of bathrooms.
The completed work went beyond expectations. Top quality results. The workers were punctual, courteous and cleaned up after themselves. We enthusiastically recommend Horizon Construction and Remodeling for anyone seeking to remodel.
   We also recently added another job for this company, new railing and stairs. An awesome job again ."
5,"Horizon Constructions remodeled our guest bathroom, turning a tub into a walk-in frameless glass door shower, replacing the floor, the vanity and the toilet.  

Having had my kitchen remodeled with a different contractor, I was very impressed by the punctuality of Horizon Construction, Enna always kept me updated and in the loop of what to expect and when!  Also updated us promptly on any issues or problems.

Mark had a very keen eye for design and gave us suggestions on the materials for both the floors and the shower and also few other design elements.

Also, they replaced the glass door when Mark noticed a crack that both me and my husband missed!  We really liked the professionalism and the meticulousness that Mark and Enna showed.

It has been two months since the job was completed, but I encountered a recent problem with the shower door and contacted Enna about it.  She assured us when the job was finished that the bathroom was under warranty as well.  She is working on getting the issue addressed.  I love the follow up and the fact that they stand behind their work.

I would definitely recommend this company."
4,"We had a bathroom from 1964 completly remodeled. The original bathroom was about 10 ft. by 4-1/2 ft. with a tub/ shower and dividing wall. We had the tub removed and one wall torn out and rebuilt to expand the room by 2-1/2 ft. We had the original window removed and replaced it with a custom size window which was built into the shower walll. This required structural wall modifications and outside stucco work. We moved all of the plumbing to allow for a large tile shower to be built. This required cutting the slab foundation and installing new drain plumbing for the shower, toilet and sink. New vent pipes were required and had to be installed in the new wall and thru the roof. The shower required extensive plumbing to allow for a cieling rain can, body sprays and a hand held head. We added a fan/ light which required venting thru the roof. The shower was tiled from floor to cieling and the remainder of the room was also tiled about 40"" up from the floor. A frameless 3/8"" glass door was also installed. Two recessed lights were installed in the shower cieling along with vanity lighting."
5,"Horizon remodeled 3 average-sized bathrooms, and re-tiled a fireplace. The job included: Hot-mopping and floating cement on showers, installing tile on floors, shower, bath surround, and fireplace, installing bathtub, custom shower door and vanities, quartz countertops, sinks, toilets, faucets, fans and lighting, painting, installing baseboards, and bath accessories. 

When I first met with Mark Besnos, it was clear that he had an eye for detail. Mark had some great design ideas, and helped me pick out tile, cabinets. Everything was done very professionally; Mark drew up a detailed contract, and all changes were made with addendums. Mark also provided all of the relevant licenses and insurance documents without having to ask. In the end Mark made sure every last detail was perfect. 

Enna Eskin did an amazing job managing the project. She was always super friendly, knowledgeable, and professional, and was great about using email and text to keep in touch while I was at work. Enna kept me informed of what was happening throughout, and also let me know ahead of time when there were things that I needed to do. 

The work crews were friendly, and considerate. They worked very hard, and performed high-quality work. They did a good job of protecting my floors and furniture, and keeping the mess to a minimum. 

I love my new bathrooms and fireplace. Everything turned out beautifully, and was done on time and within budget."
4,"Early in 2012 we took three contractors' bids for a master bath remodel for our home. In addition to a price we could afford, Horizon Construction gave us some good design ideas and a feeling that they would take good care of us. They weren't the cheapest bid, but we wanted to work with someone who got all the costs out there up front, without adding on later. We felt that's how they made their bid, so we selected them for our job. 

The project would remove the small glass shower enclosure and basically unused bathtub that were there from the original home construction, and also upgrade the vanity with a nicer piece and put a granite top on it. The old toilet would be replaced. The linoleum floor would be replaced with tile which would match nicely the tile of the new shower enclosure. Since we don't use the bathtub, we opted to have more open space beside a larger shower enclosure, and no bathtub. Horizon would also install the toilet, sinks and plumbing fixtures that we furnished for the job; mount new mirrors over the vanity, install new lighting, and paint the walls.

My wife and I didn't have firm ideas on the decor, so the consultation from Horizon was very helpful. We did a session at the building materials showroom together. Once we settled on the color scheme and materials, and the fixtures that we needed to furnish to them for installation, the demolition work began and was finished very quickly and cleanly. Horizon did almost all of the work during the daytime when my wife and I were both at work. They took good care of our house and securely locked it up at the end of their day when they left.

The floor and shower tile work was perfect, and the custom glass (nothing fancy, just clear but it's just what we wanted) was installed on time, and still looks great. Part-way along Horizon suggested we consider a unique tile backsplash around the vanity, using the same accent tiles that are in the floor and the shower. They gave us a special price and although we hadn't wanted to add to our budget, we took their offer. It's a really pretty blue aqua glass tile that is the key element to the whole decoration scheme. The look we got is a bit unique, and breaks from the cookie-cutter conservative approach of the original homebuilder. Very nice and more than worth the money. If we ever sell the home, we'll point out the very custom look of the vanity.

Horizon got the building inspections and everything got approved straight off. Once the painting was done there were just a few finishing touches to get, but Horizon finished ahead of the project schedule, which is nice if your master bathroom opens onto your master bedroom and you're actually trying to live there, as we were! My son was so glad that we didn't have to share his bathroom any longer. But the bottleneck was worth it when work was complete.

Incidentally, for the new toilet, which we picked up at Costco (remember, tight budget), we bought the AMDM IntelliSeat, an electronic toilet seat (if you don't know what it is, just Google it...once you have it, you can't go back) to replace the standard seat. Although Horizon didn't seem to have experience with that product, they installed it perfectly and we love it.

About six months after the project was completed and we'd paid our final check to Horizon, the motion-sensing light switch they'd installed in the bathroom began malfunctioning. It got to be too annoying so I gave Horizon a call to see if they'd fix it for us. They reminded me that they made a full warranty on all their work, and scheduled someone to come out and work on the switch. Their man came to our house and replaced the faulty switch with a new one, which now works perfectly.

We love our bathroom and are so satisfied with Horizon's work. They are friendly professionals who follow up, deal with issues and problems when they occur, finish ahead of schedule, and back up their work."
5,"This project included total demo and reconstruction of 3 bathrooms. It included converting the master bath from a Roman tub to a walk-in shower with travertine to the top of all walls which had cathedral ceilings and a triangular window. and replacing toilets, vanities, sinks, and all fixtures. In the guest bath, the tub was replaced with a new tub and travertine on the walls. The sink, vanity and toilet were also replaced, adding an enclosure using 3/8 inch sliding doors. In the downstairs shower, old ceramic tile was removed and replaced with travertine. The toilet, vanity, and sink were also replaced. The floors in all bathrooms were removed and replaced with travertine.
 
In late September 2012, after getting an estimate from another company for our planned remodel of 2 bathrooms, a large master bath and a smaller downstairs bath, we made an appointment with Horizon Construction and Remodeling for an estimate. We had previously read reviews here on Angie’s List.
Mark arrived at the designated time, discussed with us our plans, then took measurements of the bathrooms. He also made suggestions regarding the project. He suggested that we meet with him at MSI to look at a variety of materials so he could more accurately provide an estimate.
After deciding to have Horizon do the project, we made an appointment with Mark to go over the contract, scope of work, and the payment schedule. It was determined that work could begin on October 3 but since demolition could only begin midday, We decided that early morning the following day would be best.
The demolition crew arrived as scheduled and the project was started. Demolition of the 2 bathrooms was completed in 2 days and work began on the remodel construction. Each segment of the project went smoothly. In the meantime, we went with Mark to select a marble slab for the countertops. We also met with the cabinet maker regarding the custom vanities and color of the stain.
Work progressed smoothly and ahead of schedule. Along the way, we made several changes. Enna was very helpful in accomplishing those changes and doing the paperwork involved. She is an invaluable asset to the company.
When the original project was well on its way to completion, we decided to go ahead and do the third bathroom since we had enough marble left from the slab to do the countertop. Also, the vanity in the upstairs guest bath was the same size as the downstairs bath which made the custom construction easier and more efficient.
Mark was here on a regular basis to check on progress, answer questions, and listen to our concerns. In some cases, he had noticed things that needed correction before we even brought them up.
Any remodel project, and especially one of this magnitude, is stressful. I know of several cases where projects lasted much longer than anticipated but that was not the case here. The projected completion date was January 10, 2013, however, work was completed December 15, 2012, which made our Holiday Season more enjoyable than it might have otherwise been! The master bath, which was converted from a Roman tub to a walk-in shower is amazing and the other two bathrooms are elegant as well.
Horizon Construction and Remodeling is dependable and you can expect them to do what they agreed to do. The quality of their work is good and everyone we encountered was responsible for their part of the job. My only admonition to you is that you make sure the scope of work that you sign off on includes all the things you discussed and thought would be there.
If you have a project in mind, call Horizon Remodeling and Construction and give them an opportunity to discuss it with you before you make a final decision. We are pleased with how our bathrooms came out and would not hesitate to call Horizon for another project"
5,"Completely restructured our fireplace, hard wood floor, added new railing, and installed surround sound

They are incredible, I would give them the highest rating possible without a shadow of a doubt. They are professional and do great work every time we have had them out. Their communication is great and they are all perfectionists. I would recommend them to anyone in the future. I have never had a better experience. Mark has great vision for remodeling and always holds his work to a higher standard
Horizon Construction was outstanding to work with from beginning to end. Mark Besnos is a visionary who does exceptional work. Mark and Enna (owners) were in constant communication with continual supervision to ensure quality results.They transformed a tired 1970's condo into a beautiful living environment. We will use this professional contractor again in our future remodel."
5,It was a pleasure working with Mark and Enna and all of their crew members. Mark and Enna went out of their way to find just the right fixtures and French doors that  I envisioned for my new master bedroom. I am especially happy with the double doors that were hung on my new closet. I was very pleased with how much attention was given to the finest details and how quickly they were able to complete the construction.
5,"We enjoyed working with Mark and Enna to remodel and update our master bathroom. Mark was especially helpful during the planning phase when he listened patiently to our endless questions and provided useful information and suggestions that helped us reach decisions about project materials and stylistic choices. After work began, Mark and Enna continued to be very responsive to us regarding scheduling aspects of the work and finalizing decisions about the details. Throughout the process, they stressed that the goal was to create a master bathroom that we would really enjoy, even if that meant occasionally changing our minds about details or adding new work at times. This was our first major renovation project, and we feel that Mark, Enna and their team did a great job guiding us through it and creating a great new room to enhance our home."
5,"Our kitchen & Den was recently remodeled and everyone we dealt with @ SOD Home Group was nice, professional, and performed quality work. 
The entire staff was committed to ensuring that the experience met our expectations. Whenever we had a question or concern on anything they addressed it immediately. We would highly recommend SOD Home Group for your renovations."
5,"From start to finish, SOD Home Group was phenomenal to work with, and they went above and beyond in designing and building the addition of our dreams. Everyone we worked with (our designers, our carpenter, production supervisor, office staff) were all so friendly, competent and professional. It was as painless an experience as possible, given that we remodeled our whole house while living in it.
They really pulled that off !"
5,"They did an excellent job! We are very satisfied with the price, quality, and professional installation. They remodeled the kitchen in a timeframe that they promised. I’m looking forward to starting the bathroom remodeling project in a few months. Everything in our kitchen matches the theme we were going for.
I would recommend them to anyone needing to update their kitchen!"
5,"We recently decided to sell our home and needed some work done quickly ( kitchen, bathroom and master bedroom). I contacted SOD Home Group and as expected, they made it happen. We had the teams out within a week. And, most importantly, the work was still at the same high caliber as it always is. They finished everything in 3 weeks. I will certainly use them again as I know they do quality job. We love our home so much that we feel bad to sell it now."
5,"I am thoroughly pleased with SOD HOME GROP From design creation to the project manager I can not praise them enough for their professionalism and attention to detail. Once we agreed on the initial aspects of the job, work began. Our project manager was open to our ideas, provided many thoughts of his own, and made time on multiple occasions to go over selection of materials and to review the design. 
I tell EVERYONE I know how consistently fantastic this company is. Our room addition looks better than we ever imagined it could be!"
5,"We were looking for a  local reputable remodeling company to renovate our entire home. Thankfully, we came across SOD HOME GROUP Company, who proven to be an expert in home remodeling and interior designing. They did a fantastic job and gave our home a stylish and sophisticated look. We had a great experience with this company. Highly recommended! Charles Martin"
5,"They just finished to renovate our guest house and backyard  for us and it turned out great. Extremely professional. From the very beginning, he provided a line by line estimate so that there was never any confusion about what needed to be done. We never had to worry that he was going come back to us and ask for more money. Communication was excellent. I felt confident that I could reach them by phone or text at any time. When unexpected issues arose, they were quick to do everything they could to see that it was taken care of in a timely manner. Would absolutely recommend and will use again in the future."
5,"This company is amazing. Their Crews showed up on time fully equipped and did an amazing job restoring everything. After the demolition and the removal of the our guest house they set the equipment up in a very clean and workable set up. They are very knowledgeable and very educational. They took the time to educate my wife and myself about every step and how every step was going to happen and the goals that had to be met before each step could move on. When they left the house each day it look they had never even been here. They were so meticulous with their clean up, it was amazing. I would recommend them highly to everybody!"
5,"Active participation, attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of both quality and timely project execution are just some of the attributes this team exemplifies! I have had the privilege of being awarded several projects over the years and have thoroughly enjoyed working with SOD Home Group Team! I look forward to even more successful projects with these professionals and your home could be their next masterpiece! Thanks a lot!"
5,"The renovations of our three bathrooms, kitchen and Guest House went great and the transformations were amazing! I HIGHLY recommend Christian ! He is timely, fair priced, easy to work with, meticulous and does great work. Nowadays , it's hard to trust someone in your house. I have to say he earned our trust even enough that we left him with a key to our house while we went on a vacation and came home to our beautiful home! We are very pleased!"
5,"Oren and his team were amazing and I could not give them a higher recommendation!! We had an attic project that involved a bathroom and bedroom, and creating a new room in an old, very tight space. Oren provided us a response via email, saw the space and provided an estimate within 2 days, then started the project and completed it within another 3-4 weeks! His work is beautiful, his estimate was right in the middle and far less than we were expecting (and he stayed right on budget!) and his team was extremely professional, timely and responsive to our questions. Could not say more good things about SOD HOME GROUP. This is exactly what we wanted!!"
5,Oren is very professional and quick to get a hold with when you need things done. I work with him to fix some issue with my condo when i was putting it on the market. And still working with him on the house I am about to buy with the inspection issues. He gives very reasonable prices to fix the problem.
5,"Our Garage conversion designer, was amazing. The only agenda was that we create spaces that fit us and our lifestyle, and that we be thrilled with the outcome. They never pushed us and always listened to us and responded to what we wanted. Honestly, he is the consummate designer and professional. SOD HOME GROUP gets a standing ovation."
5,"Don't look anywhere else. To say that my job didn't go exactly according to plan would be an understatement and Mario and his entire team were pros from start to finish. Our job was a demo of our old guest house and rebuilding, designing and installing a beautiful new guest house under the watchful eye of Mario and the team. The consistent communication from Mario was also a huge plus as the home is a complete remodel and I'm rarely on site. Finally, remember that you get what you pay for; there may be cheaper contractors out there, but there aren't any better - take that to heart."
5,"I can't thank SOD Home group enough. They were organized from the onset. Their presentation was better than anyone else that my family and I looked requested bids from. They were great through every step of the process. From demolition, to installing/building everything, to having it all completed. I enjoyed the process of it all. Awesome."
5,"Oren from SOD Home Group , led our house renovation project over a period of five weeks.  Oren and his team were responsive, professional and accommodating of our requirements - from the initial estimate meeting up to the finish of the project. We even added items to the original scope, along the way, and they were still able to complete on time and on budget.  
As the project came to an end, we had to do a detailed quality check ourselves, but once we pointed out any outstanding finishes, they finished the job to perfection. We would definitely work with Oren and team again for any future renovation needs."
5,"This started out as a project to make my mother in laws home ADA compliant, and we ended up updating the entire home. It seemed logical after discussions with Mario, and so we moved forward. The project was completed very quickly due to our timeline and the results are phenomenal! Working with contractor Mario was a pleasure. He is honest and hard-working and is a complete contrast to my previous experiences. Will use them for all my future projects."
5,"After interviewing several companies for the room addition project, we hired SOD Home Group. We were very impressed with the vision, professionalism, and ideas from our sales representative Mario . We valued all the detailed and self-explanatory estimates and budget, including the schedule that was presented to us before we signed the contract. When the remodeling project started, we were updated daily via e-mails and additional visits by Mario. The people who worked at the house on the project were respectful of our house and they always cleaned at the end of each day. They also guided us with all the interior design with the selection of light fixtures, floor tiles, and paint color/style choices. At the end of the remodeling project, it addressed any detail that we needed additional attention on.
Our room addition turned out to be a success and it’s our favorite room in my home :)"
5,"Oren is fantastic! His team seriously saved my butt. I hired them, to remodel my kitchen and 3 bathrooms, and am so very glad that I did. They worked very hard to deliver on a timeline that was, I'm sure, terrible- but they really came through for me. He's gone out of his way to make a difficult situation less stressful. Oren is extremely professional and I would highly recommend him. He's clearly very knowledgeable, and has been very communicative. Seriously can't thank him enough for bailing me out of this mess"
5,We had needed to replace our bathroom. We set up a meeting with SOD Home Group team. Oren was extremely professional. He explained the process and our choices and was very pleasant and professional. The project was handled very professionally - the workers were punctual and cleaned up after themselves daily. The project was completed on time for exactly what Oren had quoted in the estimate. He was easy to get in touch with if we had questions. The Bathroom looks amazing. This company stands by its warranty and its word. We were thrilled with the service we received them and would highly recommend this company.
5,"Today, I met the designer who’ll be my right hand planning our kitchen and 2 bathrooms renovation. The designer was very informative and guided me in choosing my desired design and suggested us to think about how we’ll be preparing meals, and consider schedule before setting a date for work to begin. I am very excited for the results! Absolutely excellent customer service!"
5,"What a fresh breath of air speaking to Mario. His honesty and non sales approach to helping me understand the process
After thinking about an ADU for such a long time we finally started looking into it the last 5 months. We spoke to a lot of contractors and really felt comfortable with the knowledge and value this company had. We could not be happier with the result highly recommend!!!"
5,We had a major large bath remodel....Every pat of the job from the virtual design to punch out was handled without any issues.  I was most impressed  how they did not nickel and dime me for minor changes. .  Special thanks to Mario who obviously have renovated hundreds of baths
5,"Full bath basement project finished on budget. The crew was Very punctual, good quality work and cleaned up every evening when finished. Project turned out good and I would recommend"
5,"Absolutely the best ADU contractor ( well
At least we think they are ) . They did a spectacular job creating a 900 sqft 2bed, 1.5bath dwelling unit on my house earlier in 2021. From designing the floorplans to handling the paperwork and picking the right materials to the actual construction, I was beyond pleased with their knowledge and expertise at each step. The finished product superseded our expectations. I feel fully confident in giving a high recommendation for this company for your ADU project. You Rock !!"
5,SOD Home Group went above and beyond and delivered better than what I could have imagined. They stand by their work and I will be working with them on my future projects. Thank you for getting our room addition done in time for the holidays.
5,"SOD Home Group  is definitely one of the premier renovation contractors in CA. These guys aren't your typical contractors who show up in an old truck, 2 hours late, and do the job half-ass. They're pros. Seriously. Down to their branding, customer service and quality of work. You get what you pay for and SHG is well worth your money if you want the job done right."
5,"We were quite pleased with SOD Home Group - from the initial consultation, changes made based on budget and preference, help with picking colors, patterns and materials. Everyone involved was pleasant and patient with us. 
The finished work looks great, and the few items that have required 'tweaks' post project have been handled quickly and cheerfully.
Will use them again, I'm sure!"
5,"It was a pleasure working with Oren and his crew, we would definitely call them again. They were in touch with us almost everyday letting us know what was going on and if we had any questions. All of the crews that came were professional, flexible and thorough, any issues were promptly taken care of without fuss. We ended up spending more than we had anticipated mainly because of Oren’s enthusiasm and the designs they prepared for us were outstanding, it was hard to say no. The finished work is beautiful, we are very happy!"
5,"as a woman, I appreciate how respectful Oren was when providing me with an estimate, going over the contract, and discussing the end results. Although I knew nothing about room addition, he did not make me feel dumb regardless of how many questions I had or explanations I required. He was thorough and transparent. He complied with my requests and made sure I was 100% comfortable with moving forward. I was impressed how quick and efficiently the team worked. After 10 bids and lots of reference checking, they were among the best in pricing, customer service, and job completion."
5,"SOD Home Group completed a major remodel and home addition project for us.  We interviewed a few other contractors, but SOD stood out because of their fair pricing, confidence and professionalism.  We interviewed two other home owners who had used SOD in the past and they had great things to say about Oren and his group.  They transformed our ageing 1600 sq.ft. home into an amazing 2900 sq. ft. that is absolutely breathtaking.  Since this was our dream home being built, we were very involved in selecting materials for the project and the SOD team was very accommodating. They also worked well with other contractors like HVAC, fire sprinkler and sidewalk.   They executed the job to perfection while coordinating with the city for inspections. They did a great job with everything from the laying of the new foundation, framing, electrical, plumbing.  The best part was that they did an excellent job of finishing including flooring, painting, etc.  They were very responsive to fixing minor touch-ups even after we had moved in.  I would whole heartedly recommend SOD."
5,SOD Home Group folks worked on our bedroom remodel. The work was done on time and the quality was great.
5,"I wanted to do a tech update and remodel to my home in Saratoga. The home was outdated for my style. The SOD Home Group team could handle everything. I had a designer that I wanted to use, but they didn’t pan out and SOD Home Group hooked me up with another designer who did an amazing job. They worked together well, so my experience was very easy. Oren kept me up to date as far as they progress. His experience as a General Contractor made me feel at ease. He really knows what he’s doing. We opened the space up and did a lot of updates, including the pool, which needed to be updated and repaired. The result is exactly what I wanted, and I didn’t have to stay out of my home longer than estimated which I was nervous about. Everything turned out great! Worth every penny!"
5,"We were considering remodeling our entire house for several years now and we just never had the money to. When we could finally afford it, we were so spooked about hiring a contractor. Every story we heard was so terrifying! Everyone we knew remodeled got ripped off, the contractor did a horrible job and had to redo the project, or simply took their money and never showed up. We went on a couple of different routes to deeply search and find the right contractor for our project. After meeting a couple of them, we signed a contract with SOD Home Group. They had great appearance online and when we asked if they can take us to a few of their completed and ongoing projects, Oren did not hesitate! Oren immediately agreed. We remodeled our kitchen, bathrooms, living room, dining room, backyard, front yard, and added a new laundry room. Oren’s crew was so respectful, clean, and always on time. Living in your home through construction can be a little bothersome and disturbing. Not to mention that you have no privacy but SOD Home Group crew gave us as much privacy as possible and also disturbed me as little as possible since we work from home (since this COVID started). The quality and craftsmanship they provided is just superb! If you are looking for an honest, and trustworthy contractor definitely call SOD home Group! Oren and the team made what we thought would be a horrible experience into a marvelous, easy-going! we’ll certainly be contacting them down the road for all my remodeling projects."
5,"I took 5 estimates for our remodeling project that included the garage, kitchen, 2 bathrooms. SOD Home Group was by far the fairest bid and the most knowledgeable contractor. Oren was my project manager. Unlike one of the other contractors who completely disregarded my ideas, Oren listened to my ideas and helped me realize them. The project ran into some delays as Oren worked to clear through permitting challenges. Thank goodness that Oren was so diligent in resolving those challenges. Oren and I were in constant contact from the beginning of the year until mid-July, when the job was completed (and I mean constant communication, daily). The consistent communication was also very appreciated. At the end of the day, I felt I could trust Oren, and that is a truly rare thing. If you need help with any remodeling project, give these guys a call — they are good."
5,"The best way I can explain my experience with this company is that everything was done marvelously. One thing Oren promised us from day one is that we will get custom work. That’s exactly what we received - custom remodeling in all matters of the project. Oren helped us hire a custom cabinet maker. They did custom kitchen cabinets, linen closets and our bathroom vanities. Next we needed custom doors and windows since our house was so old and we had to fit all sizes, so once again Oren helped us hire a custom door and window maker. Since we have a large space and the flooring runs through pretty much both top and bottom level and we didn’t want to rip out the old woods, we had to hire someone to make us new custom flooring to match the old one that they had put in close to 90 years ago. We also ended up redoing all of our electric lines, plumbing lines, drain lines and gas lines. Oren helped us hire a plaster specialist who could duplicate the plaster texture that they had done many years ago. He also could help us find the company to duplicate the old plaster base and ceiling molding. Because this was such an old house and large house, we had to get the right contractor to do custom remodeling work. Oren could find us all the local specialists who work in older homes and can duplicate the quality and craftsmanship of what they had used earlier on. We had a lot of woodwork which needed to be customized, not just installation, but also custom making the actual moldings from scratch. One of the best things about Oren was that he had the answers to a lot of our questions. But what I like most about him is that he didn’t get scared of a challenge and in fact pursuited head-on. If there was something that he didn’t know, he wouldn’t just say, well that’s not my problem. He would help us find the right person or company to do that. I’m truly grateful that we could find Oren and his company to help us renovate this property. The house looks marvelous but the best thing about it is that you can’t tell that it was done now it still looks like it was built 100 years ago. What Oren could do for us was that he gave us great ideas to keep the old charm of the house but still update the house where we have a smart home and smart thermostat and the ability to control a lot of different aspects from our phones or tablets. I truly believe that we spent a premium on this renovation. But it was definitely worth it because the house looks marvelous and the property values since we have done the renovation have gone through the roof. Oren was definitely the most expensive contractor that we had interviewed but he was also the most understanding and the most caring. Also another great thing about him was that he was always accessible to us. Whether we called him, texted him or emailed him he would always get back to us immediately. I have heard of horror stories from other clients and contractors. I’m glad that this was not our experience."
5,"I’ve been through my share of remodels and almost all the experiences took more time, more money...you know the story. And then my mother’s condo had water damage, which was uninhabitable. Despite solid insurance, the moment the tests came back positive for mold and sewage, we knew this was going to be a complete move out, demo and remodel. I had 5 bids come back and chose Oren with SOD Hoe Group. He and his team are my heroes. Open communication, direct eye contact, honest opinions, quick problem solving, and most of all, they took care of us when COVID hit and the building shut down to all contractors. Even though we had weeks left on our schedule to get the job done, I could have the Board give us 5 days so that my mother could move back in and they made it happen with no changes to the original renderings. Oren’s communication was impeccable, with immediate responses to every question and request. The craftsmanship is PERFECTION! Thank you, Oren!!!"
5,"We started our complete remodeling project by remodeling the kitchen and bathrooms and because it went much better than we expected… we remodeled all the other sections of the house (front and back yard, pool, garage and more…). Oren helped us to select all the finishing materials and fixtures that we needed for the entire remodeling, and his workers worked every day and they completed the project on time. Our huge remodeling project went so well that the house got a fresh look and feel. Oren and the rest of the team did a very professional job and we are very pleased with the results. We recommend them to anyone considering a remodeling project."
5,"Oren and his team at SOD Home Group were beyond excellent regarding my home remodeling project. They were thorough, detailed and kept me informed regarding most of the important parts of the remodeling the entire time. I am mainly pleased with the fresh look and open space of our house which got a fresh look and wide open space. It didn’t matter to us, but there was a bit of a disconnect between the sales pitch timeline and the actual timeline for the demo and installation. I wanted quality, and that’s what I got."
5,"SOD Home Group made our long time vision come true. Overall, we knew what we wanted when we decided to re-landscape our front and back yard, but going from head to paper to reality doesn’t always happen mainly because we wanted too much that at the end would not look good. Lucky for us, Oren, with his exceptional experience and knowledge, could make it happen. Oren’s knowledge as an arborist made it easy for us to communicate our ideas while taking advantage of his design expertise. He was creative in working with our budget, his expert crew was hardworking, conscientious, and respectful of Covid protocol, and Oren continues to follow up to make sure our garden is thriving. We could not be happier with our new front yard, and are looking forward to having SOD Home Group back for future projects."
5,"We have been dreaming for a few years about how we will design the kitchen, what will it have and how it will serve us. We wanted it to be and look no less than perfect. We worked closely with Mr. Oren on the initial design (which after a few corrections and meetings, become the final one) and he gave us many beautiful ideas and solutions to select from and to have as part of the remodeling. At the end, we are happy, very much with his design, work, time frame to finish the remodeling job and his super happy personality. Oren is a pleasure person to work with. He always made sure that our vision of what we want… will matches what he can do and now we are in love with the new kitchen. Very high skilled company and we recommend to anyone that in case they want any beautiful remodeling job with a truly honest company and excellent customer support... they will have to contact this company."
5,"I highly recommend Oren, SOD Home Group! He is very knowledgeable, answered all my questions (and more), very professional, and responsive. He spent over 3 hours showing me all the possibilities that can be done to my kitchen, if you know little about all the little details about remodeling your home (like I do), he will explain it to you in terms that you will completely understand and turns your ideas into this beautiful 3D design. Oren also had great ideas and recommendations on how to attain your dream home. He knows house histories, and why houses were built in a certain way! He is unlike any other contractor that will just throw out random price of how much the renovation could cost you without showing you hard proof. I’m a visual learner, so when Oren made this amazing 3D design using the exact measurement of my kitchen, it blew my mind. It even gave me a chance to actually change few things that did not quite look right with kitchen. Most importantly, he will make sure you will enjoy and have fun designing your home. Oren, you are the best!"
5,"We are really proud and happy to give this rating and review to SOD Home Group based on our excellent experience with Oren, the team of people who worked at our house, and the company. We really value his professionalism. Oren proved us to be very honest, quick understanding person and mainly good listener (based on the fact that he made it happen with our budget). Oren heard our concerns and goals and was very realistic about what to expect for taking on an addition project. Oren also provided us with several additional ideas that we didn’t know we can implement them at all. We decided to hire Oren and his team immediately after we went over his estimate and 3D drawings of the remodeling project. Now that they finished our addition remodeling project (6 months after), we can write clearly that we highly recommend Oren for any major projects for your home."
5,"We hired SOD Home Group to handle a large remodel of my home. Oren and his crew removed a large load-bearing wall and reworked my old living room and kitchen into an open concept floor plan. He also had some great ideas to cleanly route our TV/media equipment into the new coat closet that he built for us. Ultimately, all of our concerns and requests were addressed. My husband and I panicked when our new hardwood floors were incredibly squeaky, and he had his subcontractors come back to fix the problem. When our new kitchen cabinets from Home Depot arrived crooked, his company expertly solved the issue. On top of that, Oren was able to complete our project several weeks earlier than we were hoping. We are expecting to hire Oren again when we will be ready to execute our next home renovation project."
5,"We had creative SOD home Group redo all of our home and due to the COVID-19, it took longer then we thought it would but the final remodeling work is stunning. My husband was very specific about what he wanted and Oren with his professional teams were able to deliver it beyond our expectations. Working with Oren was very easy, straightforward and they were always professional. What made this remodeling safe and well was that Oren made sure that each day the teams will clean as much as they could and that they will wear masks and gloves while working. We don’t think that we will ever going to use any other contractor after having such a significant experience with them. They are definitely our go to."
5,"Oren and his crew just finished the complete remodeling of our new home. The work took several months and during this time they remodeled each space including the kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, entry etc… Oren started with the 3D design and after we agreed on that phase, he came up with execution plan including the prices. The work was managed by him daily and according to the schedule that he planned for us. They informed us on every step of the work while Oren made sure that the price will remain within the agreed budget. We really love the new remodeling and our home got a brand fresh look. We highly recommend Oren and each one of his crew for any remodeling project."
5,"SOD Home Group is the BEST home improvement company by far!! We worked with Oren and his crews of people and right from the beginning of the work, Oren was very professional, honest, hardworking man and good communicator. He always was on time and he made sure that the people will deliver the best results in the work. Our project (which was a complete kitchen remodeling) was completed on time and within the agreed budget. We will use SOD Home Group for all of our future projects."
5,"SOD Home Group did a major renovation in our home, removing two load-bearing walls holding the second floor, remodeling our kitchen, the downstairs bathroom, family room and the roof, a complete remodel. Their price was the second highest out of the five estimates we got, but I was looking for a contractor to provide a high quality and hassle free remodel. I really appreciated the communication via the WhatsApp Oren installed on my phone, which made our communication throughout the design stage and the actual project very easy. There were a few minor hiccups with the color of the grout and some other final finishing, but Oren took care of them to our satisfaction. SOD Home Group is definitely for those who want a thorough professional contractor that provides a high-quality hassle free remodel."
5,"We contracted with SOD Home Group to totally update and remodel a large part of our house that basically included the hallway, complete Kitchen, guest bathroom and 2 additional bathrooms and bedrooms. Oren was honest about the work and gave us a very realistic estimate and a time frame of the completion date for the entire work at our house. This was an excellent plus because all the other contractors that we brought in to our house were just trying to get the remodeling job signed and would probably up charge us later. Oren was very communicative from the first day and a very easy person to reach if we had any question or concern about the work progress or even if we were interesting in a minor change. The teams of workers were respectful and efficient, mainly since we had to complete the job during this COVID-19 timing and to move in with the family during the process. While there were some issues that raised during the work, Oren could get the remodeling job completed and we’re thrilled with our new home. This was really our first and largest remodeling project, so we felt it went as smoothly as possible. Our only issue was the tiles we ended up choosing for the floor and shower were not the best quality. We wish that had been flagged to us sooner since we spent a small fortune on the remodel, but the bathroom looks beautiful and we’d highly recommend shopping around for tile."
5,"We went over many estimates for our complete ADU project we needed to do since we work from home because of COVID. The Addition included: kitchen and a small bathroom. We hesitate on who should we hire for this, as we know stories when the remodeling projects not finished or done correctly. All the contractors we met were too pushy to make us sign, and we didn’t want to move forward with anyone because of that. We met Oren from SOD Home Group. he was very friendly, professional and accessible throughout the entire project. He really did a fabulous work from the design to the demolition and finally the installation. His team came every day; and they completed the work on the promised time. Oren has done the best remodeling in my house, hands-down! And we will definitely contact him soon to also renovate our other house! Trust, friendliness, and professionalism are absolutely what you will get when choosing this company."
5,"SOD Home Group was strongly recommended to me by a co-worker who stated that the company was exceptionally reliable and did a quality job. At first, I thought their price was a bit high but because of the recommendation; I chose to hire them to remodel my entire house. They were great from start to finish. I was worried about bringing a team into the house during COVID, but they were great. They wore masks; they were super respectful and treated my house as a living space and not as a construction zone. The crew was extremely courteous and kind. One of the major reasons I chose to hire SOD Home Group was because I was assured by Oren, the company owner, that he will manage my project directly and that he would be involved in all stages of the project. Oren stood by his word and made sure to always keep me updated throughout all the stages of my project. He made sure I was always aware of the upcoming schedule and verified that I always had all the required materials to keep the project running smoothly and seamlessly. The quality of work came out as expected, stunning! The Kitchen and bathrooms were completely transformed and I feel like I am living in a brand new home. I am so impressed with Oren and SOD Home Group. This project came out better than I could have ever imagined, and I couldn’t be happier."
5,"Oren and the guys at SOD Home Group did a stellar job on our big home remodeling project. We added a second story to our Los Angeles home, nearly doubling it in size. We also moved a kitchen and living room wall and completely gutted our kitchen. We basically rebuilt the entire home, while doing our best to change the character of our home.We had tried to start this process several years back, running into snags and unethical contractors along the way, and are so happy that we landed in the capable hands of this team. At every step along the way, we felt honestly communicated with and cared for on a personal level. Besides this, all the subcontractors they worked with were top-notch and considerate of our neighbors. Not only did they do a remarkable job and make our house the talk of the neighborhood, they went above and beyond to really be sure we were always 100% happy with all the work being done. Even with the pandemic hitting right in the middle of our project, they finished within our original timeline as promised. I would without a doubt recommend them for any project you have, large or small. I’m attaching a few photos to show the scale of our undertaking. Enjoy!"
5,"I hired Oren and SOD to do a major construction and remodel project back in 2015. We received a number of bids and went with SOD b/c they were most competitive, organized, and responsive. Oren took the time to understand our project and vision for the remodel. He said ""once you're a customer, you're always a customer"" and stayed true to that statement. The project progressed according to schedule, which is rare for a project of this size. My 3rd party architect made some mistakes (not SOD's fault) that resulted in change orders, permit delays, and additional expenses -- which Oren ultimately waived in good faith. The project ultimately finished on time and according to budget. We're now 5+ years later and Oren is still committed to ""make it right"" without question as issues arise."
5,"We hired Oren, the contractor for ADU Garage Conversion. We went with him and his team on such a large remodeling project because he is ‘the’ specialist in that area. They also gave me very competitive price. Oren and his team were a real pleasure to work with. Oren and the team that worked at our house were always on time, respectful, disciplined and responsible. The project was finished ahead of the promised schedule and outcome is great. Big thanks to Oren. very honest and helpful person. Highly recommend SOD Home Group!"
5,"SOD Home Group is a company that lets you sleep at night.  They take on your project like they are doing it for themselves.  From the person answering the phone to Oren crunching the numbers to Eden who managed my project and visited our home daily and made sure that the workers are given the right attention to all the details. SOD Home Group become like a family to me who take care of you every step of the way.  I am remodeling my entire home, complete with alternative systems, room additions, and interior/exterior finishes.  Six months of being displaced and watching my home being rebuilt from start to finish.  I made the right decision when selecting SOD Home Group.  They are professional, experienced, and personable.  Half way through the job and I’m still feeling good about my decision."
5,"Oren, Eden and Daniel were wonderful professional people and that we hired for our room addition at our house and to our kitchen project. They were very interested in suggestions we had and very amenable to incorporating them. Nothing of the project was too much for them. They took each and any of our ideas and implemented them into the work while making sure to stay in the range of the budget. The room addition project that we hired them for was to remodel the kitchen and living room space at our house. We will be very happy to hire them again in the future. They are real professional people."
5,"We recently had a room addition built at our house. Our addition project started before the COVID-19 situation and it was managed by Oren, and we couldn’t have asked for more skilled and communicative contractor. From the beginning, he was with us, guiding us on how to plan out our addition that will fit our budget, and explaining us all the stages and processes involved. Oren set the timeline for the start of the construction, and what would be involved, and he also provided us with many ideas on best practices that would result in a highest end quality for our budget. The working teams were professional and always polite, and they were very receptive and responsive to any of our questions and issues we had. From A to Z, the addition project was perfect, and on target. We are very happy with the final results. We will definitely be calling up Oren for any future remodels, and we would not hesitate to recommend him to friends and family."
5,"Oren at SOD Home Group is highly recommended! He seriously was able to fix the problems of another contractor who decided to stop in the middle due to complicity of the project. Most of all he can do many things with a high degree of quality. This is HIGHLY recommended handyman! Thanks, Oren for all the great work you have done in my home and will definitely hire again."
5,"What a complete pleasure to work with! SOD Home Group were reasonable prices, efficient, honest and cared about my home. They did such an outstanding job! They were ON TIME and super knowledgeable.  We really love hosting our friends and family in our home, our kitchen was a separate room facing the backyard, so we had architectural plans made to add a large family room on the expense of our backyard, and open the kitchen to the new family room. It took SOD Home Group about 3 months to finish the job and we couldn’t be happier.  If you are looking for honest and talented contractors at fair prices, then SOD Home Group is exactly what you are looking for."
5,"Oren and his skilled team at SOD Home Group were the most professionals, polite and skilled people while Oren the contractor was such a great supervisor that we worked with during our large remodeling project that included the kitchen, bathrooms, and outdoor landscape project that was ended last week. The high quality and the installation of all the parts of the new kitchen were done as Oren promised to us and were finished exactly on time. Oren ideas and help were very useful from the layout design aspect. They made our dream kitchen a reality."
5,"Oren at SOD Home Group did a STUNNING remodeling job for us. We basically redid our entire first floor that included the kitchen, guest bathroom, living room and dining room area and all of it looks gorgeous. Oren and his team of people were easy, polite, and honest people to work with, super responsive, and very affordable related to everybody else. They also painted the entire spaces, installed washer dryer hookups and installed our new wood flooring. We will hire them for forthcoming projects. Can’t wait!"
5,"I only have the highest praises for Oren, and his work. From the beginning, Oren displayed so much warmth and sincerity towards us. From the first consultation, he gave tremendous time and detail to what we could anticipate if we were to hire him for our project, a full bathroom remodel. He was never in a rush, so open to conversation, and actively listened to what our expectations were for our project. Oren always carried himself with utmost professionalism, while establishing and maintaining a personal relationship, with constant, open and timely communication. The entire process was incredibly smooth. Oren gave us direction each step of the way, allowing us to choose our style and shop within our budget. Everything was done is a timely fashion and the project was finished so quickly! Every person involved in the project was professional, and we did not feel that our privacy was invaded at any point. We could not be happier with the final result of the bathroom. We would recommend Oren to anyone looking to do any remodeling or reconstruction, and would definitely work with him in the future! Thank you Oren!"
5,"I'm writing this review because me and my husband were very happy with the work that they did!. Oren is a great person to work with and we felt that he is a professional person that tries hard to make us happy by doing a lot of things that we never included in the job even. The workers also were happy and they mentioned several times that they want to do this bathroom remodeling project on the best side. the project that they did for us included the new floor and replacing the shower with a large bathtub with stone walls all over the tub. In addition to that, we replaced all the light fixtures and the outlets/switches as well. We love the new bathroom and we do recommend this company."
5,"We hired SOD Home Group to convert our upstairs living room into a fully permitted bedroom, and we cannot be happier with how everything went, including the remodeling process and the outcome results. We truly recommend asking for Oren as the assigned project manager. Oren is smart, very professional and super reliable man when it comes to construction, communication and execution. We had few setbacks during the remodeling work and Oren stood up during all of them placing our priorities and comments on the top. The working crew who was assigned and worked on our remodeling project were very well trained, clean, honest, and they completed the remodeling project on the time frame Oren and his office set that. We honestly know that If we will ever have another remodeling project to do… We will definitely contact and hire SOD Home Group and mainly Oren."
5,"We had an excellent experience with SOD Home Group with this current remodeling project. Oren and his team remodeled and upgraded the kitchen at my house. Oren was the project manager and he was absolutely amazing person, very helpful and pleasant, answered all of our questions and was able to save us some money with his valuable advises. The remodeling project went smoothly, and he finished all of it on the promised time and within agreed price. We love the new kitchen, looks beautiful!"
5,"SOD Home Group transformed our house into a stunning new look and feel. Each and Every part and detail of this complete remodeling project was way far exceeded all of our expectations. The honesty, high quality of work, trustworthiness of all the working team members were beyond superior. Oren’s communications skills were the main plus and that on top of the staff from the main office who gave us the perfect feeling that this project is being done at her house! They all made sure that each and every stage of the work will be done no less than perfect. A full 10 thumbs up we want to give them without thinking twice."
5,"We had a really horrible experience with the previous contractor that started our project… and just left it in the middle due to workers problems… we were so lost that we didn’t know what to do. When we were referred to SOD Home Group, we really hoped for at least a better experience. Now that our project is finished… all we can say is that it was amazing and we are extremely happy!! SOD Home Group really knows what they are doing, they took over the project, listened to our original ideas and vision and stepped in right away to do it the right way! our master bathroom and kitchen start to take shape very fast and they went above and beyond their promises just to please us and to deliver what we wanted. Everything was done in a professional way and in a very timely manner while making sure to keep us in the loop during the remodeling process. We will be calling SOD Home Group for any future remodeling projects we will have. They were amazing!"
5,"We could not be happier with our recently remodeled home and our experience with Oren and his team. Before embarking on our remodel, we talked to many different contractors and while we liked a lot of them, we felt that SOD Home Group was the only one giving us a truly honest assessment of what was possible and the cost of it all. From our first conversation with Oren, we had complete trust— something we didn’t feel with many of the other companies out there. He’s a perfectionist, and anything that was not to our liking in any way he immediately fixed. Any unforeseen problem was handled in a way that actually left us happier than we were before. Their attention to detail and quality is incredible, and it shows in the work they do. Oren and his team transformed our house into an incredible place, and it was a pleasure working with them."
5,"We’ve used SOD Home Group for two projects 1 year apart. The first time we hired them, it was for a full back landscaping project - design, irrigation, plantings. Oren did an amazing work, kept to the promised (upon) budget and finished the entire project as scheduled. We loved the yard and received many complements. This year we decided to build a new pool, which required all new landscaping work. This time around, in addition to having design, irrigation and planting needs, our ideas included fencing, benches, BBQ island as well with slopes and varying elevations. Oren was amazing and he pulled all of our ‘preferred’ and ‘want’ into a stunning design plan that met our budget and Oren and his team executed the design perfectly. Once again, in addition to the enjoyment we receive from our beautiful backyard, our friends and family have nothing but complements as well.  We highly recommend SOD Home Group."
5,We just finished our remodeling project with SOD Home Group who did a stunning remodeling work at our house by completely demolished the existing kitchen and to build the new designed one. Oren was the main person that we dealt with during the entire work and he made sure that everything will go according to the plan. He also managed all the people who worked at the house (close to 15 different people) while the office made sure that all the orders and deliveries will be handled in the most professional way. We wanted to have our new kitchen project finished before the new year and Oren promised that it will and we can write here that he did fulfill his promise. highly recommended company!
5,We hired them during the COVID-19 to remodel our kitchen and living room. Oren managed the remodeling project from start to finish while he MADE sure to follow all the safety measures including the cleaning after each day of work. the project took a little longer than we thought but we totally understand that. the delay caused due to the extra safety measured that they took. Highly recommended company mainly during this hard time.
5,"I can't say enough about how great SOD Home Group was to work with. I priced out kitchens everywhere and decided IKEA was the best product for the price, but was intimidated by the designing, and installing process. Once I discovered SOD Home Group I knew it would be helpful, but after going through the process, I can't imagine doing it without them. Their design was great and the detailed measurements, pictures and parts list were so important. Whenever people see our kitchen, I make sure to tell them about SOD Home Group as I believe they were such an integral part of making our kitchen reno successful. We saved thousands of dollars going with IKEA, so it was well worth the investment in SOD Home Group to make the process so much easier. Thank you SOD Home Group!"
5,"I found SOD Home Group and its team who managed by Oren to be a very experienced, knowledgeable and creative asset to the remodeling project of our kitchen, living room, laundry room and guest bathroom. During the work, Oren was available for all of our questions/concerns and he also helped us with all the issues that were raised up during the work and we are very satisfied with our beautiful new remodeling project."
5,"As a Realtor my responsibility is to my clients. When my sellers wanted to do improvements to their investment property in preparation for Sale we chose SOD Builders for the job they were AMAZING! they took all the headache out of the renovation they acquired the permits, offered insight to the design and materials and even when we hit budget snag they were able to accommodate David and his team were super professional and skilled. The property sold before ever hitting the market while under construction and was over our target price all cash 7 day close. Everybody was happy. Will definitely call on them when I have another project. And so should you."
5,"Oren at SOD Home Group was very professional and helpful from the early stage of the project all the way to end of it. The customer service that was given to me was impeccable. During the work, I had several adjustments and changes and Oren addressed all of them without questioning any of them. I would recommend SOD Home Group and Oren’s staffs in the future."
5,"After purchasing our second investment house, we wanted to update the house since it was still stuck in the in the old remodeling style. We did not know where to start or what to do and after a lot of research we were referred to SOD Home Group by a friend that did their entire house with them. We didn't know what to expect. After 30 mins of our meeting we were in love with David’s ideas and suggestions to improve the layout and finishes of our new kitchen, master bathroom and guest bathroom. He was very professional and spent almost 4 hours with us showing us his beautiful designs and completed projects from his previous clients. We decided to hire him and we are so happy that we did. David came up with an amazing 3D concept design (that looked much real then the actual spaces) for each space that we wanted to remodel. He managed the remodeling project from start to finish and with the final decoration of the home. Our house looks amazing and our kitchen is, now, huge and has an island to die for. Our master bathroom is like a high-end spa at a five-star hotel. We are really thankful to the team from SOD Home Group for making our home an amazing place for our family."
5,"SOD group was great to work with. We did our master bathroom remodel, full house carpet, and some special electrical work with them and it was a great experience from start to finish. They were on time and followed through with every promise. Doing the project during Covid added extra challenges and they were extremely, safe, responsible and respectful of our space. Their contractors were all excellent and also very respectful. We highly recommend them. Ben, Eden, and Micah were a fantastic team."
5,"Thank You Oren and the Team at SOD Home Group! We just completed our bathroom remodeling & we really love it each and every day! After our research that included several other companies, we decided to hire SOD Home Group. Oren told us all about the entire service that they provides, their past expertise in working with home projects, getting all the permits, design, materials and fixtures, electrical, through to the actual work and the final step of clean up. They seriously were able to handled it all! Oren was our main person that we worked with and he gave us a beautiful, modern bathroom design plans which was what we envisioned. Oren was really great person! He was there with us every step of the way. He answered all our questions (we really had many lol) because this was our first remodeling ever. The SOD Home Group team really took care of everything! We have already referred two couples who are looking to do complete remodeling of their houses."
5,"I highly recommend working with SOD Home Group. Our remodeling project included a complete kitchen remodeling, the removal of a wall, the removal and installation of new floors throughout the entire house, the replacement of the electrical rewiring, and several other upgrades to our old flip house. Oren and his team transformed the house into a stunning modern lovely place. Our old and ancient kitchen is now so beautiful, and we love using it and spend a lot of time cooking in it! we were continually impressed by the high quality of the work they did. The remodeling project was finished on time even though we had few numbers of difficulties along the work. All the workers came to work on time and were also very polite. Each time we asked any changes, touch-ups, or adjustments Oren returned to us right away to make sure we were pleased with the work. We also appreciate all the help they offered in making design options during the remodeling project. Overall, we had a wonderful experience working with Oren, and we will definitely hire SOD Home Group again for future projects!"
5,"We really IN LOVE with our kitchen. Oren and his team and office staff were artistic, clean, resourceful and respectful, and more than that – really true professionals. Oren met with us at our house and listened to what we wanted (and mainly needed) and offered many ideas/suggestions that we really appropriated. We now have a newly kitchen, very functional, warm, inviting and absolutely gorgeous kitchen that we wanted for a long time now! We had such a positive experience; I have recommended Oren and SOD Home Group to our friends."
5,"We interviewed and spoke to a lot of construction companies for our master bathroom and kitchen remodeling project and we ended up by hiring SOD Home Group.What a great and professional people of no less than sensational skilled people! We couldn’t be happier from the whole work that they did for us at our house. They were absolutely honest, fast phase, and very experience while they always kept guidance and advise us during the work which was fantastic, and huge plus. Oren, our project manager was wonderful! We are so happy with the final results of the work which was leading me to also have them redo my flooring.
Thanks a lot!"
5,"Oren and his crew from SOD renovated my house and they just complete the entire remodeling last week. The complete home remodeling that they did came out stunning and we are stunned by the way our house turned out. Oren managed and handled the whole remodeling project on a daily basis but…
a.He made sure that the project will be finished on time and within the budget
b.He made sure that each day the workers will have all they need in order to finish the daily and weekly tasks (and not before he personally inspected it)
c.He made sure that all the materials will be at the house at least 1 day before the workers will need them for the upcoming task.
We are so appreciative of the work that was done by the SOD teams and we are very comfortable to hire them again in the future for any additional remodeling that we may have."
5,"SOD Home Group is an excellent company, and we are confident that no other company in our country could have done a better remodeling job with our kitchen and first floor. Our remodeling project was supposed to be the kitchen space only, with a hardwood floor refinish and painting the walls. Working with Ezra, our project manager, and Oren, the designer, was very easy and productive. Ezra was extremely knowledgeable about the overall project and we are confident he did the best he could to provide us with accurate, and honest advices about the some issues when they came up. He earned our trust by consistently advocating on my behalf. He was very helpful and took pride in their work. Oren has a great eye for detail, a really heartening can-do attitude, and a hilarious amount of enthusiasm. She really knows design, and our house is significantly much more beautiful because we listened to him. SOD Home Group was great at communicating and has a good system for invoicing and change orders. They’re a steady, logic, and generally good construction company. We are confident any issues we had with them would have been issues with most other construction companies. Oren and Ezra definitely made an impression on my wife and I, and we would be happy to work with them in the future."
5,"We had a great experience working with SOD Home Group, our project manager Oren. The renovation was literally problem free (this is actually our second remodeling project so we knew that we will have some issues along the way but with this remodeling… all the problems were resolved fast and painlessly... we are very happy with how our remodeling project came out and we love using the beautiful and well-designed kitchen. We definitely recommend using SOD Home Group’s team and office staff because everything was made to fit our needs; it also went much faster than we thought it will be. We also loved that they were able to handle everything from A-Z including the cabinets, flooring, appliances and countertops and the price was reasonable for the quality of the products."
5,"For a while, we searched for a company that can remodel our kitchen and master bathroom. Our past experience with construction companies was ‘OK’ and we learned from our mistakes. SOD Home Group was recommended to us by some people who we know and they were very happy with Oren, his work and his team. From the idea to completion Oren was creative, skilled and professional person to have. Our challenge was that we were at home during the remodeling and we were very impressed by the preparation work that they did before the demolition started! The communication, care and dedication from the team was amazing. We were not used to this style of support from them! The result of the remodeling is what we really dreamed about, plus!"
5,"Oren, from SOD Home Group, remodeled our kitchen and all the upstairs bathrooms. He did an amazing job which included all the design elements that we really wanted, and he also came up with many great solutions to our initial wishes, all with wonderful style. The new kitchen is stunning and very practical. Now that we finish the work with them, we can say that Oren and his team are very trustful people and they can make anyone remodeling dreams come to life. Thanks, Oren for your amazing remodeling job!"
5,"From the planning stage, to the completion of all the permits from The building & safety department the remodeling project of our house… the work that was made by our contractor Oren (from SOD Home Group) was much more than just ‘excellent’. The results of all the spaces at our house (Kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms etc..) ended with a classy, very efficient, super comfortable 3 bedrooms 2.5 baths house with stunning rooms and beautiful features. Oren is a truly master contractor and his way of work made us fall in love with him."
5,"SOD Builders Group finished the conversion of our garage into a guest room that included a small kitchen, bathroom and living space. The remodeling project took 2.5 months and it was based on a daily basis work under the supervision of Oren and Odelia (from the office). Each stage started only after Oren personally visited our house and confirmed that the previous stage was complete. This way of work made our remodeling so easy, stress-less and easy. Shril on the other hands.... made sure that all the orders, delivers and invoicing will be no less than perfect and she made sure that everything will be ready for the teams at least 1 day before they will move to the next stage. 
Each week we had several conversations with Oren regarding the progress and we were in the loop at any time during the work.
we are very happy with SOD Builders Group and we will hire them again in the future."
5,"We want to thank SOD Home Group for all the hard work that they did at our house AND while we were out of the house while the work took place. Issac met with us several times before the work started and he handled the project like it was his house... he made sure that the teams will arrive to work each day and that the daily and weekly tasks will be completed while he inspects them personally. More than that he always informed us with all the details, pictures and videos about the work progress. We highly recommend SOD Home Group for any home remodeling project!!!!"
5,"We used SOD builders to completely remodel an old house. It ended up being a big project, and SOD/Oren was great to work with. They are very dedicated to making the customer happy. And while there was some delays and heartaches along the way (understandably for such a big project ), we are very happy with end result. What is more, they even came back a year later to fix some minor issues that had cropped up. That is amazing customer care. Thanks to Oren and Team."
5,"It's always a pleasure to work with SOD Builders. Oren's knowledge in the field is very impressive and he brings such an added value to each project. The SOD Builders team is a group of professionals, easy to communicate with and their attention to detail is impeccable. Oren's work ethics are rare to find nowadays; honesty, integrity, and quality. If he promises something, he will deliver on it. To say that I have been impressed with the level of service they provide their clients with will be an understatement. Our projects together always turned out to be a huge success with referrals from those clients. Therefore, I highly recommend SOD builders to homeowners who are looking to remodel their homes with peace of mind."
5,"We really love the new bathroom that was remodeled by Oren and his workers. We worked with Oren from start to finish and by doing that, we had no hassle or many people to talk to about anything related to the project at our house. The old bathroom was too old and we wanted to have a new look by replacing and installing everything including the new shower and floor. From the moment we signed and paid the initial payment, Oren made sure to take care of everything and only informed us with the relevant information including, the arrival of any delivery or to go and select the materials. The new bathroom was completed after 3 weeks of work and the last week of the work was to fix and correct the minor issues that we had."
5,"Our recent experience with SOD Builders was a long distance remodeling project relationship thing. We hired them for our project before we moved into the home (because we are out of state). As part of their work, they installed new floor around the entire house, totally remodeled the guest bathroom including some major upgrades to the master bathroom. Due to our situation, many of the design details were discussed and agreed over the phone and by emails while most of the remodeling work was even done without us visiting the house and seeing the progress. Oren definitely made this ‘almost’ stress and super difficult work entirely easy and nice. We had our total trust and confidence in them and the team that worked made us feel that we are in awesome hands during the process. The high quality work and the time frame that took them to finish the work…made us so pleased with the decision to hire them and we felt it right after we finally moved in. We recommend SOD Builders for their excellent services, high quality and also because they are truly a pleasure people and company to work with."
5,"SOD Builders was hired to remodel our house that we just purchased los Angeles area. We are very confident to recommend them because many different reasons but for the sake of this review… we’ll just mention some of them. 
- They were very dedicated to provide us with the required results of the work.
-They were multipurpose and flexible during the work even if it was a small modification that we wanted to do.
- They were open and honest with us about how long specific stages of the project will take.
- They were professional when it came to the designs and layout of the remodeling. Our project manager (Oren), the designer and the office were very involved in our project making for a unified project.
With the points above… our project turned out to be a stress free construction project. The remodeling was the main thing that turned our house into a new property. We are so happy with the new our and we can’t wait to hire them again in the future for a pool remodeling project. We are fully satisfied with  the beautiful work executed by SOD Builders!"
5,"We had a townhouse remodeled and it included all the upper and lower cabinets in the kitchen, master bathroom redesign and remodeled & guest bathroom downstairs with new marble counter tops,  faucets, double sinks, wall mirrors & recessed lights on top of new layer of paint and electrical work.  The whole remodeling project final costs was much less than we originally budgeted and it was finished much faster than we planned. Our biggest concern was that we couldn’t be there physically to oversee the daily work because we live in another city and we relied on the experience, honesty and professionalism of Oren, his team of people.  They both kept us up to date on the progress of the work & each day they sent us pictures of the work that was performed each day. We are happy with the ideas that they came up with during the work and we would highly recommend them.  Many thanks to the whole SOD Builders crew for an excellent remodeling job."
5,"SOD Builders gets my high score for being so skilled, honest and professional during the entire pool construction that we recently had at our house. We always talked about getting a nice pool, but we needed to have specific requirements before starting the work. The SOD Builders team made sure to stand behind certain standards prior taking on this pool project and this made us feel so comfortable and secure that we decided to hire them and moving forward. Within few months, Oren and the team had the pool construction complete and now it is really a proud project to see and use. We couldn’t asked for a better construction company than SOD Builders to design and build our dream pool. We highly recommend SOD Builders for anyone who is looking to bring a remodeling project to life."
5,"When I decided to go with SOD Builders, Oren and his team including the office staff did a great work by remodeling our kitchen (I must mention that this was not an easy remodeling project because of space issues). The kitchen space turned out to something that is gorgeous and super functional. On top of that, Oren helped me with the selection of all the materials.  me and my family really love the overall service at SOD Builders. they always were there for me, always answered to all my questions even when I had a problem during the work, Oren sent someone at night to fix the problem. I must mention that all of my questions/concerns were always answered in a timely and professional manner. I highly recommend SOD Builders for any kitchen remodeling project."
5,"We convert the garage into a guestroom that is 550 sq/ft in size. We hired Oren and his company at SOD Builders to do that after he was able to give us a great price on the materials and the labor. Oren was able to include all the items that we wanted to have in the space and this included a small closet, kitchen and bathroom. What we loved was the fact that Oren designed, estimated and executed everything including the paint colors and textures of the floor and he was able to bring us several samples with combinations of what we should do. The bedroom was remodeling was completed after 3 months and the end results are awesome."
5,"Oren at SOD Builders did a perfect work with the 4 bathrooms project at our house. Oren was professional and very polite to us and he had a lot of patience towards his workers and the vendors that worked as well. The bathrooms that we remodeled (Master bathroom, 1 guest bathroom and 1 jack and jill) included a long vanity with 2 sinks and faucets, New stone floor with nice design, Paint and all the hardware that installed on the doors, walls etc... The bathrooms that we have included a shower and bath tub. All of them have been included in the remodeling and we love the new look."
5,"We had such a wonderful experience with SOD Builders all the way from the design during the actual work  installation and final check list of our remodeling project with the team. Oren on the supervision side of the work were wonderful people when it came to ideas, planning and execution. The workers were superb and perfect problem-solvers. After the work was completed, Oren stayed in touch with us in order to be sure that we were very satisfied and happy with the complete work (kitchen, 2 bathrooms and the entry of the house). Highly recommend!"
5,"Oren at SOD builders came over to our house (we got his contact information from a coworker who just hired them for a large-scale remodeling project). he measured the kitchen and bathroom and took some pictures in order to generate a great design for the spaces. His design looks very nice and we hired him for this work. He brought also one of his workers to take a look and see if he would like to change or modify anything. 
the work was divided to sections:
1. demolition of the existing one
2. move some lights and outlets
3. patch and fix the walls
4. paint the kitchen 
5. install the cabinets
6. install all the lighting fixtures
7.install the counter tops, sink and faucet
8. install the appliances 
9. do some touch ups of the paint.
during the work, we had no issue with any of the employees. 
they did their work and made sure to move everything before work."
5,"We used SOD Builders for a remodeling project recently and I cannot recommend them highly enough. They did awesome work at all stages of the remodeling project, from drafting to design to the actual work. On top of that, they were very friendly and nice people to work with. My remodeling project included: New kitchen, new hardwood flooring and paint of the entire house, in addition to some minor bathroom updates. From the beginning, the design team made me feel at ease with their wonderful suggestions and attention to all the detail. Working with them really felt as a collaborative effort. They very open to my ideas, implementing the good ones and explaining the differences. In addition to designing the cabinetד, they helped me select all the appliances, flooring, paint. The team was top-notch. They were friendly, skilled, hardworking and excellent craftspeople. The whole remodeling project was completed within our budget and just a little bit over time… but that’s because we added more things during the work. Were thrilled with how things turned out!"
5,"We had the pleasure working with SOD Builders and the team. Our remodeling ended up much better than what we wanted. The remodeling involved tear down a wall, brand new kitchen, 2 bedrooms, the back entry of the house and also the front entrance. The office staff, the designer and the working people were very personable and easy people. We had the vision for the front entry and Oren with his team were able to build a mock up so we could feel how the final look will turn out. They always arrived to work on time, worked with the budget and provided wonderful recommendations when issues and problems came up. We will hire them again for all of our future remodeling projects."
5,"It was a pleasure to hire SOD Builders our big remodeling project at our main living house! We had no problems, issues, delays, of missing days during the work with any of the workers, supervisor (Oren) that worked at our house NOR with any of the office staff. The remodeling project that included the kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms and garage AND the outdoor kitchen came out nice and perfect and within 4 months from the day we hired them and the day the work got started! We are very happy, lucky and fortunate to have SOD builders at our house."
5,"We were happy with the estimate that we got from Oren about our guest bathroom, Kitchen, Garage and few other items at our house. Oren was nice to us during the remodeling and he communicated with us on each step of the remodeling. His workers and his supervisor came every day to work and they were nice people as well. Over all, The new bathroom looks good and nice and we are pleased with the quality of the work that SOD Builders did."
5,"I have hired SOD Builders on major repair and renovation project for my damaged house that got damaged after a fire damage. The customer service and attention that I got from this company and mainly from the actual people that worked at my house was outstanding and I would highly recommend them with my eyes closed to anyone that need to any remodel any house that have this type of damage. Here is with my own words of why and what they did at my house that caused me to write this review and recommendation about them: 
a.Honest & ethical: From the first time I called them till the moment the final payment was done, I noticed that all they care was to make sure to do the work on the best side and not to try and find reasons to earn more and more money. During the work itself, there were additional problems that were found and most of them were taken care of without even letting me know or to try and charge me for additional money.
b.Budget – The work was divided to 2 sections... section 1 was for the first time they arrived to my house and tried to save as much as possible things. And the second time was for the complete work that needed to be done in order to make the house as a living house. In both things, the amount that was set, was fixed and didn’t changed and more than that. On the second stage, the budget that was set didn’t raised or included any hidden charges.
c.On-time: They give realistic timeframes and realistic quotes. They may not the cheapest or fastest, but you can be sure and confident that they're costs will be reasonable and that they will complete the job without any hesitation or concern when they promise and within budget.
d.Great working skills and extremely ethical working people: The people at SOD Builders were able to provide me with excellent ideas about the new repairs. Because of the damages, I have the opportunity to redesign the kitchen mainly and the first floor of the house.
e.Great people! The company assigned to my house several people that did the actual work and they were managed and supervised by Oren. Oren was the most serious person that we dealt from the company and all he cared was to make sure that the work is being done on the most perfect side and without any problem. The rest of the people were excellent people."
5,"We were satisfied with our previous contractor who remodeled our master bathroom but this time he wasn’t available to do it due to some family reasons and we wanted to remodel the rest of the bathrooms including the kitchen so we started to make our research and to find a good contractor. Our neighbor hired SOD Builders recently and he showed us his remodeled bathroom and it was amazing so we asked for the phone number of SOD Builders. We called them and spoke to Christin who was very nice to us, she was able to schedule the meeting with Oren and to start the work within a week and a half after. The price was fair and we hired them. The remodeling project took 8 weeks, which was within a promised time frame. They did a very good job, and the quality of all the finished products were at highest level and it looks beautiful. We truly can’t ask for more. Very Professional contractor, We will recommend and hire their service again – for sure!"
5,"In one word,  WOW!
Oren Dagan and SOD Builders has far exceeded our expectations with their outstanding customer service, design team, and quality of work. They have been so wonderful to work within our home remodeling in Westlake Village. Their team has been prompt, patient, and professional in dealing with my wife and me in our crazy time. They have team, great eye for the most up to date trends and trades yet have been very practical in dealing with our budget and the fact we have four young children under the age of ten. The whole staff from top to field to the office has been great, and I would recommend them to anyone looking for the (one word) WOW experience."
5,"We had the privilege to work with Oren and the fantastic team of SOD Builders as we were building our new home in Palo Alto. Their talented architects, project manager, office stuff,  design team, site emplyees, and subcontractors covered all aspects and details of our new home. They created a caring friendship and with us as their clients and worked with us to achieve comprehensive coverage of all the details from the initial building plans to furnishings and accessories. Their design team took the time to review our lifestyle and really listened to our likes and dislikes, their production team communicate to us throw the app on a daily basis and were always there to make us feel safe and confident while demonstrating an unmatched customer service level to ""under promise and over deliver."" as Oren told us in the beginning.  They carefully worked alongside our family in the decision-making process resulting in an experience that exceeded our high expectations in the quality of craft and overall design, but they also came on a budget! 
 
They worked tirelessly to place neat and clean, hang pictures, accessorize beyond belief.
Their concierge team kept surprised us, make us feel special and unique, and at the same time, they made sure we are safe and on our side. The experience was beyond belief and could not have been more seamless as every consideration of detail was checked and rechecked. 
 
 Oren, Michal, Kathy, Rose Tomy, Mario and the entire team of SOD Builders, took our fantastic house and gave the welcoming, warm feel of a family home that we can be proud of. Our family is forever grateful for all their help and will not hesitate to use them again in the future. Thank you, family!"
5,"We had an excellent redesign and installation of our kitchen and 3 bathrooms at our house and a complete makeover of the garage. The materials and final products used were high end and we are thrilled of the new look throughout our home. We really appreciate all the attention that was invested in all the details, the professionalism and the passion to accommodate our needs. We were treated with lots of respect and compassion as they always answered to each and every question we had AND they made lots of efforts to pleased us. Recently we called Oren to check and see if he can take care of an electrical problem that we had in our kitchen. Oren did not think twice to send his people and to provide us with a very fast service. We will call on Oren and his ‘Luxcess Home by SOD Builders’ crew again and again!"

It wasn’t until I called that I was told their schedule was booked and that I’d need to reschedule. In the future a more considerate approach would be to call and explain the last minute cancellation then request for a reschedule."

5,"We had a great experience with Luxcess Home by SOD Builders... Before we started the conversion of our 2 car garage, we researched and shopped around for few months until we went ahead with Luxcess Home by SOD Builders. Because we are a picky people, we went physically to see several remodeling jobs that they did recently. We were impressed but also worried at the same time. Based on what we saw, we felt that our estimate will not fit our budget and that we will not be able to afford it. The sales rep delivered us the quote and spent 5 hours with us. He didn’t push us to sign the contract and more than that, he didn’t try to persuade us. We took all the information he gave us and few days after, we called him and agreed to talk over the weekend. Shortly after that day, we called him and scheduled the meeting at our house. The price for the work was fair and we felt that we are in good hands. We signed the agreement and a week after, the project started. We converted the garage (about 500 sq/ft) to an amazing single room including a bathroom & steam shower, small laundry area and a kitchen. Everything came out perfect. The additional unit blend well with the rest of the house and all of our friends including our family members that visited us after the work was completed, could not believe how nice the new space… They were able to deal with all the challenges that the project included and how the new hardwood floor installation was blended to the house as a one long hardwood floor Hallway .We are very happy with the results"

5,"Overall the project went very well. We chose SOD Builders because their price was competitive, but more importantly their timeframe was quick. Our priority was the completion date because my wife is pregnant, and we needed the house to be move in ready before the baby arrived. The beginning design phase took longer than expected and made us nervous if the estimated completion date would be met. However once the project started and we were assigned our Project Manager Udi, everything moved quickly. Udi kicked ass. He was on top of scheduling crews at the house every day, inspections, and correcting minor changes my wife and I wanted. All said and done our house was completed on time. The project included full kitchen remodel, bath remodel, electrical, plumbing, hardwood/tile flooring, fireplace refacing, and paint throughout. From the beginning of demo to completion was 2 months which is an impressive turn around time for a full interior remodel. We pretty much have a new house to start a new family and we are very happy"
5,"The entire project that included so many item at my house was designed and managed by Gal of SOD builders, with a design that was created by input from me and installed by his several professional teams. The project contained the full remodeling of the kitchen, dining room and living room. All new cabinets (from diamond cabinets) were installed, red hardwood floors, custom cut marble counter tops, back splash, new appliances, under counter sink and all the rest of the items that required for this remodeling project. The entire remodeling work took about 7 weeks from beginning to end and I was able to live in the house during the whole work. The construction teams were so professional and reliable and made sure to do everything according to the plan while Gal managing and monitoring the daily and weekly tasks and making sure that they are coming out in perfect condition. They also made always sure to clean at the end of each day. At the end of the project, I must say that the project had a fabulous outcome and is certainly a top quality. I don't feel I could have had a better outcome from any other contractor. It was just great!!!!!"

5,"SOD builders is an excellence home remodeling company that for sure will works very hard for their clients! We have met with Adam on our large scale remodeling project at our new house that we recently purchased. In the past, we hired him on some remodeling projects and we were very happy with his work while this time is no difference and he was able to bring to life our vision and design. He was very committed to our project and we noticed how much he cares for everything. His work with his crew was very tight and it worked like a charm. No problem or issue was left alone during the work and each part of the work was ended only after he physically checked it and approved it. Our large scale remodeling was to remodel the kitchen, bedrooms and bathrooms. The kitchen needed to be redesigned and Adam came up with some great ideas that left the house in an open space design that each section of it was separate from the other one while in the meantime, there was no large walls that showed the separation. The work was completed after 2 months of a day by day work and each day, we had at least 6 people working together at the house, each one on a different section. We are very happy with the complete results of the work and we want to thank them all here in this review. Thank you Adam and everyone who was involved in our house remodeling."
5,"Allen at SOD builders done wonders at my home. I needed several projects to be done and I just could not decide where to start. I wanted to upgrade the kitchen and bathrooms and to upgrade the living room area. So I asked around all my friends & family for any referral and one of my friends, referred Allen to me. Because it was a big remodeling that involved a lot of money, I searched and checked about him and his company before hiring him and paid my hard-earned money. On my first meeting with Allen, I was the one that did most of the talking and he just listened and took his notes about my taste, goals and more... Allen helped me to prioritize what to start first which was a huge help to organize my thoughts and to understand that it is better to start with something but to do it on the best side. So after that meeting, I decided to remodel the living room, bathroom and kitchen area. Allen planned and helped me with all the stages of this work and he even went with me personally to select materials. The only minus thing that happened was that the finishing date did not end on the scheduled date (which is ok and normal for this size of remodeling). The quality of work, craftsmanship and perfection in the design & completion, on top of the service that I got was remarkable. I always got answers to my questions and comments. All the involved workers and sub-contractors came on time each day and never caused any problem. Allen had always found the time to pass by and check their work and progress. There were some problems during the work, but Allen and all the workers were there to address it right away and solve it. I know I could not achieve that results of my work with any other Company. So thank you Allen for the wonderful job & until the next remodeling."
5,"Oren and his skilled team of professionals made our dream remodeling of kitchen, living room and laundry room. From our first appointment with Oren, continued to the demolition stage all the way to the completion of the work, the whole team and involved people of SOD builders were expert, honest, highly motivated people and well organized. Any issue that was raised along the way… was addressed correctly and handled in a professional manner and we were always informed of the progress, deliveries and installations of our project. We must state that our remodeling project was also priced right and our price didn’t change during the remodeling. This was something very important for us and we are happy that it stayed that way. We felt like we were in great hands and we will definitely call on them again for any future projects."
5,"I have not had the pleasure of hiring Ehud at SOD builders for upgrading my landscape plantings, build a new fire pit with seating area, replace all the existing backyard floor with new stamp concrete one, Adding an awning system that will be useful during summer time and mainly to add a nice BBQ spot. I was very happy with SOD builders and I was a somehow concerned how this whole work will come out. After the first few days of the actual work, I knew that the work will be done on the best side and Ehud will deliver exactly what I wanted. My backyard is now done and it has never looked so beautiful than it is right now. Ehud did a wonderful job and his planning and understanding what I want was fully worth it! More than that, Ehud spent almost a week with us to find the right materials for this work and this part was the worst part BUT at the end… I appreciated all the time and affords that he put into this part of the work. Ehud was really on top of everything and he did so much just to see how I’m pleased and happy with the work and progress. All the people that did the actual work were easygoing, resourceful, and skilled and were willing to spend the extra time by making sure that perfection will be the right definition for the work they do and they always found the time to talk with me about issues or problems that happened. The cost for this awesome project was very reasonable. I do recommend anyone to hire and use SOD builders."
5,"During the years and each time we moved to a new house, we have hired many contractors and we did had satisfied results with most of them, so we knew what to look for when we need to hire a good contractor when we need one. SOD builders was one of the contractors that we hired in the past and we were very happy with them and they were top notch with excellent results. As soon as we hired them this time, the remodeling project passed all of our expectations. We hired them to remodel our backyard and kitchen including the replacement and installation of 5 windows that 1 of them required them to expand the wall in order to create a new balcony sliding door. Before the work started, Allen and the office staff ordered all the materials and they started the work like a week before they all arrived to the house. The first thing that started the work was the demolition of the existing spaces, framing, plumbing, electrical, new cabinets (upper and lower), lighting fixtures, stamp concrete on the back yard part, tile, drywall, new paint and the installation of all the appliances. They worked fast, professionally, and flawlessly. Every day we noticed a change in the progress and the workers came on time and they stayed until they finished the daily tasks. We never had any complaint or problem with anyone that was involved at the remodeling project. The new kitchen was completed on time, within the budget and in a professional manner. We love the new kitchen and the stamp concrete in the back yard!"
5,"When we hired SOD builders to remodel the kitchen at our house, we were told by the people who referred us to them that they would stay on schedule and for sure on budget. Since we had 1 bad experience with our previous contractor, we were hesitating to believe it. Adam and his sub-contractors were without any doubt the most skilled, honest, trusty and reliable people we have ever met. They were polite and respectful to the fact that we were living in the house during the work and they made sure we were ok with everything. The remodeling spaces were neatly cleaned at the end of every day and left as little dust as possible in the rest of the house. Everything they did, was approved by us prior (on a daily basis) to be sure we were all on the same page. All and any issue that came up during the work, were addressed right away in a professional way. Adam and his contractors are truly the best in terms of workmanship, reliability and honesty."
5,"We had our bathrooms remodeled by SOD builders just recently! Our master bathroom was the most major turnaround from all the other bathrooms that we did. Our supervisor Adam among his team of people with his sub-contractors, were professional and productive. Adam worked hand by hand with us to reach an amazing results. His ideas and participation along with our spoken requirements ended in a really overwhelming results. Adam was able to generate for us a before & after designs so we can fell the transformation of how it will be after the work is complete. The work was performed while we were living at the house and their work was not interfering our day to day things. They worked clean and they made sure to protect all the spaces to prevent any type of damages. The work was done in a continuous manner with Adam regularly checking all phases of the job as it advanced! Punctuality was a main feature with him! We would have no doubts in referring him to anyone looking for an honest and reliable contractor!"
5,"From the first consultation meeting that we had with Adam all the way to the final walk thru of the remodeling project that was done by him and his crew, Adam was a great person to work with. The work that he did for us (A complete kitchen remodeling, bathrooms remodeling, laundry room upgrade and the 2 car garage) was done in fairly time and with high standards of quality. Every one of the crew members made sure that their part in the work was done to the high standards of the rest of craftsmanship that was defined and managed by Adam. During the remodeling project, we were provided with all the relevant information including solutions to raised problems that came up and all of our questions were answered in a professionally manner. Now that our project is complete and after working with Adam at SOD builders, we are sure that our house will serve our needs for many more years to come."
5,"SOD builders just finished a major kitchen remodeling project for us. Adam removed all the old floor and replaced it with new ¾ hardwood floor. On top of that, he refaced all the kitchen cabinets, took down a wall including some cabinets that were between the kitchen and living room and added a new overhead beam. The old countertop was also removed and a new marble countertop have been installed and polished. The dishwasher was relocated and replaced with a new stainless steel one. In the electric part of the remodeling we relocate several electrical switches and outlets and installed an overhead exhaust fan. We are very pleased and satisfied with all the work that Adam and his people did for us. Adam is careful, easy person to talk to and he did his best to keep the functionality of the kitchen for us as much as he could during the remodel. Everyone appeared at the house on time and mainly were focused only on the project. The kitchen was completed on time, but only due to the fact that they also worked extra time on Sundays too just to stay on time! More than that, during the remodeling, we came across few problems with the plumbing and electricity, but Adam was on top of it with the electrician and plumber so those issues were solved at no time. Adam’s schedule is pretty full but now we know how worth is the wait. We will not think twice to hire them again. We are very proud to write this review!"
5,"We are very proud and happy to write this great review for Oren and the whole team at SOD builders! We decided to select SOD builders out of 6 other home improvement companies that we met and talked to in regards to our home remodeling project. We much mention here that the other 2 companies were too rough and pushy people that all they wanted is to just make the sale and to have us signed on the contact which was the reason why we ended up not hiring them. This type of work was a big no for us and never want to deal with this type of people or companies. Oren was the exact opposite from that and his approach was first to understand what we want and what is our vision in regards to the kitchen and bathrooms that we wanted to have. After he understood that, he provided us with his ideas that were in fact nothing less than improvements on that and this was enough for him to come up with a 3D design that reflected the entire concept. Our kitchen and bathrooms came out much better than the definition of ‘Stunning’ and this is exactly what we wanted to get from anyone that we hired for our house. All the workers came to our house each day and on time while focusing on perfection and daily tasks, stayed on the agreed budget and schedule! We WILL hire them again for sure in the future for any home improvement project that we may have. High recommendations and perfect references! Great office staff and supervision!"
5,"Based on my recent experience with Adam with my kitchen remodeling, I can only write that I will recommend SOD builders to everyone I know. Prior for me hiring them, I got 3 other estimates and Adam was definitely my guy from the moment we ended our second meeting about the project. Adam was quick, qualified and easygoing. Before I wanted to go ahead with my remodeling, I knew more or less what I want to do and how I would like it to be done. Adam was very communicative and patient during the meetings and he heard everything I wanted to do and need even though it wasn’t an easy task. My kitchen space is medium size and had a lot of potential. Adam was able to implement most of my things and mostly to fit it within my budget. During my remodeling, I wanted to do some things that were out of his comfort zone. Adam connected me with his vendor who was able to do them as well and I was very happy for that as well. If I could write any word for my experience with SOD builders and mainly Adam, it would be ""WONDERFUL""!"
5,"I hired SOD builders for designing and do all the construction work for the front and backyard of my new house. Avi and his team were professional, more than responsible and they put a lot of attention to details and perfection during the whole work. Avi was extremely communicative and reactive, he always answered all the questions I had and he worked with me hand by hand to design, plan and deliver all of the things that I wanted to have for my landscaping project. His team was regularly at the home from start to finish. And the entire team at SOD builders made no hesitation to make sure that I was happy and pleased with the work they did. The company kept stuck to my budget and any change that could increase that number, was conditioned to my approval. Avi showed me all the available options that I can have prior of me making any choices from hardscape to plant selection and placement of features. This is a really devotion and this company have honesty and they do look and care to make sure that customers comes first and primary before making the money.  The whole team were creative in a way that they passionately shaped the backyard from an empty lot and converted it into a gorgeous outdoor living space that perfectly work for my family and friends. I would recommend them for sure over and over again and I will hire them again when we need any additional work done!"
5,"We are very happy with our kitchen remodel that was remodeled by SOD builders and supervised by Allen! During the remodeling, we honestly enjoyed working hand by hand with Allen. Part of our meetings prior to hire them, Allen came over with a stunning design designed of the new kitchen and the design was very impressive and exactly as the real kitchen which we are so proud of. The entire crew of workers were involved in the remodeling of the kitchen and the breakfast area and they were great people to work with during the whole time. Allen guided us each step of the way with his knowledge and ability. We can't write here all the compliments we get about the kitchen from all the people that come over and how their face look when they open the doors and see it for the first time! We truly enjoy spending time in the kitchen and the breakfast area now. Thank You, Allen and crew!!!"
5,"We recently hired (Adam) SOD builders to do a complete kitchen renovation at our house which includes painting, replacing the existing floor with new marble floors (24”x24”) and to upgrade the electrical wires and adding outlets and switches. Adam was the project supervisor and he did an excellent job with his professional crew, supervision the project, managing the work schedule and handling the sub-contractors. As part of his work, he sent us a daily report/update. We both work full days during the week and we were thankful that we could lean on Adam for this remodeling project. He also quickly understood our vision and the style we wanted while he did the hard work by searching and finding all the accessories for this job (lighting, marble tiles, faucets, cabinet pulls, and more...) so they all will match and fit. During the work, he was cautious to our budget and helped us solving several scenarios of problems in order to make them fit into the budget. We know that the highlight of our work with Adam was when he found and designed the tile backsplash which came out stunning, and he found a way to make this tile work within our budget. We hope to do work with him in the future on our patio project!"
5,"We worked with Gal from SOD builders to remodeling our master bathroom. We were looking for someone that can guide and help us with good ideas and options and mainly to listen to what we want or need. Gal was able to deliver all of that and even more! At first, He met with us and listened to what we wanted to do and he gave us some great suggestions that at the end he was able to implement them throughout the entire remodeling. Gal communicated with us in an excellent way and he was easygoing even though we made some changes or we couldn’t make a decision. We are very happy with our new master bathroom and Dan was the one that helped and guidance us. During the remodeling, Gal with his team came to work every day and on time, kept us informed and were patient with us. They worked on the master bathroom as if they were working on their own houses. It was a great practice and we will work with Gal again including recommend them to anyone we know. We are very happy with the end result and the process of getting there."
5,"We hired Allen from SOD builders to remodel our master bedroom and bathroom in addition to a small remodeling of a Jack and Jill bathroom. All people in the working crew were enjoyable people to work with. They were professional, skilled and came over to the house each day and on time. We am very precise about how things need to be accurate and neat OR in other words, it is hard to meet our expectations especially in the remodeling aspect. At the end of the work, our expectations were met. Our special requirements do cost and it’s hard to find someone that can actually do it right, but overall Allen was able to achieve it in a realistic price considering the value of actual work and materials. Our 2 bathrooms and the master bedroom are gorgeous and we enjoy showing them to our family and friends. We would not hesitate to use Allen or any of his workers in the future. Great work and thank you."
5,"We found SOD builders while they were working on a remodeling project in another house on the neighborhood. During that work, I approached the supervisor Allen and we asked him to see the work. After we saw what did do and how beautiful it is, we asked him to pass by our house and to see what we want to do and to give us a quote for the work. We wanted to remodel the kitchen and bathroom and also to paint the entire house. Allen came over and saw our house. He then went back to his office and did his homework including a 3D design. Dew days after, he called us and set an additional meeting with us to show us his ideas and prices. The remodeling project started a week after we agreed and signed all the documents and it took them less than a month to complete it. Allen did a wonderful work and he was able to implement most of the things we wanted. The kitchen came out beautiful and very functional while the bathroom got his new look and design. The final touch was the paint of the house which gave us a brand new look of the entire house. The whole remodeling was done in a very professionally manner. Allen put a lot of attention to all the details of the work. Thanks to Allen and entire crew that worked including the office staff for making our house look great!"
5,"We couldn’t be happier with the remodeling job that was made for us by SOD builders, under the supervision of Ehud. Ehud met with us several times before we hired him and he talked with us till he understood completely our goals and what we were trying to achieve with our remodeling. Ehud really listened and helped us finalize our project so it will fit with our opportunities and budget. This approach of Ehud gave us more trust in him and it was different from other contractors that we met because their approach was too rough for us and we didn’t like it at all. Ehud was also very familiar with the city codes and regulations, which saved a lot of time in drawing up the designs and money as well. Based on our meetings with Ehud, the office staff was able to come up with a wonderful 3D design which included most of our things and all we needed to do was to give it few touches till it was exactly what we wanted. The remodeling team and the sub-contractors were also professionals and polite while they gave a lot of attention to our schedule and preferences. In general, the whole team deserves this great review for the quality of the work they did for us. Our remodeling project was now a large one, but the time and affords SOD builders put into it, made us feel as very special clients."
5,"We recently hired Gal at SOD builders for a complete renovation of our kitchen, 2 bathrooms and master bedroom. Besides the fact that Gal not only finished the entire renovation on time and on budget, but the quality of it was more than wonderful and beat by far our hopes. Gal and the whole team including the sub-contractors were so skilled and available during the work and made it easy for us to stay living at the house while they were working. They were mainly careful with everything and they cleaned the working space daily and made sure it will be as safe as possible, not just at the end of the work. The most and important thing was that Gal answered each and every question or concern we had during the work and he always made sure that we were happy with each and any task of the work as they were installed. More than that, Gal and his crew were able to deal very professionally with any of the several surprises that came up during the work and they solved them always with minimizing our stress. We truly in love with all the remodeling that they did and with the fact that it was such an easy and stressful process that we are already considering how and what we will remodel in our next project."
5,"Oren from SOD builders was hired to create our dream house. We renovated two bathrooms, added an additional bathroom & laundry room and installed hardwood floors in all the bedrooms. We worked mainly with Oren. Oren was always reachable and reactive. He was creative and unbelievable from the design stage all the way to the actual construction. All of their workers and sub-contractors were generous, respectful, hardworking people with high reliability. Their cabinet maker person did beautiful work and was a pleasure to work with. During the work, there was a mold behind the old cabinets and our concern was that it will cause a major delay with the work. Oren made sure to take care of it with one of his vendors and they were tremendously helpful by solving that problem and keeping the project on track. The mold problem was an addition in price but Oren was able to get us the best deal with the mold remediation. Now that the remodeling is over, we can say that a lots of extra things were done for us and without any additional charge. A lot of them were just being done without even asking us. Oren was able to finalize the remodeling under budget and a little bit early than expected. Our house was treated as if it was their own. We are very pleased with the remodeling they did in the interior aspect of our house that we are currently in advance stage to work with them on the backyard and pool. We highly recommend selecting SOD builders for any project."
5,"We hired SOD builders to create an outdoor patio living space on our home. Oren and his workers were professional, organized, and very polite, offered a project plan, had an on-site project manager (Oren), and a team of well-seasoned, personable and talented sub-contractors who had worked together for years. They were trustworthy and communicated well throughout the entire project. There were never any surprises to the budget process and all was well-documented and shared throughout the progress of our project. We were able to work together as a team, sharing ideas, making any adjustments, and the results are a gorgeous outdoor space for my family to enjoy. We have great respect for Oren and Jacob. And, here is another example of how they stand behind their work -they just contacted us for a follow up even though the work has been completed few months ago. They wanted to have a walk through the addition to review any issues that may have arisen over the year since construction was completed so they could be fixed. I don’t know any contractor that offer such things to his clients. We will use SOD builders for all the other renovations we plan to do in our home. We know they will exceed our expectations on those too!"
5,"The house that we purchased is very nice and was not maintained for a while before we purchased it. The kitchen and the two bathrooms were too old and needed to have a complete renovation. Although we knew that beforehand (since the property was below value), we didn’t fully grasp the extent. Our main concern was that we had a limited budget for any of the repairs that we wanted to do. We were afraid that the repairs that we want to do will be too expensive and much more above the amount that we could afford. However, after investing a great amount of time in research, we realized the budget can be stretched right if we will find the right contractor. We have called a several contractors to come by and to give us a proposal for the remodeling of the kitchen and the 2 bathrooms. SOD builders was by far the best estimate for the remodeling.  It was a little over our budget, but we were happy to put up the extra money because we really liked the designs they gave us. Signing with Oren was very easy and after that was done, Oren was able to start the work immediately within few days. Oren, was on site nearly every day making sure everything is going well and according to the plan. The work crew came in each day and even when the weather turned bad and was extremely hot. We were surprised to find how neatly they made the remodeling site. Each day when they finish the work for the day they would clean up and prepare the space for the next working day. This made it really easy to walk around my house without bumping into things! They installed brand new marble counter tops in the kitchen, new cabinets and floor tiles. The bathrooms got a new coat of paint, double sided vanity and counter top. All of it fit comfortably with our budget. Everything looks new and even better than the rest of the house. Hopefully that will be remodeled soon too, and when it does I will definitely hire SOD builders again!"
5,"We hired SOD builders to perform a big remodeling of our home. The team and the sub-contractors that did the actual work, were professional, dependable and knew exactly what to do under the supervision of Oren and his foreman. The work went smoothly (at least as we know) and they were able to complete the work on time and without increasing the original budget (which to us it means a lot because it shows how professional this company is). Every job in that scale, has problems and issues that coming up during the work and as soon as walls are being taken down and to our opinion, the main key is to have a good company that can deals with them as they were minor issues or problems (and this can be achieved only by really professional ones). SOD builder’s staff and mainly Oren, were always there to respond and/or to provide a solution for anything that came across during the work. We are extremely happy with the final results of this project and we will recommend them to anyone who would like to do a new construction project or just to remodel any part of their house."
5,"After meeting in person and interviewing 4 construction companies and general contractors, we went ahead and hired SOD builders to do a major remodeling project at our house. We selected Oren because he had a great vision for design while implementing our ideas and wish list into the actual remodeling. Oren was also gave us a fair price for that work and we felt that we are in a good hands. Oren was able to provide us a detailed budget and mainly to give us a good schedule time for our remodeling work based on what we wanted to have. During our meetings with Oren, he was able to help us decide about some difficult design issues. Our project foreman, Michael was very pleasant person to deal with. Michael and Oren were very communicative with us and were able to answer all the questions we had during the work and even before we start and while they were working at the house, we got from them a weekly updates on the progress of the project and of each stage of it. All the concerns or problems that came up during the work, were quickly solved. During the work, Oren brought to the house several subcontractors (like electrician, plumber etc…). All of them were nice people and all they wanted was to do their part on the best side and under the quality rules of Oren. The work was finished a little bit over the schedule time that was assigned by Oren but most important, it was under the budget! The house turned out to be so beautiful and much more pleasant to be in! We will hire Oren and his crew again and we will definitely refer them to anyone planning a remodel."
5,"After questioning several construction companies to repair and renew our kitchen we were very impressed with SOD builders and are glad we hired them. Before retaining SOD builders, we questioned and appraised estimates that we received from other possible contractors. Most of them weren’t able to work around our ideas and visions for the kitchen design. There was something lacking in His presentation or they didn’t represent His companies or themselves as professionals who were willing to hear us. Most of the plans were designed on kitchen remodeling prototypes containing cabinets mounted in a straight line. They didn't grasp the concept of our kitchen and the end result we were trying to achieve. Oren Harel changed all that. He presented himself as professional, honest, dedicated to provide us with an excellence product. His work just proved to be very reliable by doing so. Oren was always willing to listen, take his time to really understand our ideas and to help us come up with the right plan for our dream kitchen. It was obvious that his professional history and experience gave him the ability to imagine our own ‘vision’. He had the ability to start with the end product in mind. The original contract was well prepared, well offered, fully clarified and easy to understand. His demonstrations were professional and each stage of the remodeling project was exactly as described. His performance to meet that end was evident in the working relationship that he had with his subcontractors. All the subcontractors that were working with SOD builders Construction in our remodeling, were outstanding, professional and open-minded for every step of the way. We easily came to trust on the SOD builders’ capabilities. Any question or concern that surfaced, Oren was able to take care of it immediately. If a change was required, we reviewed the amendment before signing the updated proposal. All these acts took place prior to starting any part of work. Oren was a huge asset to us. He was compassionate about our condition. He was always on time, showed up when he said he would. He called when he said he would. Oren was working hand by hand with all the subcontractors. And seriously involved with each day’s work and he always was on top of the daily construction needs or necessities. Oren was the kind of person who was welcomed into our home. He was forward-looking at all times. He was creative, trustworthy, very qualified and true to his word. Once we started working with him, we knew that we had hired the right company/person. He did everything he said he was going to do. He didn’t cut any corner. We would trust SOD builders with any project and without reservation, recommend the company to anyone."
5,"I was very pleased with the work and service that was provided by Oren. Oren and his team of workers remodeled my master bedroom by replacing the carper, installing a custom fireplace, paint the room, and remodel the master bathroom by replacing all the tiles, vanity, fixtures and plumbing. Oren is very attentive to details and perfection. He did a great job by supervising his people on a daily basis. His total price was very competitive compared to other contractors and mainly there was no hidden charges at the end of the remodeling and his quality of work was exactly what I expected to get for my money! I will recommend him to family and friends as I have been getting a lot of compliments for the work he did. Before Oren start to work at my house, he brought many samples of materials such as tiles and paint and lots of pictures which made the process flow and very easily. Also, his staff were very consistent by making sure that all my needs have been met. He will be my first choice when I will decide to remodel my kitchen as my next project. Thank you Oren and SOD builders!!"
5,"Our kitchen was a bit too small and uncomfortable because of a separating wall that was between the kitchen to the dining area, so we wanted to make it bigger and lighter and mostly to have the feeling of open space that will enlarge the space since we have the long windows and sliding doors by the dining area.  This remodeling was set in my mind for a while so I needed to put it in action.  I was just afraid it wouldn't be what I have in mind but SOD builders remodeled it the way I really wanted and expected to have. The moment Oren took down the separation wall at the kitchen, the space become so much bigger with so much light. I also wanted to replace the tile with wood floor and on the walls to have a nice tiles as back splash. Oren was able to get a great deal for all the materials and the big light creamy color ceramic tile on the floor with a really nice design with some stainless steel appliances and light grey pieces on the walls. Everything was going to look way too nice comparing to the cabinets so new dark brown wood cabinets were done too. I love my kitchen now and will use them in near future for sure."
5,"When we hired Oren from SOD builders, we liked that we dealt directly with the owners and no unprofessional salesman who work for commission and keep trying to push in order to sign the contract now and add as many items as he could knowing that we don’t know much about construction. After we met with Oren and his supervisor at our house, their attitude and their interest to know what we would like to have and how we imagine our new kitchen to look like etc.… we felt very comfortable and we scheduled the second meeting so we can see the design of the new kitchen and what Oren included in the new kitchen in regards to storage space and appliances. I must admit that this guys (Oren and his supervisor David) are definitely professional people and they have a great level of understanding and listening!!! The new design included all the features that we wanted to have and the total price was near the budget that we set at the first meeting. They total price for kitchen remodeling was about 10%- 18% less than all other 3 contractors that came to our house in order to do the same kitchen that we did with SOD builders. The job was done in a record time, so clean, so smooth exactly as promised."
5,"I fully recommend SOD builders! Oren and his team completed two remodels for our home in Tehachapi. The first remodel included two custom bathrooms in 2014. The bathrooms were designed by Michelle (The designer in SOD builders); Michelle works on many projects with Oren. Michelle highly recommended Oren for top-notch quality. We found Oren's team to be extremely knowledgeable, professional, and trust-worthy. Although the project took a bit longer than anticipated, it was well worth the wait, as the results are impeccable! We worked with Michelle and Oren again in for this remodeling on a much larger remodeling which included gutting and totally renovating the kitchen, living room, and dining room, as well as new flooring and interior doors throughout the remainder of the house. Shawn, Oren's cabinet maker, custom-designed the quarter-sawn Oak cabinets - amazing attention to detail! Shawn, as well as all of Oren's team, are excellent craftsmen. Oren, the supervisor of our remodel, suggested we vault the living room ceilings --this was not in the original plans, however, these ceilings transformed the room without adding square footage. 
Oren's work is top-notch; you get what you pay for. Do it right the first time. We really love our new home, and we would highly recommend SOD builders and his team!"
5,"I wanted to take the time and to express my experience and appreciation of the work that was done with SOD builders. Few months ago, we decided that it was finally the time to remodel all the bathrooms at the house (3 in total). We search and looked either online or by asking our friends and family in case they know a company that is worth to hire. After several recommendations and good search results, we came across SOD builders and we were impressed by their online site and past projects. From what we saw and heard, we decided to call them and to get more information about what we want to do and to hopefully schedule a face to face meeting and to take it from there. To our house arrived Oren and he checked and saw what we would like to achieve and to get from the bathrooms and what is the budget that we can afford. The first meeting was very good and few days later, we got the estimate for the work and Oren asked to meet with us again in order to go over it and see what can be changed. Oren understood exactly what we wanted and he made us feel like I was in very good hands. He was firm, capable and skilled. We really love my new bathrooms and we hope to work with SOD builders in the future."
1,"They took our $1,000 deposit and never worked on our deck or kitchen.  They were going to build our deck then remodel our kitchen for $80k.  It didn't happen.  They were to work on our deck prior to out kitchen.      It took over 1 month for them to respond to us at all after giving them our deposit check for $1k.    We kept waiting and waiting for a response, but we never received anything from Adam (our project manager).
Adam came to our house, he was a great sales person.  He convinced us that a SOD Builder is a fantastic company.  My wife had a great rapport with Adam during the initial interview/quote.  She mentioned I would travel to his home country (Hungry) for work.   He was excited and asked me questions where I went and how I liked it.  He seemed very personal and trust worthy, and I was sold.
I cut them a check for $1k on April 1,2016 for a deposit.  It was cashed on April 15th, 2016.  
Adam promised they would start immediately and he would personally be in charge of the project and be able to start the week of April 11th.  We were so exited getting a new deck and remolded kitchen.   They signed us up for Buildetrend.com.  This was a way for us to see the progress of our remodel.  I thought we were in the right hands.
We sent all the prints for the deck and permits to Adam.  The prints for the kitchen and permit were in progress.
We scheduled a time Monday April 11th, for the foeman to come get an assessment on the Demo of our deck., since Adam was the project manager, we thought Adam was going to be there too.  But to our surprise, only Damien (subcontractor) and another 2 workers were there. 
Damien asked for the drawings that we gave to Adam.  I was shocked, why didn’t Adam (Project Manager) give Damien (Sub Contractor) plans for our deck?  Our architect gave the official prints to Adam?  I don’t have a copy.  I ran scrambling thru emails looking for some type of schematic.  I finally found it after 20 mins of looking.  our Architect came by 10 mins after.  Our Architect was also expecting the Sub-Contractor to have the blue prints.  This was totally unprofessional.  There was no communication between Adam and the Sub-Contractor. 
After Damien left, we were told by SOD via Karla,  that Adam would “oversee” the project from the office.  He will never be on Site, only for emergencies.  The interview was the last time I talked to Adam or receive and email from our “Project Manager”.  This was not conveyed to us as the owners.  I wish he would have mentioned it during the quoting process.  We didn’t even get Damien’s email address.
Back to the story.  Now Damien has the plans, no work for the rest of the week. We try to contact Adam, to get pricing on the wood.  No contact from Adam from Tuesday Apriil 12- Friday April 15.  
Monday April 18th rolls around, no work has been done on the Deck, no contact from Adam for pricing.    We try to contact Adam or anyone from SOD, but nothing.  No Contact from Adam from Monday April 18th – Friday April 22. 

Monday  April 25 rolls around this is the 3rd week, NOTHING  has been done to the Deck.  NO contact at again from Adam or SOD.  Monday April 25 – Tuesday April 26th.

Tuesday night, April 26th I’m so frustrated, I email again,  thru builder trend and finally Angie’s list.  Pleading to get some answers from Adam.  All I want is our deck to be started.  
On Wednesday morning of April 27, 2016, I finally get a response from SOD, but they say   “I know that Karla and Adam are working on getting the pricing for you. They are just trying to collect all the information they need in order to give you an accurate price.”  Why didn’t they call us at all for those 3 weeks?  NO contact, ignoring our emails.
Later in the day, Oren Dagan contacts us via Buildertrend.com.  He says he wants to start the project next week, but he wanted to know:
•Do you want us to start working on the kitchen at the same time.
•Do you have the permit ready for the kitchen?Is your architect going to do that?
•Do you have the engineering (if needed) drawing for the wall removal?
•Are you ok with us starting the deck already, before the kitchen or do you want it all in once?
•Can you provide me with few days that i can send the carpenter over?
•Have you chosen your appliances, fixtures, hardware and etc for the kitchen? do you need any help or list of items needed?

WTF!! We talked to Adam about this way in the beginning during the quote.  He took lots of notes. He even itemized all these items on the agreement that we signed.   It’s like we are starting all over again! All they wanted was their deposit from us. 

We were totally frustrated."
5,"Oren from SOD builders was our lead contractor for our complete home renovation. After the initial design that we got from the architect and speedy construction, Oren did a great job by helped us with design of floorings, bathrooms, light fixtures, countertops, marble and tile work. We know that it’s hard and rare to find a contractor that have the qualities and abilities that required to create the perfect project but also patient, supportive and highly determined to get the remodeling project done. Oren, the on-site contractor and supervisor, did an outstanding work. The rooms came out beautiful with open space, light and clearly creative while at the same token, fits to our style which is warm and personal. Because this was the first time we did a home remodeling, it was a big deal to us that Oren will be able to absorb our vision for our house in terms of its style, realism, beauty and potential. SOD builders was equal to the task! We basically love the new kitchen that Oren designed and implemented at the house, the high ceiling in the media room, the marble master suite, the light engineered wood flooring, the amazing molding and the guest bathroom. We know that many contractors or construction companies could built our house, but what SOD builders can offer is a passion for your home and a promise that they are equal to the task of fulfilling its promise in the absolute standard of honesty and integrity to which they clearly hold themselves."
5,"I hired SOD builders to bring the backyard finally to life. My house is a new construction house and the lot was mainly dirt. This project was a challenging one because of the uneven space and I wanted to extend it by removing part of the hill side of the back yard.
 After spoking with an office personal from SOD builders, for the initial meeting that I had with them, I met with Oren. Oren was able to provide me with 2 designs including an estimate for each one of them in order to help me get few ideas of what I can do and mainly the cost of the extended lot. 
My main goal was to had an outdoor kitchen that will include:
-BBQ area with nice seating table and chairs.
-Rounded fire pit that will be surrounded by a stone bench with pillows.
-Grass area.
-Outdoor patio that will be inside/outside seating. This was my main goal in this remodeling and the most important task.
My main concern was that during the past, I did some remodeling work and my experience with them was not good at all. In one of the cases, the contractor just left the site in the middle and never came back to finish the work. Luckily enough, this was not the case with SOD builders. Oren was particularly educated about this type of projects and he provided great recommendations. Sure enough, there were some problems and issues, but Oren solved them when they arrived and without involving us too much with the solutions. This could only happened when you have all this extensive experience with what you do and love to do. I was mainly fascinated with the hard working and ethic of the actual workers. I can state that they always came to work at the house on time, they were polite and made sure not to leave a mess after each working day. SOD builders did such an excellent job and each time I hear a good word from someone that visit my house, I feel much happier about SOD builders and MAINLY Oren."
5,"We used SOD builders, Inc. for our kitchen remodeling project. This remodeling included all the new and custom (upper and lower) cabinets with an island in the center of the kitchen that added so much beauty and functionality to the super strange kitchen layout. The quality of the wood cabinets is really great and high. Great thick wood, anti-slam doors, changeable shelves, modified doors, and even custom handles. Oren from SOD builders, Inc. installed all the counter tops that matched perfectly with the wood. The island that we did, was furnished with the under sink and wine cooler. The efficient recessed lights and the low voltage lights in the upper cabinets added so much functionality features to the kitchen which was excellent. The engineered wood flooring was installed by Oren’s workers in the kitchen after Oren helped me personally to get a great discount on from his vendor. And Last thing was the back-splash who also was installed beautifully. Oren is a remarkable contractor in the Los Angeles area. He provide outstanding customer service and deliver a great construction. He also have a very professional and great staff.  When I contacted Oren for the first time, I felt I was in good hands. He had an incredible attitude, and he arrived ready to the appointment. The remodeling project was managed in a fast pace and everything was remodeled with real knowledgeable specialists. Looking how the working crew was working on the kitchen was pretty substantial. They were very accurate, detailed and cared about quality. I was surprised to see the crew cleaning the site after finishing their daily work. At the end, we had a very good experience with Oren from SOD builders, Inc. and we are very pleased with the great work and final price. I highly recommend SOD builders, Inc. construction."
5,"Oren and his team from SOD builders were fantastic people to work and deal with for the remodeling project that they did at my house. They remodeled my kitchen, 2 bathrooms and the 2 bedrooms. In the kitchen we remodeled the whole kitchen by replacing the cabinets, counter top, back splash, lightings, sinks, appliances and all the hardware. Oren and the designer were able to design the kitchen completely on a set of 3D designs and they were able to do it as close as possible to the real thing. This design was a great feature that allow us to see how it will look in reality. The bathrooms were also designed and planned by Oren and his office. The bathrooms were demolished completely and Oren redesigned it completely by replacing the shower (in one of them) and the bath tub and shower in the other one. On top of that, He installed all the vanities, faucets, lights, outlets and floor. The bedrooms were the easy ones because all we did was the new paint, crown molding, closet and carpet. Oren made sure that the rooms will be ready first so we can live in the house while the other spaces are being remodeled. We noticed that Oren has a great attention for aesthetics, functionality and beauty, He always keeps the resale value of the house in mind just and he kept mentioning that to us in case we will thing to sell the house in the future. His communications skills added a great amount of trust and happiness and even the suggestions that he gave us in regards to the whole remodeling were a good plus. They were very patient with us during the selection process of all the materials, and even coming back multiple times when our little ones prevented us from being as efficient as we hoped. We've heard so many bad stories of contractors that either left in the middle or did a bad job that caused to redo all the work again. This was certainly not the case with SOD builders and the people there, they were efficient and even surprises happened, they did the work without any additional fees. The only increase that we had was when we decided to increase the work around the fireplace in the living room. We will recommend SOD builders to our friends and family, and we will show their work s referrals. We usually don’t give reviews, but they were worthy."
5,"I recently had the powder room at my house completed remodeled by Oren and his workers from SOD builders. The old powder room had so many issues and it was not functional enough to our needs. It was originally done by the original builder so Oren and his team had a few challenges on their hands due to the bad existing layout. Oren was able to address all the issues with the powder room by maximize the space and installing as many cabinets as he could and I am extremely pleased with the end results. His team of workers installed new drywall, fully sanded and painted the walls and ceiling with color combination that was recommended to me by Oren at one of our meetings before I hired them, they also fixed the plumbing and replaced some of the pipes, did a complete electrical work by adding several outlets and switches and installed the vanity, toilet, and tile flooring. Oren made sure to provide me each daily with any update on the project and he made sure I was happy with every detail and stage of the powder room. He was extremely patient and understood exactly what I wanted.  I am very particular about my home and I stressed to Oren how important it was for me to have every perfect. Oren understood and reassured me that he would make sure I was happy with the results. Oren and his team exceeded my expectations which is pretty hard to do. I recommend SOD builders for anyone looking for a quality contractor to remodel their home.  I will definitely be using SOD builders for future projects in my home."
5,"Hiring SOD builders and working with Oren was a great and smart decision to do. 
We recently did our huge kitchen transformation. The job included the removal of few walls, ceilings popcorn being removed, new plumbing, new lighting and outlets with some smart home features etc...The interview process was very intense and massive. We feel we interviewed a fairly amount of contractors (7)! We talked and met a variety of people/companies, from small to large. We called to each one and spoke to them over the phone and did a research about them making sure that they have valid license, insurance and bond. We talked to few secretaries that couldn’t say our names correctly even and made mistakes with the appointment schedules.  When we called Oren from SOD builders he (the owner) answered...huge and big advantage on the rest. Some of the contractors that visited our house for an estimate would either agree to all of our requests by saying, ""absolutely or of course"" yes we can knock down this wall and not worry about support.  And some of them kept telling me how they wanted to model our kitchen, not listening to our requests or ideas... Oren was a very straight to the point kind of guy and without any selling stories.  He told us we could knock down walls but be sure about any support beams that would have to stay or replaced.  The first day we talked through the design and all the financing options.  Since it was our first big project, we honestly didn’t have any idea about how much it could cost. The demolition was quick and clean. It took them only 2 days to complete this task. The working team were very nice to us and we got to know a lot about them. They made sure to use plastic covers every day and sweep up at the end of every day and made sure our house was livable. We ran into some of the beam support issues we mentioned above.  Oren came up with a great solution that caused us to redesign the kitchen look. Oren came up with a suitable layout that worked for us.  This actually changed the focal point of the kitchen and we loved the new look with this change. The project took a bit longer than we thought it would but was within the time frame that Oren promised us.  We could've had it done in less time but we wanted to take our time and to make sure that we are comfortable.  The final kitchen is really stunning. We can see that there was a lot love, care, special touch and craftsmanship into the smallest finishing details. Oren was on site almost every day.  If it wasn't him, then his foreman was.  He was equally as professional and committed as Oren was.  Oren saw every step all the way through and ensured no detail was over looked.  There was even a few details we asked for at the beginning of the project that we failed to remind him of that made its way into the final product.  We were really happy to see this. There were several of small problems and things that needed to be addressed after the project ended, but Oren was there.  He popped in to make sure all was still good.  He does this because the house needs a chance to settle in a bit.  He addressed them no problem. OVERALL EXCEPTIONAL JOB by Oren and his team at SOD builders.  We will definitely be working with him again!!!"
5,"We recently hired SOD builders for a few projects at the house. The remodeling project was including: 
-Adding a balcony Door and window from the bedroom to the patio/backyard, 
-Full complete bathroom remodeling. 
-New fireplace and mantel installation. 
-Re-tiling the entryway and the kitchen with dining area.  
 Oren and the workers definitely won our business after meeting us at the house and worked around our budget and they delivered exactly the results that we were hoping to get from them. Oren was very professional and knowledgably throughout the whole time of the remodeling and any issue that we had with anything, Oren was able correct it. He was also extremely helpful by explaining us how things would look after we had trouble visualizing few things, like the pattern of the tile. What really put them over the top in our book was that 3 weeks after… the remodeling was done. Oren called up to follow up (after the work was completed) and ask if everything was still to our satisfaction. I have noticed a few small gaps in the grout on the flashing around the shower but it never really bothered me too much.  But since he called, I mentioned this to him, and he sent one of his guys over to take care of it. Oren's worker also installed a new water regulator in the shower after the water pressure was too high after using it for a month. We are pleased with everything and would recommend to friends and would use them on future projects.

I have attached before and after photos of the fireplace and bathroom jobs, the work speaks for itself."
5,"We found SOD builders, after being frustrated in the past from other contractors. From the initial meeting that we had with Oren, we were impressed. Their values of customer satisfaction and their deliver everything they said. Oren was the manager of the work and he was on time for all the meetings that we had with him. He was very straight, kindly and motivated to be invited into our house. He came back and took all the measurements that he needed for the kitchen, asked us many questions about what we would like to include in the new kitchen and 3 days after, he brought us a 3D design for us to look at and see how it will most likely look like. It was exciting to see how fast they could generate a nice design. Oren knew what he’s doing and we were sure he has done this type of jobs many times before. Their prices are reasonable. We wanted our kitchen finished as soon as possible, so we agreed with Oren to start the following week. That gave us little time to buy all the appliances, hardware, countertops, tiles Etc… Oren personally went with us to 2 showrooms where we picked out our tiles and countertops. He also helped us to search and buy all the options for the (sink, faucet, hardware and more…). To be honest, I was probably a nightmare type of work. We moved out of our place during the month of the remodeling and we were a little worried that something would go wrong and we would end up on a terrifying remodeling show. Now after this remodeling is over, we can say clearly that is nothing to worry about when SOD builders are working at your house. Their workers was clean, friendly, willing to answer questions. I discovered that Oren visits the job site every few days, but he too sincerely cares about your home. He always called regarding the schedule, timeline or if there was a problem that need to be solved. We asked for changes to the electric wiring after the tiles have been installed. Would I recommend them to others? Absolutely yes. We will refer this company to all our friends."
5,"We would like to express our excellent experience with the remodeling of our house that was done by SOD builders and managed by Oren. Our recently completed full home remodeling that included:
-Master bedroom
-Master bathroom
-Hallway 
-Guest room remodeling
-Laundry room
The remodeling came out great and we are honestly enjoying each part of it due to the success of it. When we initially met with Oren in the beginning of this year, we discussed the first project which was to remodel the kitchen, laundry room and entry of the house. Prior to meeting with Oren, we met with several other contractors. Some were big companies that sent to us a salesman that tried to keep adding things and things that we didn’t need in order to make the estimate much bigger and with tons of promises that most likely can’t be fulfilled. What we knew from the past was, that in order to have the closest estimate as possible, we will need to have our own architect that will provide us with a fully detailed design of the work that we want to do and by that, we will know exactly what we need. Oren with his own expertise was able to see it and understand the design very easily and this was a real bonus and we could tell from our first meeting that he definitely brought much more to the table than the other contractors. What we didn’t know before Oren completed the remodeling, was how great his work will be and how efficient as well. We feel pretty much fortunate, as most of the time you hear horrible stories from people about construction. Oren and his team always kept us up to date and there was hardly a day when someone wasn’t at the house working. The team was trustworthy and competent, and we could always reach Oren and his staff at the office when we needed. For these reasons, we were very comfortable putting our second project in his hands. We would not hesitate to recommend Oren for any remodel or construction project. We thank him for making our home beautiful."
5,"From the first day I called SOD builders and met with Oren, I was impressed with their customer service very much and how they know to follow up everything. After talking to Oren over the phone and explaining to him my goals and what I would like to do, I knew instantly that this would be the company that I will hire to remodel my kitchen. Oren and Jacob, the owners are extremely knowledgeable And he know how to manage and handle every aspect of the remodeling, visit the house on a daily basis and perform regular checks about the progress of the remodeling and clearly not only takes pride in each and every work, but is knowledgeable and definitely involved in each step of the process. He, and his office manager Yael, and his interior designer, Rachael, guided me in all my decisions and made sure I stayed on budget and still get the most out of the needs in this remodeling without compromising any of the design elements I wanted and needed. The crew that were working under the supervision of Oren were hard workers and knew exactly what they need to do and they did it on the best side making sure that everything is in perfect finish. They were professionals and very polite. I have never dealt with workers like this before and I was extremely suppressed with them. In the bottom line, the new kitchen is beyond my expectations. We finished the remodeling of the new kitchen ahead of schedule and a little bit above budget (for some additions that we wanted to have and were not included in the initial estimate."
5,"At first, we wanted to remodel the kitchen at our house by our self, but we figured out that it will be so hard and complicated for us to even manage this type of a project so the best option was to hire a contractor instead and let him do it. This idea a great idea but the only challenge we had was that we wanted the kitchen to be done as soon as possible. We did our research through several online sites in order to find the “right contractor”. We were honestly impressed by the all the photos that we saw about SOD builders past projects and we decided to give them a call and to meet with them in order to determine if they are the right for us. In total, we interviewed 6 contractors (so frustrating and time consuming) and we looked over all the estimates that we got in order to compare them apple to apple and to scope the project. SOD builders estimate stood out because they were the one that reached out to us when we had all the hard and easy questions about the estimate. The kitchen space was the biggest issue because it supposed to be the main focal point in the house and the main space in our requirement in the remodeling. Oren had so many great ideas! He suggested us to tear down the wall that separating the living room from the kitchen. We loved this idea because it will give our home a big open space feeling AND connecting all rooms. At the end of the work, we were blown away by the new transformation. Oren listened to our ideas and he was able to incorporate all of them into the new design of the kitchen. All the work was done and completed on the time that we agreed before we signed the agreement with Oren. We couldn’t be happier with the way everything turned out. There is more work to be done in our home but we are holding off until things get more settled. SOD builder’s construction will be the first place we contact once we decide to move forward."
5,"I hired SOD builders for a 650 sq/ft. of living room addition. Before we hired them, we already had all the necessary plans on hand including all the secured building permits with the city. When it comes to workmanship and speed, I must admit that landmark construction was very fast while investing extra attention to perfection. All the teams of workers worked fast even when it came to fixes and adjustments. They replaced the wood floor with new engineered wood flooring, repainted the entire ceiling and one living room wall and blended new stucco on the exterior wall. The new addition required new foundation, framing, and window installation. We are thoroughly content with all the work that was completed by SOD builders. 
1)they made sure to cover everything all around the working area in order to prevent damages and extra work due to paint spots and dust from all the sanding. 
2)They came to work on a daily basis and few times they skipped work BUT they made sure to confirm that 2 days ahead. This was very responsible from them to do.
3)Oren the Project Manager was available and reached all the time. When he couldn’t talk or answered, he called within the hour.
In regards to pricing… the price that we got from SOD builders was in the middle range. Oren came over to the house several times to discuss about the details and the process of the project, and after that he start working on the estimate."
5,"I found this fantastic construction company almost by an accident, literary driving close by, and never regretted it. Few months ago I needed to renovate my kitchen and to make a very quick decisions on whom to hire to help with the design and with the actual construction. The personal at the company were very friendly and I was very lucky to find that my advisor, Oren, was available to take my kitchen remodeling project right away. We met a few times at my house, Oren explained me all details of all variations of the cabinets the company is working with, and I made my choice very quickly. The counter top was installed by another company that specialized in counter tops and Oren arranged a few meetings with the company without any delays and to my full satisfaction. The design part took very swift period and after few changes was approved and sent to production. The cabinets came directly from the factory on time and in good order and condition. Oren worked with workers, explaining them the details of the design and how it will need to look. We have chosen a contemporary cabinets for the new kitchen with several twists and new materials. By the end of the remodeling, the installation was very easy and painless, and I am very happy with the result.  I love the new kitchen and I would highly recommend Oren and SOD builders to anyone who needs high quality kitchen."
5,"I contacted SOD builders and spoke to Oren about what I would like to do at my house and what is my style and goals. Oren came over to my house on the day and time that we scheduled over the phone and he inspect the 2 bathrooms and kitchen. For a while we had major mold problems in the bathrooms and we start to have our concerns about it which caused us to do this remodeling ASAP. For this remodeling project, we spoke to few other contactors and we received few bids as well, but we still decided to go with SOD builders even though there was not big of a difference in the price, I was impressed with the way SOD builders and mainly with Oren. What caused that was the great communication that we had with him and his way of thinking and ideas. A week after the meeting and after we saw in details the design and estimate that Oren did for us, we signed the initial contract and we gave our approval to complete remodel the bathrooms and kitchen with Oren and his team and we set a date to start the work. The problem with mold that we had in the bathrooms, Oren brought his people to do the demolishing first and after that, they moved forward and start the construction. We were more than happy with the final results of the remodeling and we would recommend SOD builders to anybody we know. For us the total cost was the main issue that we have and after that was the communication. SOD builders was the only company that was able to work with us about the price and during the work, He made sure to stay in touch each few days with us throughout the remodel. Once again, Oren, Leslie and the actual people that did the remodeling were all outstanding. Everybody that worked on our home was friendly, very knowledgeable, and took great care in the work they did."
5,"I was referred to SOD builders by a neighbor who had a driveway installed. I had an old concrete backyard and old bricks on the front of my house. I met with Oren after I spoke and got the basic information from the office staff about how they work. 
Oren was able to present me so many available options for my backyard, front walkway, drains and chimney. His estimate included various options I could choose from and he was very fair. Oren was able to meet with me at one of his suppliers in Ventura and he helped me to select the pavers for the house. He was able to share his experience with the different types of products. 
Oren made sure to keep in touch by either calling or texting every day during the project and introduced me to Jacob who was the foreman. Both of them were extremely valuable as anytime there was a decision in cutting a paver, or locating a drain they provided their experience to make the best decision for my specific job. The crew worked hard all day, and cleaned up the debris on a regular basis. 
I am very happy with the job they did at the back of my house and in the front. The new look of the house is completely different now. I am considering another project on the side of my house, and there is no hesitation at all about who will I hire for that job. I will definitely hire SOD builders. I highly recommend them."
5,"We recently hired SOD builders and their crew of workers to design and remodel my new master bedroom that included the master bathroom as well for our house. Prior to the remodeling, I researched and met with three other contractors and designers and asked them for an estimate and referrals for that job and after meeting with all of them, I knew that Oren from SOD builders was the right contractor for me. Oren was extremely creative, honest and open minded person that cares a lot about the project from the begging of the work till the end. Before the work started and during the process of finding the right one, I was concerning is I do the right decision and what will happened if… to start this work, but after the work started and Oren start to appear at my house and supervised the actual work, all my fears and concerns vanish and it was a really smooth process. Oren and his team communicated with me before, during and after each stage of the work to make sure everything went smoothly and without any mistakes and more than that, he went above and beyond a lot of things that weren’t included to make sure that I get exactly what I wanted. Oren even went with me to select, buy and pick up all of the items that I needed for the project including the floors, paint, crown moldings, fixtures, stones for the vanities, doors etc.  He even helped me to make the final look as I always wanted. Things happened when he said they would happen and there weren't any big surprises or hiccups along the way. They completed the project on time AND MAINLY on the budget which was the biggest factor and fear in this whole work."
5,"I am so happy I choose SOD builders for my bathroom remodeling project at my house. During the years, I heard so many people's nightmare with contractors that caused me to do a triple search for a good company that can come and do the work without any hidden charges, and mainly to be able to complete the work. I was pretty nervous about the remodeling. After 5 estimates and meetings with contractors, I decided to go with SOD builders after my research about them showed me that they are a good company and that they are in business for a long time already. Oren was the project manager, He was very helpful, super nice and professional. I am kind of a picky person, and he was very patient with me. He came to my house or call me every day and check to make sure I am happy with every step on the way. Oren and his team worked six days a week, came on time, clean up every day. When they left, they made sure to keep the rest of the house as clean as possible. Now after my bathroom remodeling is completed, I have a beautiful new bathroom to enjoy. I am very happy with it! I absolutely recommend SOD builders. Remember to ask for Oren, you will not be disappointed."
5,"I just completed my full home remodeling that included the kitchen 3 bathrooms, Dining room and 2 bedrooms. SOD builders was the best construction company that I've worked with. Oren and his team of professionals were good with communication (they returned all my phone calls and emails within the same day of the following day) and were responsive to all our request, questions, ideas, thoughts and changes mainly when they start to open walls. They are fully licensed, bonded and insured contractors and came up with the proper paperwork to prove it. The initial pricing was competitive and logic while the add-ons we had during the work were very well priced. The kitchen remodeling included basically everything from new floor and new cabinets to new paint and island in the middle. The bathrooms were also remodeled and they needed to have new shower, vanities, plumbing and paint as well, and the bedrooms needed new paint and carpet with cabinets for the closets. 
The working crew and some in home vendors were on-time and at full size throughout the remodel. Jacob, the foreman, was great person to work and deal with. He came up with some great suggestions and ideas for changes that really improved the final work and few of them even made the work a bit cheaper and saved us money. The quality of the whole remodeling was more than excellent. It was completed on-time (2 months from start to finish) and on-budget – which was the main important thing in this whole work. The final items were addressed in a timely manner to our complete satisfaction. We've already recommended him to a friend and would highly recommend this company to anyone doing home remodeling. It was a pleasure working with them and when we finally decide how we want the living room lighting I'll have them back to do the work!"

5,"When I and my partner moved into the same house, we instantly realized that we will have to make several improvements in order to fit the house for both of us. The first thing that we had was the tiny sink in the master bathroom and the shower. This master bathroom was the first thing that we needed to do.  In addition to that there was not enough space for the both of us. We also had some plans in mind for this bathroom bedroom closet in order to make it as a walk-in closets. Once we agreed to a master bathroom and closet remodeling, we met with Oren from SOD builders and when he came over, he looked and took it from there. As part of our meeting with Oren. We brought up the idea about remodeling the kitchen, bedroom and to do the hardscape in the back and front of the house. By adding all of this as a one big deal, Oren and his workers were able to do much better work than what we thought to get. The bedroom is the master bedroom at the house and Oren redesigned it and gave it a completely new look and feel.  In the hardscape part of the house, Michelle (the designer of the company) came up with a brilliant concept of how it can be and the sketch of her design caught our attention immediately. Her design included all the new plants, trees, Stamp concrete and outdoor small kitchen with BBQ that included a bar, seating area and a fire pit. 
In the front of the house, she was able to design new entry to the house and several steps with nice rocks and tropical trees. The deal that we got from Oren, was very good and we took it. We were able to live at the house while they worked there and it was not as bad as we thought it will be. Oren made sure to concentrate at the house first and to do all the dirty work in all the spaces and then to do all the outdoor items. The work was completed after 3 months of work and without any major problem. The office communicated with us during the whole project and it made it easy and comfortable. If you're nervous about hiring a contractor, don't be! You just need to follow our advice and feel free to contact SOD builders."
5,"The work that we needed to do was kind of big. We had to interview several companies prior to execute the work. When we met Avi from SOD builders, we were kind of worried about what will he say or recommend us to do. Our thoughts were not good! Avi was pretty experienced with this type of projects. He was able to show us several projects that he did in the past and we were able to confirm them. The work that took more than 3 months, was pretty intense.  There were people each day working on the house. The roof people, the kitchen workers, and the windows. During all the time of the work, we met with Avi several times when we had to see and check all the plans prior to have them done. Avi was able to explain to us everything about the work. There was not a day that the workers missed to come over. The whole project went without any problem. All permits were taken care of by Avi and all we took care of were the payments. The price that we got from them was a little bit less than all the other estimates that we got."
5,"We remodeled our medium size kitchen (approximately 15 ft by 20 ft) that included new paint, new floor, lighting fixtures, Counter top and sink. The work was performed by Avi and his 4 workers. Avi worked hand by hand with them and made sure that our kitchen will be completed as we wanted. The work was divided by several sections. The first section was the demolition in which the workers removed the old kitchen including the drywalls and after that, was the installation of all the new lightings and cabinets. We were happy with the fact that Avi ordered all the materials for the kitchen and we only had to select the colors and types from the big selection of samples that Avi present us. The new kitchen was completed after 4 weeks when originally Avi promised us that it will be longer than that. His workers came to work each day and worked till late hours. We will recommend Avi to our friends and we are very happy with the new kitchen that he built for us."
5,"Avi from SOD builders was fantastic from start to finish of my remodeling project. He met me at the property several times to get a more detailed proposal together. He was informative, good communicator and honest. You know those types of contractors that just end up doing the bare minimum and still end up taking twice the amount of time they ""estimated?"" Avi doesn't that way. I unfortunately didn't choose him for our investment property but wish I had. The contractor I ended up choosing came from a personal reference and we had a good rapport but ended up doing exactly what I said above. Taking twice as long (a little bit of extra, unexpected work, and bad time management and perhaps scattered with a little lazy), and going over budget. Avi on the other hand I believe, from his detailed analysis of every little thing gave me the confidence that he would've finished near to the estimated completion time and would have done so responsibly and with enough detail that I wouldn't feel compelled to go back and go through every little thing to ensure I got my money's worth. During the whole remodeling at the house that included new floor, paint, lighting fixtures, closets and carpet Avi was there to make sure that everything is good and going according to the plan. Avi made sure also that the workers will cover all the things that they won’t replace so they will be protected while they were working."
5,"This is the second time that we use this company for a project at our house. A while back we used them in our previous house and we liked the way they worked, their price and the end results of the work that they did. This time was not difference. Out initial meeting was with Oren. He came to our house on the day and time that we scheduled ahead of time. When he came over, he looked at the bathroom and came up with some nice recommendations and ideas that can still fit in our budget and be nice. The bathroom includes: paint, vanity, Floor and shower. The massive work took over 2 weeks. Each day, Oren made sure to come over with his team of workers (3-4 each day) and to guide them on how things need to be done and what has been done since the last time he visited our house. The total amount was very fair and we didn't have any changes or hidden charges at all."
5,"SOD builders did a room addition to our house, it was clear that additions are their specialty. This is our first time remodeling so we were new to the process, Daniel, our project manager took a special care of everything that was involved in this addition from revising the plans, helping in choosing the final materials, purchasing them and making sure that they will arrive to the house on time so all the workers will keep working without stopping due to missing materials. The whole work went smoothly and without any problem. We are honestly and fully satisfied with the end results and we are so happy that we hired them. The workers arrived to the house always on time and didn’t miss any day during the work, they were honest and open to any idea that we had and answered to all of our questions when we had them. We knew we wanted to add another bedroom to our house but were not really sure about the specifics. Daniel shared his ideas while working with ours, Daniel and the workers truly know how to work with their customers which made this whole experience so much easier. In the past, we heard horrible stories in the past about companies surprising customers with hidden fees which results in paying more for the project than originally planned. The price we agreed on was the same from beginning to end. If you are looking for a trustworthy and dedicated company then we recommend SOD builders 100%"
5,"We highly recommend SOD Builders!  Extremely professional, competent and hard working.  Oren was extremely patient with us as we tried to work out how to get the kitchen of our dreams within our budget.  He genuinely wanted us to be 100% happy with the design before we committed.  The price Oren gave us was very competitive and included an interior designer, Carmit Oron, who pulled a beautiful, functional design together that is perfect for our busy family.  Oren made everything so stress free for us, he took care of all the details of the building permit and project management.
The workers turned up at our house on the set date and from then on we had workers in the house most days.  If they couldn’t make a day in the week they asked if it would be okay to come at the weekend.  They were reliable, polite, friendly and very tidy, putting up plastic screens to protect the house from dust and sweeping at the end of the day. We were connected to the whole team with the BuilderTrend App, this was invaluable as my husband and I both work and it allowed them to communicate with us and send photos of the progress.  Oren checked in with us regularly and and answered emails 24/7, always with his goal of us being happy, nothing was ever too big a problem.
We are so happy with our kitchen and I will be calling SOD to do our next projects.  Truly a first class construction company with exceptional customer service!  Calling SOD was the best decision I made!  I love my kitchen!"
5,"I contacted SOD builders to see what it will require to remodel my kitchen. At first I spoke to Michelle who was very nice and polite to me over the phone and she asked me some basic question in order to understand what my goals are. After that phone conversation, she asked me if I would like to schedule a meeting with Oren. The meeting was scheduled for the following week and Oren arrived to my house on the time frame that Michelle gave me (she was kind enough to even call me an hour before to make sure that I’m home and to inform me that Oren was on the way). The meeting with Oren was very good. Oren was able to provide me with good samples of cabinets, Floor and paint colors combinations. His main goal on that meeting was to see the existing kitchen and to get some measurements of the space in order to maximize the space. At the end of the meeting, Oren and I scheduled another meeting in order to present to me a 3D design of how the new kitchen will look like and how much will it cost me (even though I mentioned my max budget at the first meeting). The second meeting was very good as well. Oren presented to me the kitchen design that showed me how the new kitchen will look like and I was very impressed. After finalizing all the estimate, materials, colors and the price, Oren went back to his office in order to generate a schedule work plan so I will know what and when my new kitchen will be ready. The work went pretty smooth and it went according to the schedule plan that Oren did. The workers were nice and polite as well and Oren visited the house almost every day to make sure that the work is going according to plan. A month and a half after, my kitchen was completed and it came out even better than the one that I saw in the design."
5,"Very good company and people to work with! Originally we were interesting in removing a wall in the dining room area that will show a bigger open space. We spoke to several companies and we came across SOD builders. We loved the fact that they are having multiple offices with lots of years of experience and that in our initial meeting, we were able to get all the answers for our questions and the ideas that could improve our house. Oren, is a great communicator person and he has a good amount of knowledge when it comes to remodeling and design. He met with us several times and he also was able to give us a price that was very comparable to the other ones we got. The work started with the removal of the wall and it continued from there to the kitchen and bathrooms. We rebuild the space for the bath tub prior to the new installation of it and floor. We couldn't have been more pleased! Oren did expert work, very cleaned and detailed. They worked up daily and they were so nice and pleasant people.  We are so thrilled with this bathroom.  We had no idea it would look so nice... I can't recommend this company enough. SOD builders is the one stop shop place... they provide everything that you will need for the job.  If you are looking to upgrade or remodel your bath or kitchen, go with them!"
5,"We hired SOD BUILDERS, as the first project we decided to NOT complete ourselves due to some difficulties that came up and it was too much for us. We’re typically DIY-er’s and we are pretty good at it (if we do say so). Our kitchen project was much larger in scope than we could tackle and a friend recently had SOD BUILDERS complete their kitchen. We didn’t shop around and we trusted on our friend recommendation and we also saw the finished kitchen that they did. Our initial meeting with Oren, just gave us all the information we needed in order to give the approval for this project. We were paired up with Oren, who visited our home, listened to our ideas and took them to the next level. His details and space planning expertise was good & complemented by Juan to help select finishes. This was also the first time I put my trust in others to select or at least to help us with finding finishes and materials. Their pricing for this project was reasonable and worthy, the project management and coordination was painless and the overall results are stunning."
5,"My husband and I purchased our home in last year that needed of lot of remodeling.  The house was in a very bad condition and it needed to be fully renovated. From our past experience, we knew how the process was going but we were fully committed to finding the right contractor for this and to get this renovation project going and complete. It pretty sad to see that no one in my family, friends or neighbors were able to refer someone they had used in the past because they had such a bad experience during or after the remodeling. We interviewed pretty much a lot of contractors but we must say that Eran from SOD builders was the most honest and pleasant contractor we've met from all the other ones. From the very beginning he told us what to expect and what we need to do before hiring ‘A’ contractor. He initially told us we need an architect to change the structure and layout of the house. We tried to differ from his advice but we realized he was right about hiring the architect. We needed an architect to legally change the structure and layout of our house. Eran invested time to gain our trust by presenting to us some of his previous jobs for reference. His estimate (SOD builders) was not extremely low which means his work was not low quality but it was not extremely high either. it was in the middle!  We believe his price was very fair and reasonable for all the amount of work we required. Now after the work is completes, I can write that I am very happy we decided to hire him for this project. 
From the moment Eran took over this project, his team has made this process a lot easier for us. they completed the demolition of our home in 4 days which was impressive! They began by leveling out the floors and created the new layout of our home right after. They were knowledgeable, well experienced and they followed all the steps and stages in the plans. Everything that was on paper was coming to life right before our eyes and it was an unforgettable experience. The footing & foundation are very solid, the framing, exterior finishing and the interior finishing were remarkable and used great materials. Overall, his team are highly skilled contractors and I will forever be grateful for their talent and exceptional customer service. His team was extremely professional, respectful, hardworking and reliable individuals. They were always united, always on time and always available to answer our questions. It was such a beautiful, pleasant experience that I will always speak very highly of SOD builders and I will never trust anyone else other than this team to do work in my house or any other project I may face in the near future."
5,"We had a great experience with Oren from SOD builders. Oren was able to do a good job at our house remodeling the master bathroom and bedroom of our kids with his bathroom too.
The bathroom in our kid’s room is jack and Jill that has a shower/tub with large vanity. The decision to work with Oren and his workers was taken after several meetings with him and his designer Michelle. Michelle was very creative with her ideas about what to do and Oren explained to us each step and stage of the remodeling. The materials were selected by Oren and he gave us several options after he learned what we would like to do and what type of styles we love. The work in the bathroom included the removal all the old tiles, bath tub and shower and install new ones with the design that we selected. The work came out very good and it brought a new life to the bathroom including the new shower handles, Paint, vanity with sink and faucet.
The master bedroom required more work due to the age of it. We wanted to have marble floor, and special tiles all over the walls, paint and some extra storage cabinets that will allow us to have extra space. Oren worked with his workers on this project on a daily basis and the remodeling came out very good. Oren was able to assign 2 teams of workers to our house and to make sure that the work will end according to schedule."
5,"Oren, from SOD builders, is great general contractor I have ever hired. A close friend recommended him and I couldn't be happier. Oren first did some smaller jobs, like replacing all our toilets with water-saving models. He also fixed a serious leakage problem that we didn't know about because it was caused by the flooring people not putting in the correct toilet seal. The musty smell that we couldn't find is now gone. He finished a bathroom remodel, tearing out the vinyl shower/tub and replacing it with a Jacuzzi whirlpool tub. The bathroom was quite large and now looks even larger, not to mention beautiful. He and his workers on the tub and tile installation that was complex and time-consuming. I was especially happy that he was able to adjust what I wanted to do to keep me within my budget by suggesting different tiling pattern choices. We went with his suggestions and it is so much better than what we were going to do. We would highly recommend Oren for repair work and remodels, though we hope he doesn't get too busy. We have started a new to-do list for him."
5,"This company (SOD Builders) proved to me how great they are! It’s hard to remodel a house especially when you don t know where to start from or what to begin with. I found SOD Builders on several places including a magazine and I called to their office and spoke to Sofia. Sofia scheduled an appointment with Oren and she also called me an hour before to confirm the appointment. Oren came over and after a 2 hours meeting, he was able to give me an estimate for the kitchen. He was so good of explaining the all the building and safety codes so I was pretty amazed with his knowledge .He didn't push me to sign anything like other companies did and he wanted to have another meeting with me in order to show me a design of the new kitchen. I liked that so, after the second appointment and looking at his new design of the kitchen, I decided to hire him. His team of demolition people, carpenters, framers etc... Was so knowledgeable and clean .This guys do know how to take care of customers and how to work clean and good. Oren was coming almost every day to check the work and go over the details with me again in order to make sure we don’t miss anything and that I’m happy with the current progress. The job turn out great .Oren made sure that I will not have to pay any other fee more over the contract. I would recommend him to all my friend. I am very HAPPY"
5,"Oren with SOD builders was the Manager that managed our remodeling project and his end results work and schedule was just perfect.  I know when usually you start a remodeling project of any kind, you figure the schedule to be very flexible and the remodeling project to always take weeks or months to finish beyond what the contractor says, but in my review here I would like to tell you that Oren and his crew of people finished on time.  All the workers worked every day and did not miss one day or late, and the work was without any doubt top notch.  I had, really, nothing to complain about.  Therefore Oren and SOD builders deserve this positive.  What I liked most in this remodeling was that Oren made sure that the workers will know exactly what do each day and that all the materials will be at the house waiting for them and not the other way around."
5,"I had two bathrooms completely remodeled with SOD builders (Oren). Oren did a great & quality work and delivered 100% on budget. I was concerned about any hidden problems or charges at first, since I had some concern there were few leaking pipes behind the wall that might have caused an issue. Oren and his guys did a thorough probe testing before starting and making their estimates. Everything ended up very well and I got two beautiful new bathrooms, even though it was one week behind schedule but completely on budget which was great thing after all! Our experiences with Oren (The supervisor) and the Designer on top of the tradesmen were 100% positive. They took our need to leave in the house a fully functioning bathroom at all time and made it happen (I must mentioned that several other companies told us clearly that it will be 'impossible' to have it when I got an estimate from them - that was also more reasons to what SOD builders gave us and lived up to). I am very pleased with our choice and the results."
5,"I have no complains about this company and the people that worked at my house. At my house, Oren sent 4 workers that came over and did all the paint work. They covered everything and made sure to move all the bulky items so they won’t get damaged. After they finished the work, they returned and arranged the items and then moved to the next area. Oren assigned to my house his supervisor Charlie and he visited the house several times during the work time and made sure that we are happy and that there are no problems. Most of the paint work was a sponge paint with 2 colors but the common areas were with a special paint which took longer to do. I'm very happy with this company and I highly recommend them for any paint work."
5,"SOD builders just finished a full remodeling of our house. It all started with our meeting with Oren and Michele by measuring and understanding what we want to do. Michele came over several times and presented to us her designs and Oren was the person that tried each time to improve the space and to maximize the quality of the materials. The remodeling started with the Kitchen and bathroom at the same stage of work, while the work in the kitchen in process, Oren and his workers started to work on the dining room & laundry room. The plumbing and main rain replacement repairs work was done by several of his people and they did a great job in that part too. The kitchen that we remodeled was with oak wood and included an island, counter tops, new outlets and appliances.
The hallways contained several closets and storage spaces that were designed and installed by Oren and his people. All exterior windows and texture coated the exterior of our house. We had never before taken on anything like this and Oren walked us through every step of the way from permitting to code to design explaining what needed to be done in realistic steps. The crew of workers showed up to the house on time every day and did a very professional job in all respects. Any difficulties were taken care of immediately by either Oren or Avi. Many great ideas came from these 2 and also from Michel. The proof that SOD builders are great company is at the end results, as now we have a beautiful home with all the modern touches and for much less than other bids that had much less work involved. Everything that Oren said he would do, he did. I would recommend SOD builders for any size job you have in mind, they stand by their word."
5,"SOD builders provided us with an amazing customer service throughout the process of the remodeling from start to end. Their prices were very competitive. It doesn't get much better than this. We were having foundation work done on my elderly mother's home in LA. We arranged this remotely via a friend that recommended us to Avi and Oren. Avi took time, care, and patience to make sure that the remodeling will be comfortable with the process and to answer each and every one of our questions. This alone makes us recommend them as highly as possible. Customer service of this level is very very rare today. The work that they did was managed by Oren. Oren brought his 3 men team and made sure they will do an amazing work and as fast as they could.  I would use this company again without any hesitation. I'd give 6 stars if I could."
5,"we LOVE LOVE LOVE SOD builders. this is the THIRD time we are using them over the last ten years, each for progressively bigger and bigger jobs. they are so kind and on top of stuff and just get it done. they have a manager assigned to the task so you have someone you can always call and they have someone for everything. just whatever you need. and they do it right. 
whether it was little finishing touches or knowing just how to redo our old hardwood floors, what sink to put in, how to fix our cabinets, fixing the deck outside, making our outdoor area a beautiful patio space we now love, making beautiful built ins for us, interior and exterior painting, fencing, electrical, refreshing our kitchen so that now it is just gorgeous, all of it, just done perfectly. 
literally, i cannot say enough good things. i would never ever use another contractor. working with SOD feel like you have an uncle in the business that you can just call when you need help. and you know will be taken care of like family. 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
5,"Great company and people to deal and work with! The main thing that I liked in this remodeling was the communication and the care that Oren showed me. He gave me the feeling that his is remodeling his own bathroom and he cared for every detail in the remodeling. The bathroom remodeling that I did, started with the selection of all the materials, color combinations and all the hardware that Oren will install in the bathroom. Oren planned everything pretty good and he made sure not to have any extra materials so the total amount will remain the same. At the end of the remodeling, the total price was the same as the original estimate and this meant a lot to me because I heard so many stories where the final price become higher due to extra items that the contractor add during the remodeling."
5,"We had the need to enlarge the bathroom and to add a bath tub. We spoke to several contractors and companies about this project and we met with few of them. When we spoke to SOD builders. The person that we spoke with was very nice and polite. She scheduled a meeting with Adam. Adam came over at the time frame that was scheduled ahead by the office and he was the person that was able to give us a good quote for that and we were able to speak to some of his past. After we approved the quote and gave our OK to start, Adam sent his workers to start work. The work started with the demolition of the existing bathroom and adding the new frames. Then, all the plumbing and drainage was completed with the lighting. When all of that was completed, they did all the drywall and paint including all the electricity. The floor was one of the last items that they did and it came out great. I want to mention that we enjoyed working with Adam and his team of workers. They are nice and professional people."
5,"We recently had a master bath and a guest bath remodel with SOD BUILDERS.
Their project manager Lance was very helpful in choosing the right materials and answered all our questions in every step!
The team was very friendly, respectful and cleaned every day the work was done...
Although some issues/extra fixes came up, they could finish project on time.
Best customer service from the office too.
Love our new baths!"
5,"This was my first remodel, and it was a large project for a small space. SOD was very professional from the beginning. I never felt nickel and dimed which is typical for construction companies in this market. The workers, project managers and management were very responsive and focused on making sure I was happy with the work. The quality of the remodel was excellent. I've gotten so many compliments from guests who have seen my gorgeous, new bathrooms."
5,"Look no further! The construction team from ""SOD Builders"" saved my life after a stupid contractor disappeared leaving my house roof bathroom and kitchen un-finished ,he left trash all over and my roof was open,uncovered and literally exposed to the rain,wind and weather...
I found SOD Builders on HOUZZ and made a decision to hire them after interviewing Oren and Michelle ,
They were able to address the issues we had and found ways to help us to complete the work in minimum time and cost (!!!).
Me and my wife can't explain how we thank this company since they are our new angels!!!
Thank you ! thank you ! Thank you!
We are going to recommend SOD to anyone who need construction and home improvement work!"
5,"We've remodeled several homes, and SOD Builders was by far the best experience we've ever had working with contractors. 
We remodeled our entire home and added 800SF to the back of the house.
The build pool house (we can't wait to use it this coming summer). Either Oren or Adam was on the Job Site almost every day, the workman were courteous and cleaned up after themselves, and the job was finished ahead of scheduled and turned out beautiful. We could not give a higher recommendation. Excellent company to work with."
2,"I've been waiting for awhile to write this review. I was genuinely hoping things would have worked out between us and SOD but that was not the case. To be completely upfront we never got to the actual building/construction part of our relationship with SOD. We worked with them for over a year and ultimately left with a sour taste in our mouth over the whole experience. I'm giving two stars because even though we didn't end up working with them their designer (Michele (sp?)) and some of their staff were great to work with. 

We wanted to do the following to our home:
Remodel master bathroom
Master bedroom - Install new flooring, paint, and sliding glass door/one window replaced (They quoted $10,000 for *just* this - FYI)
Stairs - refinished
Living - build a custom bar, resurface fireplace

We reached out to SOD through Houzz and they were prompt to reply. They sent someone out to give us a quote. Everything went fine, and we called a few times after that but never received the quote. After a few months (we were slow to follow-up too) they sent someone else out to give us another quote as it had been awhile since the first guy had come out to our house. That's when we started working with Michael and things went terribly from that point on. I mean very very terribly. 

Michael came out and did a walk through of the house with us. He was having a hard time grasping what we wanted and wasn't understanding our vision. On top of that we were having a hard time understanding him and what was included in their services. At this point we were becoming frustrated but Michael assured us everything would be fine. After a month we received the quote from him. It was extremely poorly written and we couldn't tell what was included and what wasn't. We had three separate phone calls with Michael and still couldn't tell what we were getting. We said we wanted to think it over for a few weeks. After a month we again contacted Michael and asked about the price difference between adding a bathtub to the master or not. He then told us we would need to pay him $5,000 for an architectural designer before he would do anymore with us. This set off major red flags for us. We were told before that design was included with SOD. Michael then said he was going to be out of town but he wanted to send his colleague, Ram, to our home to see it and take some measurements that he missed. We thought that was weird but agreed to call and set-up a time with Ram. After speaking with Ram it became VERY clear to Ram and to us that Michael hadn't work for SOD in over a month and Ram was very panicky because he thought Michael had told us when he clearly hadn't. The most alarming part was NO ONE FROM SOD EVER CALLED US TO TELL US. So, we almost signed a contract with some other company and didn't even know it....

At that point we called SOD and I feel like we were super reasonable since they never bothered to tell Michael's clients he had left the company. We just asked to meet with someone else. They sent their designer out to our home. She was great and really restored our faith in SOD. When the owner returned he came out and sent us a new quote. We were discouraged to see the same quote style from Michael and ended up having to have ANOTHER call with the owner to figure out what was included and what wasn't. We solved it by making a spreadsheet since about 10 items we asked for didn't show up in the quote AT ALL. After that we took their final numbers and compared them to what Michael provided us in his first quote when he actually worked for SOD and they were much higher. We approached the owned about the difference and he said - doesn't matter. I won't go down to that price. So, he wouldn't honor a price his former employee made and we spoke to SOD again. 

They never called us after that. They never made any attempt to do right by us even though they basically set us up with someone who tried to defraud us. I am honestly just 100% disappointed in the whole experience. 

I think they do great remodel/construction work if you can get past the poorly explained process, bad company organization, and lack of customer service. We didn't and we lost a year of our lives to it. I would not recommend SOD to anyone, and I don't think they care about what they did to us or how our project was handled."
5,"I met with Eran from SOD last Spring and he had a lot of great ideas for my kitchen and bath remodel. Their bid was very competitive and I selected SOD to do the project. One of the key differentiation was that Eran did 3D renderings of the space and we went through several rounds before finalizing the scope of work. This was a great way to finalize all of the details in a visual way, which saved me on hiring a designer and undoubtedly saved a lot of rounds of changes once construction began. Throughout the project, everyone from SOD was incredibly responsive and Eran was my point of contact throughout the entire project. He's easy to work with, highly service-oriented, and always available by phone/text or email.

SOD has a large team with plumbers, electricians and provides full services - from counters to flooring and shower doors. The quality of the work was very high and they were also receptive to getting the smallest details just right. I was most impressed after the job finished when Eran and team went above and beyond to make sure that every last detail was taken care of.

SOD is an entrepreneurial, modern construction company and I would use them again."
5,"I would definitely use SOD again for any future remodeling projects. During the initial process of getting bids from various vendors, they were not the cheapest or the most expensive, but they had the best customer service and that is what won me over. This being the first time I've ever done a remodel, I went over every detail of the bid and checked their referrals, licenses, insurance coverage, etc. Even before I committed, Daniel was super great at responding and answering all of my questions and putting me at ease. The process was painless and ""pressure free"" and I very much appreciate their approach.

Daniel was an absolute pleasure to work with and his team did a wonderful job. They were polite, courteous, considerate (they made sure to cover areas that they would be walking through, cleaned up the area daily, etc), and very accommodating during the entire process, especially with changes along the way. They remodeled both bathrooms at the same time from demolition to finish. It was hard living with both bathrooms being done simultaneously and seeing as how these were my only bathrooms in my home, my ""must-have"" was to have a working toilet during the remodel (showering could be done elsewhere, but a working toilet was deal breaker for me!). They not only finished ahead of schedule (total time: about 5 weeks), but they also did a few extra's for me i.e. installing a ceiling fan, replacing hallway ceiling lights. The results were remarkable and I couldn't be more pleased with the results. I've received many compliments on the work and have referred them to several friends and co-workers and will continue to do so.

I would not hesitate to use them again. When I remodel my kitchen, I plan on using them again."
5,"I chose SOD for a complete kitchen remodel and plumbing upgrade. Working with the designer Michelle was a pleasure.  She had a clear sense of what we were looking for and knew just when to offer her opinion as we were sorting through the dizzying array of options.  When the building actually began, everyone at SOD was easy to contact, the crew always professional.  There were a few glitches, but they were minor, nothing out of the ordinary for such an extensive job. 

Early in the process, Oren, the owner of the company, told me that he would do whatever it took to make sure I was happy at the end of the job--and he completely delivered.  There was no request that wasn't honored, no small issue that was ever contested. They never made me feel picky, even though there were times I felt that way.  Oren called me a few months after the job was done to make sure I was happy.  When I mentioned a few minor issues that had come up (a cabinet door was sticking and the faucet had worked a little loose) he had someone come out within a day to take care of them. SOD didn't give me the cheapest bid (they weren't the most expensive either, for the record) but it's worth a little extra money to find a builder that does beautiful work and is willing to work with you to make sure you're satisfied."
5,"Oren, the general contractor, gave us a bid that was reasonable and when he came to our house he brought his designer Michelle, who showed us pictures and gave us ideas about what could be done to our house.  Michelle was with us to help pick out tile, granite slabs, paint colors, and cabinet styles.  The job itself had one hic-up but was remidied by Oren.  The foreman/woman that was assigned to our job told us that if we had any questions we could call her day or night and she would be available.  This turned out not to be the case and Oren eventually let her go and we were given a new foreman, Robert, who was available whenever we needed help.
   Overall everything went well.  Oren had workers at our house just about every day and the workers were very professional in doing their jobs.  They even swept up at the end of the day so we wouldn't track dust into the rest of the house.  Our remodel started on January 6th and was completely finished by March 14th.  I have waited until now (6 months after completion) to see if anything went wrong before giving my review and I can honestly say that everything has held up well.  No cracks in the drywall, and no leaks anywhere.  Given all that was accomplished in just over 2 months I would say that Oren and his crew did a wonderful job."
5,"I am extremely pleased with the job that SOD Builders did for me: a full kitchen remodel, including a complete gut and redesign of the room.   The quality of their work was top-notch, the workers were always professional, respectful, and friendly.   In particular, SOD's designer was very helpful in bringing my vision to life.

No project of this magnitude is completely glitch free, but SOD was very responsive to my every request.  This is not a contractor you have to worry about deserting you mid-job.  

The answer to the ultimate question ""Would I hire them again for other work?"" is ""Absolutely"".  Though it took a bit longer than I would have liked to complete the job, in the end I couldn't be happier with the results.  I will enjoy this space for decades to come."
5,"We absolutely love Oren and SOD Builders, Inc.  After meeting with multiple contractors to remodel our entire home and we added 1500SF to it, Oren was a breath of fresh air.  He wasn’t pushy like most other contractors.  Instead, he was polite, knowledgeable, trustworthy and professional.  This project was our first re-model (pretty massive for first remodel) and we didn’t know anything about the process.  Oren guided us through everything from start to finish. He listened carefully to what we wanted, gave us suggestions, and showed us lots of examples on his computer of other homes he had remodeled and build.  Lance and Michelle went with us to stores to help us pick out everything in our home--appliances, tile, and counters. They built us all custom cabinets  He was patient and supportive, always offering his perspective and advice and helping us make color and style decisions.  He, Michelle (our head designer), and the rest of their team were all a pleasure to work with.  They were hardworking, polite, knowledgeable, paid attention to every detail, and showed true pride in their work.  Lesmi checked in with us every day, either by phone call or by email.  The crew cleaned up at the end of each day.  The team was so efficient that, despite us adding a few additional projects along the way, they finished the project ahead of schedule.  And, we are extremely happy with our new home.  It is more beautiful than we could have imagined and we are so thankful to Oren and his team.  We have already recommended SOD Builders to family and friends and are looking forward to having him redo our rental home in the near future."
5,"We called SOD to start a kitchen remodel.  During the time they quoting us on the kitchen our hall bathroom's pipes exploded and we decided this project was more pressing.  We were glad that we got to work with this company on a smaller project before tackling the huge project of our kitchen remodel.  SOD did an awesome job with the bathroom.  We are extremely happy with our new modern bathroom. It is beautiful.  We always felt comfortable with all the specialists that came to work on the house. The work they did was top notch.  Any questions or concerns we had during the project were addressed quickly.  They also helped us to figure out design details, and since this is not my forte we really appreciated the guidance.  

We were so happy with the bathroom remodel that they are working on our kitchen now.  It is coming together beautifully.  I would absolutely recommend them for any project that you have."
5,"We love our kitchen and what's even more amazing, we still love everyone at SOD.  Through every step of the way, we felt like Oren, Michelle and team did everything in their power to give us exactly what we wanted, or, as was often the case, something better than we could have imagined.   We are a bit clueless on the design front.  We knew we wanted a Dwell worthy high end kitchen that had warmth and natural stone elements while still being sleek and modern. We had no idea how to do this.  Michelle helped us design the kitchen, change the layout, reposition things, and redesign the kitchen again.  She helped us select materials, match stain samples, hardware, everything. And this ""call me anytime and I will pick up or call you immediately"" service is just part of the deal. It's how SOD operates. 

If there was ever anything that we were unhappy about, it was addressed immediately. I believe someone came out three times to make sure the wall of cabinetry fit into the soffit line perfectly. We chose an incredibly difficult tile to install for our backsplash. Each tile is individually cut and affixed to paper.  The tiler pulled out individual tiles that we felt were too dark or light or misshapen... dozens of them, until it looked perfect. They were very accommodating when working with the Miele specs for the custom panel refrigerator and even redid a panel when we saw a blemish. The cabinetry makers SOD uses are craftsmen and you can tell when you look at the end result and feel the substantial drawers and cabinets in your hand. The cabinetry and drawer hardware used is on par with what Poggenpohl and Boffi.  After months and months of hard use, I still get a little thrill every time the drawers soft close smoothly. 

When we were conducting our search we were looking for quality, excellent customer service and affordability. SOD provides all of these. NOT ONCE did we feel taken advantage of or overcharged in any way. Our quote did not change.  There weren't any hidden costs or fees.  In fact, we found that we were so on budget that we were able to splurge on our cabinet hardware and backsplash.

It has been nine months and we have not had a single issue with anything in our kitchen.  It is still beautiful, it still looks new and it is very, very user friendly.  This is a kitchen used and abused by children but appreciated by adults. 

We couldn't be happier and will use SOD again in the near future."
5,"Professional, clean, knowledgable and punctual. They finished building our new roof before a week was over and did not leave a mess! 

I'd definitely hire them again."
4,"I sent an urgent request to SOD builder to get a bid for my bathrooms and garage remodeling project due to the water damage at home. SOD customer service was really nice. After I canceled my first appointment, they were able to schedule a project manager to visit my place according to my time. The project Manager was helpful and professional. We got the estimates within 3 days."
5,"I had a guest bathroom remodel job and met with approximately four contractors. SOD Builders came in with a cost that was within our budget. We broke the job up into two stages, the first was a demo of a 3x3 shower and build a walk in tile shower that can accommodate ageing parents with a grab bar, shower bar, soap shelf and seat. New tile was laid and our new shower was a nice combo of large tile, glass tile mosaic and stainless steel appointments and a seat. Oren and his crew took about two weeks for the complete job which also included installing a shower light fan combo, paint and trim. The second portion of the rebuild was the installation of a new vanity and placing tile where the old vanity once stood. This vanity was not made for a corner and SOD builders took the marble splash guard and matched it to another piece to create a corner vanity unit. We are very pleased with the work performed and the crew that worked on this job. We would highly recommend SOD builders for your construction / remodel jobs."
5,"Services provided:
Completely remodeled the kitchen, updated 2 bathrooms, completely remodeled the master bathroom, relocated the laundry room, installed attic insulation, replaced all windows and interior/exterior doors, and installed wood flooring.

Details:
Oren and Michal, his designer, were fantastic to work with.  Oren and Michal both met with us to walk through our home and understand the project we wanted to do.  Oren's bid was competitive, but the biggest reason we decided to hire him is because we could see how passionate he is about his work and we felt that Michal's vision was a perfect match for the look and feel we were going for.

Michal was very helpful in the planning phase and helped design our kitchen layout and cabinets, as well as our master bathroom.  She was also extremely helpful when it came time to start picking finishes.  She totally understood our style and helped us narrow down design options.  In addition, she was not afraid to let us know when she felt that we may be making choices that we could regret.  We greatly valued her opinions and support!

We had bought an older home that needed a lot of updating and improvement, so the job was quite big.  Luckily, we were not living in the home during the remodel.  However, we stopped by to check the progress at least a couple of times per week and were always impressed that the workers cleaned up after themselves each day and stored their tools even though they knew we weren't living there.  Whenever we did see the workers, they were always pleasant and courteous.  

About mid-way through the project, Oren's foreman leading up our project left the company.  This caused some delays, but the new foreman, Hector, was even better than the first and did everything he could to help make up for lost time.  We had told Oren from the beginning that he could take his time because we weren't in any hurry to move in (we were living at my father's house so that I could take care of him until he passed away from cancer).  The project was completed about 2 months behind schedule, but we had added some work to the original scope and wanted Oren to take his time to make sure everything was done exactly how we wanted it.  

We have now lived in our home for about 3 months.  After we moved in we began to notice certain issues and defects and kept a running list of items to be fixed.  Oren sent his crew back out about a month ago and fixed everything on our list with great attention to detail.  We could not be any happier with our ""new"" (old) home!

We have worked with other contractors on smaller projects at our previous homes before and they always quoted us much lower, but the final bill was much higher and the quality of the work was lacking.  We paid Oren exactly what he originally quoted us and are very happy with the results.  We would highly recommend Oren for his professionalism, attention to detail, and passion for his work.  He is an honest person and demands the same level of honesty and quality from his crew."
5,"I was impressed by SOD Builders commitment to satisfaction. We had lots of small details that we wanted to do right and Oren was absolutely willing to get all the little things done properly, and without a charge. The most impressive thing was that we agreed on a price at the start and Oren stuck to it even when it would cost him extra money to get right.

They did also a very good job of keeping my place clean, keeping things running while doing construction, and overall being very responsible and with a great regard to quality!"
5,"SOD Builders is a one-stop shop to my dream house.  With a complete team of project manager, designer, architect, licensed plumber/electrician, tile/floor specialists, painters, carpenters... they can put together pretty much any requests that you may dream up for your projects.  They did a gut renovation for me on an entire floor including demolishing and rebuilding a kitchen and 2 bathrooms, removing popcorn ceiling and smoothing out textured walls, updating all plumbing and electrical and putting in new hardwood floor.  SOD Builders provided high-quality work, expert advice and top-notch customer services.  The one thing the owner, Oren, said to me most often during the project was “whatever makes you happy, we’ll do it!” and they do!  They are very flexible to unexpected changes and always accommodating to the needs of the customers.  I picked out all the floors and tiles I wanted, and the project manager, Adi, helped me looked all over California to find the best prices for the materials.  When a part of the fireplace didn’t turn out looking like the design I had in mind, they immediately sent a team to rebuild the area to change it to look exactly like what I wanted.  For the bathrooms, we decided to put up tiles on all walls, we originally thought since all the walls were also newly built, installing the cement boards under the tiles would be sufficient enough, but Oren insisted on using the floating cement because he believes the method makes the bathrooms much more durable and provides better quality even though it was more costly to him and took longer to build.  There were many examples like these throughout the project.  I would highly recommend SOD Builders to anyone."
5,"Services Provided: 
Combined a kitchen area with a breakfast area, pushed out an exterior wall, enlarged the opening between the kitchen and dinning room, gutted the entire area, redesigned the ceiling in a pyramid fashion to solve the problem that the breakfast area had a vaulted ceiling, installed two new large windows then built an unbelievably beautiful, entirely functional high end kitchen.  We were so pleased with the work we had SOD remodel two bathrooms, a laundry room and install new linen cabinets in a hallway.  They also installed a beautiful large garden window in the dinning room.
Comments: 
If you are looking for an honest contractor who can make your most ambitious dreams come true, look no further than SOD Builders.  I alrey had my own idea (I even had my own drawings) of how my new kitchen should look.  I interviewed several highly rated contractors but I selected SOD for several reasons.  I met with the Project Manager, the Head Carpenter and Oren Dragan, the owner, all of whom seemed completely confident that they could meet my every expectation.  SOD did not give me the lowest bid I received, nor was it the highest but I was impressed by the fact that all of the major trades people were employed directly by Oren.  That meant that they were hand selected by and responsible directly to him.  It also meant that scheduling the various trades would be easier.  It turned out that all of the tradesmen (Carpenters, Plumbers, Electricians, Cabinet Makers, Tile Installers, Painters, etc.) were highly skilled, professional and hard working individuals who worked together like a well-honed team.  While the basic plan was mine, the end result was more than I could have imagined due to the experienced and creative input of Oren's team.  Joe, the Head Carpenter, came up with the idea of the tiered ceiling to beautifully unite the kitchen ceiling with the breakfast area ceiling which was vaulted.  He even took the time to build a model of his idea out of a cardboard box to give us a visual of his concept.  I could not ever improve on Golan's, the Cabinet Maker's designs for the cabinets.  Every drawer and cabinet were perfectly placed and completely functional. All the drawer open to the full extent.  All of the drawers and cabinet door have soft-close hinges.  The corner cabinet has a lazy susan.  There are slide-outs under the sinks and in the pantries.  Best of all, all of the pots and pans fit in drawers.  The large flat screen TV in the kitchen looks like it is part of the cabinetry.  The quality of the wood and the workmanship could not have been better.  The same quality and devotion to perfection was true of carpenters, plumbers, electricians, tile installers, painters and countertop fabricators.  All of the workers arrived on time every day, worked hard all day long (no goofing off) and cleaned up the area every day before they left.  This project passed all inspections with flying colors.  Oren Dragan made sure that every detail was completed to perfection.  I definitely would use SOD Builders again and I will highly recommend the Company to my friends and neighbors.  It was a no-hassle pleasure to work with Oren and his team."
5,"We first heard of SOD through another review company.  They had the highest review rate and highest score.  So, we gave them a call.  

My wife and I had a very good idea of what we wanted and how much we were willing to spend.  I had originally built this bathroom (and addition) so I had a base knowledge in construction.  When SOD arrived they were very professional and respectful and came with a slew of referrals..  They listened to our ideas and then offered modifications to enhance our vision.  We were very happy with all their changes to our initial design and even more delighted in that most of these opinions actually lowered our costs.  Their offer was many thousands below the nearest competitor and their ideas were superior to any views we had previously heard.  Their time frame was 3 weeks from start of demo to final inspection.

It was several weeks before they began but once they started, they moved quickly and efficiently.  They took great care to cover and isolate the house from their work area.  Demo occurred with the workers transiting the house in a plastic ""tunnel"" so as not to scatter dust and debris.  All materials were quickly hauled off site.  Each phase progressed similarly with the workers taking great care of the non-involved portion of the house before they began work on the bathroom.  I must give credit to Hector (the foreman) for providing a seamless transition from one phase to the next and being on site to take care of each question or request we had.  He was very quick to rectify or resolve any ""problem"" we had.  Another lido needs to go to SOD's tile man.  His work is superb.  When my wife was unable to visualize the new ceramic floor, he painstakingly arranged the floor in each of 3 patterns so she could choose which one best fit her initial vision.  Once decided, he applied the tiles (floor, shower walls and shower floors) to perfection.  The SOD plumber did a very good job of removing an existing water heater (left in place during the demo) and installing the new tankless one without leaving us hot waterless for more than an hour.  A very good feat!   SOD would have finished under 3 weeks but we opted to use a granite provider from whom we were able to procure a pice of fusion granite.  That change forced SOD to hold off on 4 days of work but they neither complained or asked for a change order.  

I am able to give SOD Builders the highest rating due to their work ethics, abilities and final product.  I have all ready referred them to 2 of my friends who are having work done to their homes.  You wont go wrong using this company. 

(this review has also been posted on another referral site by me, the homeowner)

5,"It was a pleasure working with SOD Builders from start to finish! Oren and Michelle came to our house and the end result is way beyond our expectations, WE LOVE OUR NEW HOME!
Oren & Michelle, were the third estimate that we received, they were not the lowest bid but they were very competitive they offered a new design and layout that no other company had thought of, I guess that’s a big difference when you have an in house designer (and no it does not effect on pricing, we had other companies that came and gave higher bid with no designer included). The new layout is great they were able to open up the space in our living room to the kitchen, my house looks like a picture in a fancy magazine, and it is very efficient when it comes to the use of the space.
The kitchen is just stunning and I’m so happy I can show off when I have friends over. When we bought the house the space was divided and it had a feeling of old and small and not so friendly.
The working process was very easy, I was always informed; the crew was always friendly and professional. When question and issues arise Oren and Michelle were available through there system very promptly, and I always had the feeling that there will be no compromising on the quality of work nor my satisfaction.
At the end, we are very happy with SOD builders, now I’m trying to convince my husband on remodeling our master bathroom; it has to match my new modern living space J will keep you posted.
SOD Builders it was great, thank you!"
5,"I had a great experience with SOD Builders. They ended up doing several projects for me, remodeling my master bath and my kitchen as well as retiling my front entry way and adding lighting to my living room. They seemed to work efficiently and completed the projects in a timely manner. 
  I am quite happy with the quality of their work as well as they way they seem to stand by it. Working with SOD was a really positive experience for me. And even though my house is almost 40 years old I’ve been told by more then one person the kitchen looks like a model home and the changes I’ve made have let the house come alive again. I would absolutely work with SOD builders again."
5,"SOD Builders has done a great job with our massive construction project.  The built us a new structure (garage/guesthouse) and now we are in the process of renovating our yard.  They have built a fence, laid flagstone, and are currently building a veranda.  They do great work for a fair price!"
5,"We had to replace a a bathroom ceiling light/heat/fan in our condo with no attic and had ""hole"" left in the ceiling after the electrician completed their job.  Had three companies quote on this job to drywall and repaint our entire bathroom a long with repairing the ""peeling"" areas around the tile and re-grouting our entire tub area.
SOD Builders was the highest cost, but carried all the insurance, including workman's comp and was very professional...and  at the end of the day---you get what you pay for!  The work that they did was outstanding - the drywall work that they did on our ceiling is like ""art""...you would never even know that it had been cut open.  They took care of all the details and made sure that we were VERY happy and they did what they said they would do - they got the entire job done within two days where everyone one else was quoting at least five days and with multiple vendor partners...?  Would recommend this company and will use them again!  Thank you SOD Builders for taking on this small project"
5,"SOD Builders painted the outside of our house and replaced damaged  patio deck around our pool. 

We were very pleased with the end results of both jobs and would recommend SOD Builders."
5,"SOD Builders re-did our Master Bathroom recently. They had a window of about 6 weeks to tear out the old bathroom and replace it with everything new, including new plumbing, electrical, carpentry, tiles, shower, basin, granite counter top, toilet, heated floor, etc. We had some idea as to what we wanted for our bathroom, but, didn't really didn't know how to put them all together. SOD Builders accommodated us, on occassion having to redo work because we thought it would look better some other way. Their Foreman Joe's favorite response to all of our requests was, ""not a problem, just let us know what you want"". Oren, the owner, believes that the Customer's satisfaction is so important that he is willing to have his workers do whatever is necessary to satisfy his customers. They did all the work, passed all the inspections, completed the work in 6 weeks, to our satisfaction. One thing, to us, ""after sales service"" is very important. How responsive is SOD Builders to a ""call back"" to refinish grouting because of shifting cracks, etc. Oren told us to not hesitate to call them back. I'm sure this will not be an issue for us."
5,"Love Oren's work. He was very professional throught the entire work. I had a wall removed that divided kitchen from living room. he came rightaway and gave me a quote, he explained the details of the work and possible complications. he also gave me an estimated time to finish, which he kept. Love his work, right away he sent, engineers, got city permits and started demolition. his workers were friendly and were ontime eveday, clean after their work each and everyday, protected my furniture from dust. at the end there was several complication that occur. most of which he had worn me about, and he went ahead and took care of them at no extra charge. will definetelly use their service again. top rated on angies list too."
5,"I hired SOD Builders to remodel our bathroom. The entire crew was extremely courteous, professional and thoughtful. 
Since we had to move out of our house during this time, they accommodated our needs and were flexible and understanding. The workmenship was first class and the service they provided was above and beyond. What I appreciated the most was that I was communicated on a daily basis what was going to happen and where we were with the progress.
I will utiilze them for kitchen project in the future. Thank you SOD team."
5,"We hired SOD to remodel our bathroom.  We interviewed three different contractors, and we went with Oren.   He and his workers did a great job--a very reasonable cost, and they were all very respectful and professional.  More than anything, I found that Oren was a trustworthy person, as he never tried to pull anything or do anything that I had questions about.   The project came off better than I had envisioned, and for the total cost that he had first estimated.  When we are ready to do another remodeling job, we will be sure to use Oren and SOD Builders."
5,"I own a company that deals with real estate investments.
We are using SOD Builders, INC services very often.
In the last 3 years we used them for several construction projects that involve a complete renovation of a house and other maintenance works for our apartment buildings. they are located conveniently in Tarzana.
I must say that they never let me down. Always on time, very professional and courteous, Fast and efficient.
Overall I have to say when I see them work I get to appreciate what they do. It is a hard work.
I will definitely continue using them and also recommend to friends and family."
5,Replaced our roof and completed remodeling projects because of longtime water damage. The projects were completed on time and on budget. The workmanship was excellent. SOD was truly professional and honest regarding all aspects of our projects. I would highly recommend this company.
5,"EXCELLENT.  From start to finish Oren was a pleasure to work with and his crew was always polite and punctual and absolutely 
cleaned up after themselves each and every day.  My neighbors had no idea we were doing such an extensive job in our yard
We would highly recommended SOD Builders if you are looking for any type of job and we are actually in talks right now about moving inside to start the interior.."
5,"I have an AMAZING bathroom thanks to SOD, Oren, the owner is a sweetheart, his guys were great especially Joe and his beautiful blue eyes!   Joe helped put it all together, kept everyone in check.  The Tile guy Jaime is an artist and matched every seam, framed the shower shampoo boxes as if they were a picture.  The Plumber William was excellent.  Oren delivered everything he promised.  

I highly recommend Oren and SOD Builders, I will be using them again when I renovate my other two bathrooms and kitchen which I hope will be soon."
5,"Our old, disgusting kitchen was in desperate need of a remodel.  We wanted everything replaced as well as two of the walls removed so that the kitchen would be more open to the rest of the house.  

Oren and his team were great from the beginning.  He gave us his initial quote and a completion date before he started and he stuck to both the entire time.  Naturally, lots of issues/fixes appeared during the remodel (since we went down to studs and it's an old house), but Oren always took care of everything and never charged us more.  His guys did an incredible job gutting the kitchen, replacing the floor, cabinets, fixtures, appliances, painting, tiling, rewiring, building a new pantry, removing the old walls, installing new support beams, everything.  His crew changed often, but everybody was friendly and cleaned up as best they could at the end of each day.  

There were a few things that needed to be done more than once since Oren was not present every day to supervise  (we had a countertop installed wrong, some crooked outlets, etc.).  That said, Oren ALWAYS immediately fixed the problem at no cost to me as soon as possible (and nothing delayed the completion date we were originally given.)  Speaking of -- Oren was always available through email (he uses Basecamp), phone, texting, etc.  We never waited more than an hour for a response to our question or concern.

In addition, we liked Oren and his team so much we also had them replace our galvanized plumbing under the house and our electrical panel.  Both were his suggestion, but the decision was left to us, and we never felt pressured.

All in all, I think the pictures speak for themselves.  Our kitchen was dated and unappealing and SOD turned it into our dream kitchen at the initial price they promised and by the time they promised it by.  Oren was always easy to work with, his guys were friendly, and we couldn't be happier with the finished result.  We definitely plan to use SOD Builders again."
5,"Oren & Gil from SOD did a complete remodel of our kitchen. We purchased appliances, but they did everything else; gutted the existing kitchen and floor, installed brand new electrical, plumbing, floor, walls and even removed a load-bearing wall to open up the kitchen to the den. They took care of all of the permits, inspections, & fees. Member Comments: We interviewed 7 contractors, four from word of mouth and  three through Angie's list. One by one they came through and spoke with us about cost, design, how they operated and timelines. Each one either had their own idea of how they would do it, or was way to high in price, or just indifferent, but when SOD Builders, Ore & Gil stopped by they made us feel very comfortable, they helped us see our vision. They started right away with demo and worked quickly, they seem to be very well organized and since they have their own electricians, carpenters and plumbers on staff, there was no waiting for the sub-contractor to stop by.
They had a cabinet company and tile folks that we worked with to pick out new cabinets, floor tile and back splash, as well as sink, faucets, even a pasta or pot-filler over the stove. They made it very care-free and they took care of every detail and didn't charge for minor change orders. When we asked about the load bearing wall, they were unsure until their engineer came to visit, so they even gave us an estimate on the cost, in advance, just in case we did need to do the extra work and knowing the price upfront gave us piece of mind. In fact when we did have to do the extra work, they stuck to their quote. 
What I really love about working with SOD Builders was their positive attitude and a willingness to make us happy and to stick with their original quote and NO SURPRISES. 
We really enjoyed working with SOD and we are already getting quotes for a patio renovation."
5,"First and foremost, our kitchen looks amazing!  Every time we now step into it, we’re validated that we made all the right decisions.     

We recently purchased our first home which had an outdated kitchen and a backyard patio in need of improvement so we called S.O.D. for a kitchen remodel and enclosed patio estimate.  Upon first meeting Oren, it’s clear that one word to describe him as is Confident.  Confident in his abilities, confident he would come in on budget, and confident we would be happy with S.O.D. in the end.  And he was right.  They weren’t the cheapest estimate but we can’t imagine the quality we received at any lower price.  Plus, the unexpected perks we received (a new linen closet, extending our wall in our laundry area) more than made up for a slightly higher total price.  Also, they were able to come down in price for the covered patio (which also turned out great!) in order to match a competitor’s price and stay within our budget.  

The whole process took about a month and a half (they were kicked out for a week because we had our floors refinished) which was very close to their original time estimate.  They also kept the arduous city-inspector process as smooth as possible and Oren was always accessible by text, phone or email (even meeting with us on Sundays) and he always gave updates throughout the remodel.  

Overall, it was a positive experience with a great result.  We would definitely recommend to anyone looking to remodel."
5,"I have SOD Builders did a remodel to our two bathrooms at the end of 2010. I had good experience with the team. Compared to other two contractors I hired for other remodeling for my home 3 years ago, SOD Builders were much more responsible. They responded promptly, stick to the budget as well. As a designer myself, I think they are very professional and knew the code very well. And I was satisfied with the work they did. I would be glad to recommend them to others."
5,"I cannot recommend these guys enough. Seriously, my family was in the middle of a mold crisis. Twice in two years. The first time someone recommended that I contact Oren and I did. Boy was I glad I did. He came out RIGHT away, helped me and my young kids, took care of everything, figured out what the real problem was (which honestly no one else had been able to do til that point), and then completely saved us. He totally treated us like we were his own family. Responsive, quick, efficient, kind. Knew what he was doing. Had awesome guys working for him that we totally trusted. When we found ourselves needing more help (for different reasons)  the next year, I knew who to call. and again he swooped in and saved us. SERIOUSLY, CALL HIM. His prices were beyond fair, and I really came to just totally depend on him. I am so glad someone referred him to us, and am happy to forward the favor. He really made us feel safe and important and not gouged and did everything he said he would. and did it well. quickly. what more can you ask for??

btw, let me add that i have referred oren to many many people now and they have all been super happy. seriously, he is a gem. LOOK NO FURTHER."
5,"SOD Builders did a complete home renovation for us (new kitchen, new laundry room, new floors and carpets, interior & exterior paint, electrical re-wire, plumbing, new doors, the works). The end product is beautiful, well-constructed, and they were a pleasure to work with. Very professional, very responsive and trustworthy. We look forward to working with them in the future!"
1,"I hired this company and pd $1500 for design work for my backyard. The returned work was deplorable, and the company even admitted that they were having a hard time keeping designers and they had to push it out to a 3rd party. After numerous calls and emails (which weren’t returned) I decided to write this off to good advertising on a sports radio show."
5,"After reviewing and researching multiple landscape companies, my wife and I reached out to Outdoor Makeovers to do a complete gut of our backyard, and when I say gut, I mean a complete demolition.   Navid came out and reviewed our ideas and the current state of our backyard.  He provided better alternatives in design and flow, which we had not initially considered.   We were very pleased and impressed with his design and knowledge and decided to move forward with the project.   

The scope of our project included complete demolition, two patios (one raised) with a fire pit, new sod, mulch and a build out for a hot tub.  Navid provided video updates throughout the project, which, in total, was completed in less than two weeks.  For the size and scope of our project, we were very impressed and almost in shock of how quickly it all came together.  That just goes to show you the dedication of his team.  We were very pleased with the final design and how it came to life with the complete makeover that his team delivered on.  We initially held off writing this review to give time for things to settle.  That said, COVID set in and it actually allowed us to enjoy our new time in the backyard even more than we initially expected. 

Recently, we reengaged with Navid to address a minor issue with how a section of one of the patio’s pavers had settled.  His team came back out and within the day completely remediated the issue.  This goes to show that Outdoor Makeovers stands behind their craftsmanship and reaffirms the reason why we selected this company for our “little” paradise in our backyard.

1,"After reading reviews, not surprised I saw a couple others where they took consult fees under false pretenses. Saw the same on another site so again how are they getting such great reviews?? Whether $35 or $250, deliberately taking customers consult fee is plain dishonest. I lost my consult fee also, with no services or usable advice given. They appeared to lose interest in giving a good consult when I informed them I was getting other quotes. I am sure consult fees are part of how they make money.The amount of excellent 5 star reviews look very suspicious especially since this was mentioned by the rep several times and the ideas were very standard and similar to other vendors. Not hard to create great fake reviews for your company.

Most importantly, the quote was also so high it was ridiculous! There are much more affordable companies out there who do great work. Shop around."
5,"Navid and his teams were outstanding. From day one Outdoor Makeover & Living Spaces displayed exceptional creativity and project management. We had a few ideas on what we wanted to do with our front and back yards, but Navid and his team took what we wanted to another level. Not only did their final product greatly exceed our expectations, but they also turned it around quicker than first planned. Our yard now has a ""wow"" factor to it - my family and I now love to be in our backyard! Yes, we spent a lot of money - but the quality of work and material used was 100% worth it. Every member of the team worked hard and took great pride in their work - and it showed. Thank you Navid and crews!!"
5,"This is our 2nd project with the outdoor team. Our first project was in October 2019 and we reached out to start our 2nd project in May 2020. Working in phases helped us to stay in budget and was a great decision for us. The Outdoor team had our phase 2 patio and covered pergola done by July 1. (Cost for phase 2 was $39,000) So about 6 weeks to complete our incredible project. My favorite thing about the Outdoor crew is that every one of their workers does high quality work. They truly treat your project as if they were working on their own yard. Although this is an outdoor space it feels like we gained more living square footage on our house. Functional, comfortable, and attractive, it was a great way to enhance our home’s value."
5,"This is the second time we've worked with Navid and Outdoor Makeover, and once again we were thrilled with our choice! This latest project involved two retaining walls, a complete regrading of the backyard and added drainage, new walkways and trees. It was a total transformation that is both functional and beautiful, and we're so grateful to Navid and his team (especially Eddie and Sam) for taking such good care of it. They were responsive, respectful, and incredibly thorough. They also made sure our neighbor was completely happy because the retaining wall replacement involved removing and replacing some of her fence. While the quote might come in a bit higher than some other places, you absolutely get what you pay for in terms of the materials, quality of the work, and customer service. We can't recommend Navid and his team at Outdoor Makeover enough!"
5,"Navid and his crew at Outdoor Makeover just completed our big backyard landscaping project which involved moving a lot of dirt, taking out trees and replanting new ones and building multiple retaining walls. From the onset Navid provided great input on how to design our yard and gave realistic advise on how to save costs. Our yard turned out great and far surpassed our expectations."
5,I just had Outdoor Makeover put in a patio.  These guys are the best.  First they help you to design your space with helpful ideas that help you to end up with a finished project better then you expected.  They show up on time and clean up at the end of each day.  True turnkey job.
5,"My backyard looks amazing the Outdoor Makeover & Living Spaces crew is very dedicated and definitely worked very very hard. It is unbelievable that the work was actually completed in 2 days. The communication between Navid, Brian, his foreman and the crew was excellent. 
A minor issue was quickly corrected to my satisfaction. The price was reasonable (not cheap), but the money is well-worth it. My only criticism would be the time between hiring and beginning of the work. With that stated, we did hire Outdoor Makeover & Living Spaces in the midst of the COVID pandemic, when most people were working on landscaping and property renovation. We would definitely hire the team for future projects"
5,"Navid and team are great to work with! They are professional, thorough, and on-time. We had them redo our front yard and walkway, which turn out beautiful. This is our second project with the team and we would recommend them again and again."
5,"Great experience! We met with Navid for the initial consultation. He was very thorough and gave us ideas for the backyard we never considered. The consultation was well worth the cost, and because he helped in the design process, the finished product was much better than I initially expected. The initial design was a bit more expensive than we were willing to pay so Navid worked with us to get the design within our budget.  We actually settled on a design a bit below our budget, and he advised us to budget an extra X% for unknowns that could happen while under construction. That was really helpful because as the project progressed, there were a few additions and changes that really helped make the finished product better than expected. Once the project began, Navid stayed connected and I saw him regularly. When the crews arrived without Navid, each of the different leads he assigned for demolition (Ivan), construction (Gerardo) , and the landscape (Giovanni), had intimate knowledge of"
5,"After reading several outstanding reviews, we contacted Outdoor Makeover to seek help in transforming our wooded backyard into a landscape that we could use and enjoy.  From the moment we contacted them (initially speaking with Tina), we realized and experienced their wonderful customer service – very friendly and client-centered.  This was perhaps the most important quality we were seeking in working with a landscape company, and Outdoor Makeover excelled in this area from beginning to end.  We experienced the professionalism and workmanship of Outdoor Makeover as second to none.  We recommend Outdoor Makeover without reservation (and would gladly give them more than 5 stars!), and are grateful to have worked with the Outdoor Makeover team and experience their fantastic customer service and work."
5,"We had a wonderful experience with KraftMaster Renovations!  The entire team were fantastic to work with.  We enjoyed having 24/7 access to the team and all job information via their platform.  Everyone on the team was attentive, friendly, professional and talented at their job.  Having our kitchen renovated, Carly designed a great plan and Chris the project manager was there with us every step of the way and always popped by if we needed him.  We work mostly from home and found it to be a smooth process for the job to take place during our work hours.  We never felt out of the loop, or waiting for answers.  If there were even the smallest touch ups or changes, they would return asap and handle.  Shout out to Steve, Nick & Robbie - great job guys.  Plus Chris and the electrician team!  Highly recommended."
5,"It is without hesitation that I provide a recommendation for KraftMaster Renovations (KraftMaster) and their team.  KraftMaster exceeded our expectation at every stage, and delivered on-time.  Over the entire length of the project, KraftMaster met each weekly deliverable, and it was clear what the next steps were.  KraftMaster’s lead designer, Maureen, was incredible to work with.  She is a great listener and picked up exactly what we were looking for – an open space with the ability to close off certain areas for privacy.  The transformation of the space is beyond words.   I remember at our initial meeting, Maureen commented that we had plenty of room to meet our needs, I was skeptical, but she definitely proved me wrong.  
Alexandra was simply amazing at sourcing things and being very practical.  We were looking for a set of custom glass sliders which were well beyond what we budgeted for, however, she was able to find a much more reasonable set of glass sliders which gave the aesthetic of exactly what we were looking for.   We loved all the trades that were involved in our project.  Each one of them were very professional and it was evident that they each took a lot of pride in doing the work carefully and going above and beyond to deliver.  At the project outset, Bob had a team meeting with all the trades to go through the project, open up a few walls to determine if there were any issues at the beginning.  At this point, we were introduced to our project manager, Chris.  Chris was always reachable and very responsive.  He was great at problem solving, and made a great suggestion about tile we had chosen to go around the fireplace.   The job site was cleaned up every day, and all trades were great at answering all my questions.  Our carpenter team consistently mostly of Peter and Walter.  Not only are they both incredible at their work, both of them were so pleasant to be around.  I enjoyed my daily chats with both of them.   I was very impressed with how they hung our fireplace mantle, which consisted of a reclaimed solid piece of barnwood which probably weighed close to 600 lbs.  The plumbers were great.  Moon, Danny & Mike are very good at what they do.  They even diagnosed that our plumbing lines in our laundry room were crossed for the washing machine so when we thought we were using cold water, we were in fact using hot water.  I was impressed with their work ethic that if they found something that wasn’t right, they were going to address it.  The electricians also went above and beyond.  The team consisted of Chris, Nick and Renan.  Their work was incredibly neat, it was evident that they took no short cuts in running lines back to the main junction box.  The tiling expert, Bogden, is a true artisan.  He would spend hours laying out the tiles first before he cut anything to ensure everything lined up perfectly.  

KraftMaster transformed our space to our needs, and we thoroughly enjoy it every day."
5,"Kraftmaster crated a beautiful bathroom for us from a connected room to our master bedroom. The room and the side of the house it was on had no plumbing but the Moon, Danny, and Mike did a great job analyzing how to best get pipes to the room. Krftmaster provides a full service construction service and it starts with interviews and then design. Carly listed to what we wanted out of the renovation and then provided us with 3 different designs with different budgets to choose from. We then went shopping together to work together to pick out the tiles, counter materials, sinks, toilets, fixtures, etc. They have lots of knowledge around these things and can answer any question.

As the project commenced it was great to see a project plan we had access to and could communicate with the team. Chris was our project manager and Steve was our go-to for whatever it was that was needed at a moments notice. The project started on-time and during a difficult time of year when we had multiple snowstorms that made roads underivable and many areas with power outages. This affected the schedule a bit but delays were communicated and justified and they weren't that long.

The carpenters and electricians did great work (Chris, Nick, and Renan are precise electricians - every screw on the switch plates is aligned up-and-down which just shows you their attention to detail) and the tile work was amazing. Bogdan is an incredibly skilled and throughout tile-person and spent considerable time on the mud job and tile work. Super precise.

What was great was that near the end of the job we weren't 100% happy with the alignment of a towl-rack (we made some changes to plans during construction and the carpenter who installed it didn't see the update, it happens) and I pointed it out to Chris who agreed it should be fixed. It wasn't an easy fix as the tiles had to be broken off and replaced the the bar realigned, but they did it and it promptly. 

The end result is a perfect bathroom that suits the home.

I'm already planning a second project with Kraftmaster."
5,"Where can I begin!  This whole process has been organized, trustworthy, smooth and remarkable! Using KraftMaster for our recent master bathroom renovation was the best decision we've made and we know exactly who to call for the next project!  We are now enjoying the bathroom we have always wanted!!!

We have a 1928 Tudor-style house, so it was important to make updates that reflect the style of this house.  Carly and Bob took their time with us at the beginning as we carefully figured out how to achieve a spacious master bathroom with a tub, shower, double sink vanity, and walk-in closet.  This was a HUGE project as we went into a spare room to create a master walk-in closet. They were very creative and mindful of our budget and allowed us to make decisions that we were comfortable with. Carly held my hand with the designs from start to finish in a way that was fun and supportive- she's amazing.  Nick, Robbie, and Carlos made the project come to life and I am so grateful for them! When the job was finished I missed seeing them. The plumbing crew- Moon, Danny, and Mike do such great work we have called them back to help us out with other issues that have come up. Steve, Chris, and Alexandra round out this awesome team with friendly service and work ethic that is hard to come by these days.

I am so grateful that Bob and his team took on this HUGE project and gave us the bathroom of our dreams!  It truly is a showstopper!  Thanks, KraftMaster! You will be hearing from us sooner than you think :)"
5,"We contracted with KraftMaster Renovations in 2020 to renovate our 1960's kitchen.  We couldn't have made a better choice.  The entire process was almost flawless.  Carly, our designer, immediately understood our style and goals, guiding us through the selection of materials.  Chris, our project manager, and Alexandra, our project coordinator, kept the schedule running perfectly with minimal delays, in spite of Covid.
Carpenters, Peter and Walter, plumbers, Danny, Moon and Mike, electricians, Chris, Ryan and Renan, all did an excellent job bringing the design to life.
We will certainly call Bob Gockeler and Kraftmaster for our next project."
5,"We were very pleased with the work of KraftMaster Renovations. We hired them for a second floor reconfiguration, redoing nearly 90 year old bathrooms and in turn slightly reconfiguring two bedrooms. They also helped us with installing HVAC in our home. From the day Bob and Julie walked into our home for a consultation, to the celebratory day they picked up the floor protection, their team treated our house and our family with great respect. They supported our desire to stay in keeping with the house, and as they noticed certain design features of our home, suggested we incorporate them into our renovations. For example, we have a lot of crown molding in our home and instead of ripping it off and throwing it away, they suggested they put it back after door frames were put back on. That is one example of their thoughtfulness and consideration during our renovations. 
Maureen helped us design beautiful space. Nick and his team, Moon and his team, and Chris and his team were kind and respectful, guided us well, clearly communicated what they were doing, and when it came up, what surprises we were faced with (only one major one!). Their work is impeccable, and we continually enjoy our home and new spaces. We highly recommend their work and do plan to use them for future projects."
5,"I have had the pleasure of working with Bob and Julie on two major projects.  One, a kitchen renovation and more recently, a whole house overhaul which included  gutting and updating a kitchen, three bathrooms, and redesigning some of the floor plan so it would work better for our family. 

 Kudos to Maureen who helped me achieve the modern farmhouse feel that we were hoping for.  She and her assistant Alexandra were  a pleasure to work with, patiently walking us through every decision we had to make and there were plenty!  

The construction crews starting with the demolition right on through to finish carpentry are a talented bunch, always friendly, respectful and doing their best to bring the project to life.  

I highly recommend Bob, Julie and their team for any renovation project you might have in mind!"
5,"From the moment we met with Bob, Julie, and Maureen through to completion they made us feel at ease. We had an idea of how we wanted our kitchen to look, but by partnering with Kraftmasters they were able to keep us focused on what was important while building the kitchen we've always wanted all on schedule. My wife and I constantly look back at our inspiration picture and are amazed by how similar it looks. 

A few reasons why Kraftmasters stands out from other home renovation companies:
- They do what they say
- They're transparent
- They care about their customers happiness

I would strongly recommend Kraftmasters to anyone tackling a home renovation project."
5,"KraftMaster was a wonderful design-build team to work with.  They handled the pandemic by always keeping us informed and working safely in our home.  They are hands down the cleanest contractors we have ever worked with, and they honestly treated our home as if it was their own.  We'd especially like to thank Carly, Chris, and Matt for helping us through every stage of the project and for being so accommodating and professional!  Our new bathroom is perfect and we couldn't imagine a better end result!"
5,"The bestest of all. Highly recommend this company. Very professional. Top class this Team has very experienced people when it comes to designing, estimating cost and building"
5,"TO BEGIN: Our Kitchen Remodel Is OUTSTANDING & VERY BEAUTIFUL! 

We have a 250 year old house & are very protective of her good & historically appropriate care. Our OLDE small kitchen needed careful modernizing & my husband & I were stumped as to what to do within our small space. 

I began visiting kitchen redesign/ house remodeling businesses to see who I might find. One fall day I stopped into KraftMaster Renovations store front & was met by 3 generations of the Gockeler family. I had no appointment, but they gave me time. They listened & gave me a rare sense of being in good hands & I'd only just met them. I went home & told my husband, “I think I've found the right people for our historic kitchen remodel.” Following our 1st meeting, my husband was fully on board. So we began. 

Design meetings with Bob Gockeler & Maureen Madigan began in our small kitchen. During that first meeting Bob & Maureen moved us to solutions we'd never considered & we were excited. As we worked the design they both took us into & through great buying choices, & great solutions due to good & creative problem solving -- we were a team. 

Demolition began late summer & we were essentially done in December. Every member of their team was TIP TOP & I ALWAYS felt comfortable when they were in our home. I experienced a rarely-felt-in-NJ courtesy from every member of their team & they always left the premises (inside & out) tidy & clean & everyone was a hard worker.

SPECIFICALLY: 
-I met Robbie Geckeler & Matt Carlson with their deliveries & on site work. They were, as I experienced with the entire team, so courteous, friendly & hard working. 
-The carpentry on our project was I believe uniquely challenging and their team was superb. Their Master Carpenter, Chris Stevens was superlative in his care, talent & skill as was his team: Lead Carpenter, Tyler Cornelissen & Apprentice, Cam Kennedy. 
-It was a pleasure to meet & work with Julie Geckeler who managed communications & scheduling. I really liked the online project management tool (CoConstruct). Meetings in their new office & showroom assisted our decisions. I shifted my countertop choice at one such visit, while perusing one of their lovely displays. 
-At the end of our project I met Alexandra Grosser & Bob’s daughter for the photo shoot, true professionals – ALL.  
-I want to cycle back to Bob Geckeler & Maureen Madigan to say Thank You! We couldn’t have done this without you! Your creativity, professionalism, kindness, & hard work were always present. And I must add FUN - This was a FUN PROJECT.

We thank your entire team & your entire family! Everyone who walks into our new kitchen for the first time gasps (literally) & says it’s SO Beautiful - Because it is. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!"
5,"A First Class Company that Exceeded Expectations!

Our family is thrilled with our recent kitchen remodel from KraftMaster Renovations.  Bob and his team transformed our kitchen from closed-off and dated, to the open, modern center of our home.  It has transformed the feel of the entire house.  It is something our family will enjoy and can be very proud of. 

Simply put, the team is world class – knowledgeable, relentlessly hardworking, talented, friendly, respectful, and clean. Kim’s design turned out to be a perfect combination of form and function with small, thoughtful details that add wonderful unique touches.  Her design was brought to life by Peter and Walter whose expert carpentry work served well to highlight the quality of the material, and Bobby whose meticulous and beautiful tilework has thus far received ""Wow"" comments from all that visit.  There were many others that we grew to know over the course of the project – from Robbie and Matt who were key to executing the logistics of the project, to Moon (plumbing) who on multiple occasions, made sure to work around our toddler who was at home on certain days.  

We’d be remiss not to mention Julie – who made certain that we were updated each step of the way.  She communicated nearly each day which kept us informed and comforted that the project was progressing towards a timely completion.   

We are fully satisfied and plan to be repeat customers.  They made certain that the remodel was exactly what we wanted – no detail was too small.  You won’t regret hiring Kraftmaster for your project."
5,"Bob and Team are great!!  I used KraftMaster for my large kitchen remodel project in Summer 2018.  The project took ~2.5 months.  While this company is not the cheapest quote they really do keep to their timeline and professionalism.  Many times contractors will lose interest or start another job and never finish.  Not KraftMaster and even towards the end of the project i never felt like i was a secondary thought to them.  They remained on schedule and finished on time!  They maintained good contact and updates throughout the project.  The main project managers, Peter and Walter, were so courteous and professional.  Would definitely recommend this firm to anyone in the area looking to do a large or small remodel."
5,"The 2 things that come to mind working with Kraftmaster are craftsmanship and professionalism. In the past I’ve worked with contractors that were really good in one of those areas but lacked in the other. 

The team was excellent to work with. Maureen is a true design talent. She took the time to get to know my wife and I to get a better understanding of the aesthetic we were looking for. She guided us through the big picture design comp process, down to the little fixture details. There were a couple of instances where it took some extra prodding on her part to get us to purchase detail that was out of our original scope and budget, but she has a way of explaining how the extra investment would enhance the overall look. Glad we took her advice.

Our lead contractor Chris was a true professional. He was pleasant to work with and highly skilled at the work. He came up with some creative solutions on a couple of items which were initially a concern for us. He made sure to address some of the call outs that I had throughout the build process. The final implementation was excellent.

Julie was very helpful answering questions and making sure information was relayed back to the team. 

Chris and the electrical team were great. Very responsive to some adjustments that needed to be made along the process. 

As the company owner I was pleasantly surprised how involved Bob was throughout. He didn’t sell the project and then disappear. He was communicative during the entire process. When we hit a roadblock on the project, Bob worked with me to find a solution. 

Overall a great time. I recommended them to some good friends who have also started a major remodel project with Kraftmaster."
5,"Bob and team were excellent from Day 1.  We decided to go with Bob's team because of his patience and his one stop shop team.  A large reno like ours can be very intimidating.  We also live in an HOA community, so there are additional rules and guidelines that Bob and team had to become familiar with.  The team had all sorts of excellent design ideas and helped us narrow things down when we got overwhelmed with choices.  The designer,  construction crew, electrician, and everyone else involved were personable, professional and trustworthy.  We love our new kitchen!"
5,"Bob and the KraftMaster team turned our house, built in 1903, into the home we always knew it could be.  The team really helps you through the project from beginning to end.  The design process went smoothly and logistical coordination was quite impressive.  Everything was always there on time and highly organized.  For our primary points of contact I'd like to specifically say a few words about:

Kim was a huge help as the designer for our project.  She took the rough ideas for our layout and flushed them out with better ideas and a smarter use of space.  Especially for our master bath and walk-in closet, which had an odd shaped room due to the dormer.  It was definitely the smartest way to layout the bathroom and optimized my wife's walk in closet.  

When it came to picking out countertops, tile, and fixtures... thank God we had Kim.  It would have taken us a dozen trips and several fights to get to the decisions we made in two.  Kim had great ideas, but also gave us the space we needed to make our own decisions.  It was a good balance.  

Kim was also very responsive to our daily communications and what seemed like a thousand Change Orders.  She was great at answering questions and allaying any concerns that we had.  Overall, Kim was a huge reason our project turned out so great.  

Nick is an amazing craftsman.  He is super knowledgeable with incredible attention to detail.  I really appreciated this.  Our house was built in 1903 and we wanted to match the detailed molding throughout the rest of the house.  I can only image the pain that was.  He was also great at dealing with and suggesting solutions to the ""charm"", aka problems, that these old houses present.  I really couldn't imagine the house turning out better.  It is a work of art.  

Did we hit small bumps in the road?  Sure, but every project does, and those bumps were taken care of quickly.  We are very happy with the project and look forward to spending many years in our home with our family creating memories."
5,"When we purchased our home, we knew that we wanted to renovate the kitchen and family room space to open it up and give it a better flow. We researched several local companies and settled on KraftMaster Renovations. We had an idea of what we were looking to do, but with the help of Bob, Kim, and their team, we were able to realize the dream of our perfect kitchen space. From start to finish, we were kept in the loop about timeline changes, new ideas, and everyone was responsive to our questions and changes. We are so happy with our new kitchen and highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations to anyone we know looking to renovate."
5,"We have worked with Bob and his team on multiple projects.  The first project was a transformative kitchen remodel where not only did the team reimagine the space in ways we would never have thought possible, the ideas they had for finishes and the final design exceeded all of our expectations.  Our latest project was a technical siding replacement of tongue and groove cedar in a 1978 architect designed home and the results again exceeded our expectations.  Bob's onsite crews are skilled and always professional.  Bob himself is incredibly experienced, very open to new ideas with amazing contacts and resources for the most unusual materials. Case in point, the glass backsplash behind the stove.  An original photo taken by my husband, transformed.   If you can imagine it, he can bring it to life!  He also has great rapport with local inspectors and townships which enables the smooth execution of  projects."
5,"When my wife and I decided to renovate our kitchen, bathroom and other parts of our house, we set out to find someone who could capture our style (which is a bit unorthodox), provide high quality craftsmanship and do so within our budget expectations.   KraftMaster Renovations absolutely delivered.  

As my wife and I started the process, we were fortunate that we share a common design aesthetic—sort of a fusion of Mid-Century Modern and European Modern.  We, however, were also aware that this style is not that common in Northern New Jersey.  As we met with other design and build companies, many struggled to grasp the design elements that we sought and often re-directed us to more traditional “lines,” cabinetry, fixtures and colors.  However, after meeting Bob and seeing his portfolio of work, we thought that KraftMaster Renovations would be able to capture the “look” we wanted.

Our confidence was absolutely rewarded.  Maureen, our designer at KraftMaster, did a perfect job fusing our ideas together into a cohesive design that not only is beautiful, but also practical in its layout and space optimization.  Maureen also displayed incredible patience with us (or with me, to be more precise) as we modified some of the original design work after demolition revealed some issues with the house.  

As our project moved into the construction phase, we were exceptionally impressed by the craftsmanship and attention to detail of all the tradesmen.  Nick, Carlos and Camilo, the primary carpenters, are perfectionists.  This is evident in their own work, as well as their expectations of products purchased for the project—rejecting cabinets, tiles, hardware that were not perfect.  Danny, the primary plumber, and Chris, the primary electrician, provided excellent work that was obviously done with care and pride.  

Throughout the entire process, Bob was always involved and always responsive.  Early in the project he proposed alternatives that could save us some money, or told us that certain items were unnecessary expenses.  As the project advanced, he helped provide some creative solutions to structural issues that surfaced during demolition.  As the project was winding down, Bob made sure that we were pleased with everything, and made sure that any final adjustments were done to our satisfaction.  

Based on our experience, we highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations due to its quality of work and level of service.  And if your design preferences are more modern than traditional, you should absolutely meet with KraftMaster Renovations before starting your renovation or remodeling project."
5,"Bob Gockeler, Maureen Madigan and the entire KraftMaster Renovations Team is setting the standard that all contractors and home remodel companies should strive for.  ACCOUNTABILITY/PROFESSIONALISM/DOING THE RIGHT THING/EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE/EXPERTISE & A COMMITMENT TO STICKING TO WHAT WAS AGREED UPON are some of the A+ qualities we received in working with the KraftMaster Team.  Not only are we in love with our full bathroom remodel but we know with complete certainty knowing that the work was completed correctly.  The design concept for the small space was something we could not have envisioned and the end result was even more gorgeous that what we anticipated. One of things that impressed us most is that the team stayed on schedule!!  When I share that fact with friends and family they are blown away. Day 1 of the project they arrived when expected and left as agreed upon through the end of the project.  This is how they were able to standby the time frame we had originally discussed.  We really enjoyed working with the team and look forward to working with them again."
5,"I  highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations.  The toughest part of my kitchen renovation (May/June 2016) was packing up 60+ years of my mom's, grandmother's and my appliances and dishes to make way for the KraftMaster guys to get to work. I moved back into my childhood home after my mom passed away a few years prior to the renovation and was happy I chose Bob, Maureen and their team to turn my mom's kitchen into my own.  In keeping with the style of the mid-century Cape, we expanded the kitchen's storage capacity and enhanced its cottage ambiance with Shaker-style cabinetry finished in Marshmallow Cream. Subtle wood grain porcelain plank floor tiles, a beautiful Cambria Quartz countertop highlighted by a Pumice subway tile backsplash carried my 1941 Cape into the 21st century without sacrificing its mid-century modern footprint and charm.  Everyone who's seen it, can't believe the transformation. From day one, the guys showed up every day to gut, install, tile, drywall and plaster. The exceptionally skilled tilers often stayed late to finish a job.  It was such a pleasure working with designer Maureen, Bob, son Robbie and their team, that I am planning to continue working with them on upcoming jobs as well."
5,I recently had my kitchen and bathroom renovated by KraftMaster.  I'm thrilled with the redo.  Working the Kim (the designer) and Bob was exactly what I was looking for - guidance on various ideas with best practices incorporated.  The work crew obviously care about their work as everything was done with top notch quality.  They were flexible by working around some unique challenges.  Everything was planned well and the work went along smoothly.  KraftMaster was exactly the type of contractor that I was looking for.  Thank you to the entire team.  I love my new spaces.
5,"Having never undergone a major renovation, we were very apprehensive about the entire kitchen renovation process.  However, we can't say enough about Bob Gockeler and his entire team.  Bob and Kim were extremely involved, responsive, and helpful in every aspect of the project, from the design stage, to picking out fixtures, to the final small details that we would never have even thought of. They were beyond patient with all of our questions and went above and beyond to ensure that we were happy and confident in the choices that  were made.  The Crew that worked on the kitchen were professionals in every sense of the word.  Their work was top quality, they were friendly, left the work area clean and were very easy to have around.  The final result was beyond what we had hoped for.  Our kitchen is beautiful!  We would highly recommend working with Kraftmaster Renovations."
1,"Last Fall, my wife and I met with Bob and Kim a few times and our experience was so poor that I want to come back to this, because the overwhelmingly positive reviews on Houzz simply do not capture the complete picture on their business.  Rather than go through a detailed blow by blow of our experience, I think it’s more valuable to Houzz users that I just get to the bottom line.  In our view, Bob is a charming guy who markets a “design/build” offering in which customers end up over paying for the product they end up getting.  An argument could be made that you’re paying to have one stop shop and your hand held.  Having said that, the proposal we got from Bob was so generalized in terms of the design detail, that it was just not useful; if you want a high end product, when it comes to cabinetry and carpentry, it is ALL about the details.  So we decided to go shop.  Immediately, two things became clear.  One, most kitchen design specialists understand that you have to get very detailed in the design, unless you want a fairly pedestrian product.  Two, we would be able to get a much better quality cabinet/finish/overall product/project for, roughly speaking, 20 percent less than what was quoted by Bob.  Now that our project is 97% done, I can tell you by experience, that this is exactly what we achieved…we got a vastly better overall end product for substantially less money…"
5,"Bob, you may not realize this about me, but I am a perfectionist/interior design junkie.  Having been called on one or two occasions by people close to me that “I am a control freak”! (which I do take as a compliment)!!  Details, details, details, it’s my mantra – focusing on how I can manage the “what if’s” in any situation.  It gives me great comfort knowing my actions can affect the outcomes to situations I have control for.  So you can only imagine the amount of TRUST and CONFIDENCE I placed in you and your team!  After doing my due diligence research to assure I was going to get exactly what I had hoped and dreamed for (which happened to be 10 years in the making) – I was placing  “No pressure” on you -- right!!  Well, I can wholeheartedly state – You completely exceeded my expectations!! I feel like I am in a design magazine, every time I enter my kitchen.  It is truly breathtaking and extremely functional!!
Communication – it is a valuable cornerstone of your performance.  You kept us abreast of every situation – and they are bound to occur in a house that is over 50 years old.   Your suggestions for solutions gave us options, which appealed to my sensibilities. 
Your team of professionals were remarkable and it is our privilege to acknowledge them.
Kim’s design ideas along with her education on products and materials, gave us the intelligence to make important decisions.  She is so sweet, a pleasure to work with – I miss coming to the showroom to go over the plan with her.
Andrew’s work ethic is one for the record books!!  His boundless energy and determination to get my kitchen done was his ultimate priority!!  We felt so lucky to be in his infallible hands.  A true craftsman!!
Maynar and his cousin are flooring geniuses!!  Their talent of feathering in the new kitchen hardwood to the dining room is unbelievable.  The stain color is so rich and the steps are gorgeous.  
Robbie, your son, is a wonderful Project Manager.  His attention to detail is phenomenal, his diligence to protect our floors when the appliances arrived surely saved us from catastrophe.  He is a personable young man with great communication skills, apple didn’t fall far from the tree!  
Integrity, Quality, Experience, Reliable, Talented --  these are some of the words that we associate with KraftMaster Renovations.   To those who are embarking on this journey of home renovation, you couldn’t be in more capable hands.  I know you will be truly astonished with their capabilities – we are!!"
5,"Kitchen first and now the Living Room!

After Bob Gockeler and his incredible KraftMaster crew finished work on our Kitchen (see review from October 2015), it was only natural to move on to the living room. We've been busy relaxing in our new space, so it has taken a while to write this review.

Once again, everyone at KraftMaster exceeded expectations (while keeping the project within budget).  From Maureen and Kim's design suggestions and drawings to Robbie Gockeler's (Bob's son) project set-up and support, to the fine craftsmanship and attention to detail by Bob's subcontractors--not to mention our additions to the project--we were totally satisfied.  Can't wait to start work on the upstairs!"
5,"Review of Master Bath Renovation by Kraftmasters

Summary:
Very pleased with both the design and construction of the new master bath.
Kraftmasters was the most creative contractor we spoke with when trying to come up with a design to fit in our fairly difficult space constraints.
The work crew was attentive to our home and made every effort to minimize the disruption.
The workmanship was top notch.
The end result was just what we had hoped for.

Discussion:

We spoke with several contractors about renovating our master bath.  The problem was we had a dressing area with a sink and a closet and a separate bath with another sink, a toilet and a bath tub with shower.  We wanted a separate walk in shower, but the configuration of the rooms made it a real challenge to design a renovation without making undesirable concessions.  Bob and Kim were the only contractor/designers who said they could up with a plan to meet our needs, and they did.  We brainstormed with Bob and Kim and together we came up with a creative design that had a walk-in shower, and separate room for the toilet, a tub, and a reoriented closet with an entrance from the master bedroom rather than the bath.

Kim not only came up with the initial overall design, she provided very helpful input to assist us in making all the detailed design decisions.  Kim went shopping with us (at vendors recommended by Bob) for granite counter tops, floor tile, and bathroom fixtures.  We were able to select our cabinets right in Bob’s showroom in Chatham, and the cabinets are very attractive and well made.

The job was started promptly.  Bob arranged for the construction permit and scheduled the needed inspections.  The first step in the project was to put down protective material in the garage (where the construction material was stored), on the stairs, and in the master bedroom) to minimize the impact of the construction on the areas near the construction.  (It is construction so there is still going to be a considerable amount of dust and dirt, it is unavoidable).

Bob’s work crew were all friendly and knew what they were doing.  Tony, the foreman, did most of the plumbing and the layout of the framing.  He was very attentive to detail and consulted with us when he thought there was a decision to be made.  Yuri did a number of jobs and did them well, but he really showed his talent as the tile installer.  He did a super job installing the tile in the shower, the tile around the tub, and the river pebble floor in the shower.

Towards the end the job took a bit longer than anticipated as Bob had a number of jobs going at the same time and so the crew was not as available to us as they had been when the project was started.  Bob gave us a quote at the start of the project and the quote was only changed for areas that we agreed to.  The total cost of the project was somewhat over our initial budget, but we felt that it was worth the extra cost to get all of what we wanted.

Upon completion, we could not have been more pleased.  The workmanship was top notch, the design works as planned and is very pleasing to us, and all the detailed design decisions came together to create a Master Bath that we thoroughly enjoy."
5,"KraftMaster Renovations is an amazing company and we always enjoy working with them. They are extremely efficient, passionate, and they truly go above and beyond."
5,"Bob Gockeler and his team at KraftMaster Renovations are magicians.  After living in our 30 year old home for 12 years, we decided to undertake a massive master bath/closet renovation. This soon expanded to a new foyer staircase and hardwood floor refinishing. A three month project.  From the very first meeting with Bob's crack design team of Kim and Maureen, we were hooked.  Kim and Maureen were able to translate our conflicting, jumbled list of ideas into a workable plan- suggesting viable alternatives to our non workable ideas and giving rise to new thoughts through their design expertise. Once construction started, Andrew and Igor-  young men who were obviously master craftsmen, far ahead of what their ages would suggest, were on the job. They epitomized professionalism. Tremendously talented and a pleasure to have work in our home. When the time came to finish the hardwood floors and the newly rebuilt staircase in the foyer, Bob revealed his wizard of hard wood-  Eugene. Eugene is a Rembrandt in terms of matching new stain with that first put down 30 years ago.  They blend seamlessly.  Every day, Bob Gockeler was on site, reviewing and inspecting the progress, making sure that the work held up to his very high standards, which far surpassed ours as homeowners. When complete, the team retreated as if they had never been on site- the worksite was clean, all debris removed. Not a day goes by that we don't remark how much we love this new addition.  Thank you Bob."
5,The master bathroom is perfect. Nicole at Wayne Tile was knowledgable and professional. She helped me pick out the perfect carrera marble in one day. Andrew did an amazing job installing it. He is truly talented. We are very happy with the Perrin and Rowe fixtures that Kim helped us to select.
5,"All of the people associated with Kraftmaster are professional and give the utmost care to detail.  No item is too small to be given huge attention.  The utmost care was given to my entire home throughout our renovation.  Everyone was on time and always delivered exactly what they promised.  Every renovation causes an interruption to your normal household flow, this one was almost undetectable thanks to the entire crew.  Great Job Kraftmaster!"
5,"We have been doing business with KraftMaster Renovations/Kitchen Intuitions for several years. They are knowledgeable, efficient and  client-focused.
They are a pleasure to work with, and possess a professionalism that instills confidence.  GlassCrafters, Inc."
5,"My husband, Frank, and I decided it was time to completely remodel our kitchen.  We initially met with two different kitchen/bath designers.  For various reasons we were not satisfied with what they were proposing.  We had passed by Kitchen Intuitions in Chatham, NJ and decided to stop into their shop.  That is when we met owner, Bob Gockeler/KraftMasters Renovations.  We set up an appointment with Bob and his designer Kim to discuss our kitchen remodel.  We immediately knew that their professionalism, enthusiasm and creativity set them apart from the other kitchen companies!

They were extremely thorough in addressing all our kitchen needs.  They accompanied us when we chose the granite and backsplash.  Bob and Maureen made sure that we made the right lighting decisions.  Bob and his entire team always made sure there was a constant line of communication making the whole experience a pleasant one!

Once the demolition occurred they were extremely careful to keep the dust confined to the work area.   Within a very timely fashion, our new kitchen was completed!  The quality of the workmanship was superb!  For the first time after completing a project in our home, we can highly recommend KraftMasters Renovations!"
5,"The KraftMaster team was nothing short of top notch. I would hire them again in a heartbeat. From design thru finish Bob & Kim were professional, on time, on budget, creative, and very user friendly (text, email, etc). I felt that I was informed every step of the way. I was particularly impressed with their attention to detail and willingness to suggest alternatives that might not add to the value. Most contractors try to upsell you on specific items, where I felt like Kraftmaster was a partner in the process. A+ team, would highly recommend their work."
5,"We hired KraftMaster Renovations to design and install a new expanded kitchen in our 125 year-old Victorian home.  They did a wonderful job.  The design process was thorough and detailed.  The installation was quick and professional with outstanding attention to the detail of the moulding and trim.  Selection of granite and tile went so smoothly, I shouldn't have spent the hours on my own at the tile store looking at random tiles.  Our family loves the kitchen, which can now accommodate five sitting at the center island!"
5,"Kraftmaster is an excellent company providing their customers with everything they need to complete their kitchen or bathroom renovations. They are great to work with as well as open to innovative products and ideas which make any project come alive. From traditional elegance to cutting edge contempory, look no further than Kraftmaster Renovations!

From the design phase all the way through final closeout they have one goal in mind which is: "" To give their clients the highest quality job possible""

As an Architect who has worked with Kraftmaster on dozens of projects, I always feel confident that the job is being done in accordance with plans and at a very high level of quality."

5,"We are so thrilled with the way our kitchen turned out.  From the beginning, Bob and his team were very thoughtful, had great suggestions and asked tons of questions to build a kitchen according to the needs of our lifestyle.  The work they did was impeccable and kept us in the loop of when everything was going to be done.  We were nervous because of all the bad stories you hear about renovations, but we had no problems nor delays.  A much better experience than we could have imagined coupled with the end result, made us want to do more including our family room and powder room. We would recommend Kraftmaster for their thoroughness, communication and excellent work.  Thanks Bob and team!"
5,"Our experience with Kraftmaster Renovations has been fantastic. There are many people who own their own company, but Bob Gockeler is much more than an owner - he is a leader, and the people who work for him follow his example. Bob has so much integrity and is a person of his word. That might sound like fluff, but it's not - it's absolutely true. He has an amazing attention to detail, follows through on everything that he says he will do, and makes great suggestions and recommendations without being judgmental or pushy. What's so amazing - because it's so rare - is that he has managed to assemble an entire company of like-minded people, that truly care about the quality of their work.

Everyone who works for this company is great at what they do and is a true professional. If we had to pick 3 things that make Kraftmaster different from everyone else, we'd say: 1) They *genuinely care* about the quality of your project, from beginning to end; 2) Unlike so many construction companies that use subs, they employ their work crews, so you see the same teams of workers throughout your project; 3) Their work crews are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, and put in a full day's work, every day, allowing your project to get done on time. 

We would not hesitate to use Kraftmaster again - in fact, we can't imagine using anyone else."
5,"Bob & Co. did an incredible transformation in our beautiful old 1800’s house with a 1970s era kitchen. Of all the people we interviewed, he was the most straight-forward with budget, deadlines, etc. 

What neither of us anticipated was the previous owners that did the 70s renovation on the kitchen did so without permits (or skill), and because of moisture damages, Bob had the fun job of figuring out how to gut the ENTIRE kitchen down to the dirt and up to the ceiling. I can’t stress enough how diligent and fair he was in figuring out how to achieve this without (completely) breaking the bank. We feel that if we would have chosen any other company, we would have been left in the dust, literally...  

In the process, we turned lemons into lemonade and moved some walls around, added a wet bar, switched the bath and Laundry rooms and he took on all the challenges gloriously! He’s not one to bark orders either while disgruntled workers do his bidding- he gets in there and does some of the work himself, not afraid of getting his hands dirty. He’s also really thoughtful about solving problems and I never saw him lose his cool during the entire process. His design partner Kim also helped us figure out the layout, colors, finishes, etc. and agreed to meet us at showrooms on weekends, nights or whenever we wanted.

Bob also worked really well with our flooring and insulation companies to time everything out and organize what needs to happen and when.

So now we have an incredibly beautiful new kitchen on a solid foundation, a new bathroom, laundry room, and because of removing a wall in another part of the house, a beautiful open concept living room. He even mounted our TV :)

We’ll definitely use Kraftmasters again for our future renovations (watch out 70s master bathroom!) and would highly recommend them to whoever needs a competent, friendly, hard-working-true-to-his-word contractor."
5,"KraftMaster Renovations remodeled our kitchen and did a fabulous job.  We interviewed several companies and Bob was able to give us our dream kitchen.  The KraftMaster team was very professional and neat.  They cleaned up each and every day, which is a major plus!  I would recommend KraftMaster to everyone!"
5,"Let me start by saying that the work that Bob and his team did on my kitchen, bathrooms, and various other rooms is simply beautiful. This is a team of professionals, ( and I stress the word professionals) , that go above and beyond to make sure that your vision comes to fruition. Never, at any time did we hear the words "" can't be done "". This company truly cares about the work they do and it shows. I also must add that during the entire process, every time we reached out to Bob with a question or concern he was always available to talk, which is hugely important while going thru a renovation. I would never under any circumstance consider doing any work in my house without Bob and KraftMaster leading the way!!"
5,"KraftMaster Renovations completed our kitchen renovation and we cannot be more delighted with the outcome.  They were able to open up the area between the kitchen and dining room as well as replacing a window with a French door to the outside to make for a beautiful and  functional space that has a better flow and is overall a big improvement to our quality of life in our house.  

Bob was always sensitive and responsive to any questions or suggestions and his designer, Robin, had the vision that  considered our desires while making sure that the final outcome was functional and lovely!

5,We had our kitchen renovated several years ago and in the process also had all the flooring in our home replaced with a laminate flooring.  The results are fantastic.  I love the new kitchen design layout which included a slight change to the flow through the house.  It's just awesome.  The quality and workmanship is great and was done within our budget.
5,"As the father of a severely mentally and physically handicapped son, we constantly face disappointment. When we required a bathroom to be  customized and build a walk in shower without any barriers, allowing our son to be wheeled directly in, the quotes and contractors we met with were either uninterested, lacked imagination or the credentials. Our last meeting was with Bob. He and his extraordinary crew of craftsmen spent hours discussing, drawing and reviewing the project. Regardless of the unexpected obstacles they faced, they remained steadfast and undeterred in ensuring the project remained on time and on budget. In fact, when a vendor priced a product too low, Kraftmaster kept to their contractual and ethical standards and automatically paid the higher price instead of handcuffing us and making us pay. Their team never missed a day, worked weekends, never left to work on another job and Bob constantly visited to ensure that no stone was left unturned. Furthermore, the bathroom will appeal to those who are non handicapped due to the innovative design and finishing details. No, I am not related to Bob. No, Bob did not pay me or promise to do work no-charge for this recommendation. There is often a disconnect in the construction world between work ethics and morals. Therefore, I wrote this because it doesn't cost a penny to say something nice for an excellent company  especially when it had such an important impact on our son's quality of life. If you don't believe me, visit Bob's site to see our bathroom or ask Bob to see our bathroom and meet our son.

5,"Bob and his team at KraftMaster Renovations did a brilliant job renovating my kitchen.  We went from a boxey dark, old kitchen to an open concept, bright, welcoming and highly functional space.  They listened to our needs and created a design that complements our lifestyle.  Some of my favorite features include a large 6 sided island with microwave drawer and hidden outlets, plenty of work space between the island and the sink/ stove area and great undercounter lighting.   Another highlight was taking down the wall between the kitchen and dining room and putting in a lovely arch which creates definition of the two spaces while giving an open feel to the space.  

Bob took us through his process, set our expectations, and delivered as promised.  Robin was fantastic in assisting with final design choices such as lighting, tile and even paint colors.  We absoutely love our new kitchen and we highly recommend KraftMaster Renovations."
5,I had my kitchen done through KraftMaster Renovations. Bob was great to work with and him and his team did an excellent job remodeling my kitchen. I was very happy with the work they did and they finished the job the same time they promised. I would highly recommend them.
4,"Bob and  his team renovated our master bath about a year ago and they did a fantastic job.  He is a true professional and worked very closely with us to ensure all of our needs were met and he even anticipated our need before we knew it.  He and his team were very respectful throughout the whole process.  I would not hesitate to use him again for our renovation needs.  He is a class act.

5,"KraftMaster was an excellent company to work with.  All of the employees were top notch.  Their attention-to-detail was the best.  From the initial meeting, to placing the order, to all the work that followed, all steps were perfectly executed.  Our kitchen & family room are the envy of many visitors now, thanks to KraftMaster.  You won't find a better company to work with!"
5,"The KraftMaster Team is truly the Dream Team of professionals when it comes to renovations. The project started right on time and throughout the process the team kept us abreast of what is next and what to expect. 

The craftsmen and designers are top notch. With the detail drawings done beautifully and to scale it is easy to envision the end product. The KMR team also came up with excellent ideas to maximized the use and functionality of the space. The KMR team is very patient, and helped us to choose the right materials on multiple shopping trips in perfectly matched colors.

We are very happy with the detailed work, the overall project, and overjoyed with the outcome.   We could not thank KMR more for the fabulous service!"
5,Kraftmaster did an amazing job creating custom beautiful cabinets for my unique layout and optimized the space. The installation was totally pro and whenever small obstacles came up they were all over it and came up with the best solutions. I would highly recommend them!!!
5,"I hired Bob to completely re-do our outdated kitchen. His crew was fantastic and trustworthy, and they produced beautiful work, even providing clever solutions to help us save money. We are planning to hire Bob and KraftMaster for future renovations!"
5,"We did a renovation of the whole main floor over the Summer. It was a pleasure to work with this company. Everything was possible, nothing was too much for them. It was a large project and it took a while but now that everything is done we are so happy! It worked out perfectly! Thanks to Bob, Robin and Andrew for all the hard work, the patience and the optimism."
5,"We got lucky in finding Bob. We were referred to him from another Professional in our area that left their previous job to go and work with KraftMaster. 

We loved the fact that Bob came over to our home to meet with us and be our ""go to"" person in our remodel. Bob knew all of the construction folks and I felt so secure allowing him into our home. 

Bob completely gutted our kitchen, and completely opened it up and gave us more room, bigger windows, and more natural light. 

Bob knew that I needed someone to spearhead the project. I didn't have enough time to spend all day giving direction. I don't know a lot about materials and the like, but I knew what I wanted the kitchen to look like. He even took me along for the shopping for materials. 

I would highly recommend Bob and KraftMaster to anyone seeking a remodel of their home!"
5,"Our dream master bathroom became a reality with thanks to the team at KraftMaster.  After researching countless hours online and meeting multiple contractors , we found KMR was the perfect fit for us. We had lots ideas, limited budget, and wanted to be an integral part of the renovation process. We were seeking a team that would hold our hand every step of the way, had impeccable attention to detail, provided the necessary thought leadership, and had well documented examples of master bathroom transformations, which is initially what lead us to their website.

Kim was very helpful and patient during the design and redesign process, as well as also with our visits to the showrooms and supply houses.  Andrii is not only a master at his construction trade, he is a true professional that is meticulous, friendly, and a very hard worker.  Each day, he would spent extra time for the clean up efforts and educating us on next steps. Robby ensured last minute supplies were delivered and was onsite managing all of our inspections in a friendly and personable fashion.

Bob and his team all possess the qualities that we rarely find in this business -  passionate, meticulous, friendly, neat, clean, best in class craftsmanship, and a trusted partner.  It's now been 3 months since our bathroom was transformed and it still feels as though we are visiting a spa. Our bathroom came out better than we ever could have imagined! Thanks to everyone at KraftMaster Renovations, Pete & Betsy"
5,"We are very happy with the end result of our project with Bob and his team.  We have an older (1920's) home and we knew we were in for a lot of (probably unpleasant) surprises.  Bob was never fazed by anything that came up during the project.  Five layers of ceiling demolished on the first day!  Needing to replace a toilet in the bathroom upstairs that turned out to be from 1935!  A basement full of plumbing in various stages of disintegration!  Not only Bob, but his entire team, were always positive, professional, and excited with the results of their work.  This was our first major renovation project and we are so happy with how it turned out!  His designers Robin and Jessica really helped to guide our choices, although I will say it is always best to have a good idea of what you want from the beginning.  Tony, Adam, and his entire team were also friendly and professional.

Our home has been transformed from a disjointed nightmare (prior addition with ""in-law suite/rental apartment"" had the only usable kitchen) to a floor plan that flows from one end of the ground floor to the other.  All of this was accomplished in keeping with the traditional feel of the house and with a reasonable budget, considering how much was accomplished!  A year ago I couldn't sit in the kitchen and type this review on my laptop and hear the kids if they went to another room--now all I have to do is lean back and I can see them.

We highly recommend Bob and would work with him again!"
5,"Bob and his team did an amazing job designing our new kitchen.  We now have a functional room with plenty of  work space and storage space and it is visually  stunning to boot.  From our initial meeting, through the design process and the installation, Bob, Robin and the rest of the team were easy to work with,  professional and dedicated (working right through Super Storm Sandy) to getting the job done right. Addtionally, the project came in on budget  and there were minimal bumps along the way. We couldn't be happier with the end result."
5,"It is atypical to find a company and owner/operator with the morals, ethics, standards of excellence, creativity and personality that meets or exceeds their representation or quotation. ""Customer service, fairness and peace of mind"" are typically not associated with contractors, let alone most companies. In Bob's case, these are exactly his characteristcs, and those of his workers. As the father of a handicapped son, I required a bathroom remodeling that had to be sophisticated yet practical; I required a crew that was professionally responsible and time-sensitive to the project. Bob is a hands-on, honorable, forthright gentleman. He is not a yes man in the sense of agreeing to anything and everything just to get a job. His input provokes thought and positive results. Unlike other contractors who model after magicians and disappear after the contract is signed, Bob was at the work site each day - morning, afternoon and sometimes evenings. His crew works for him and are craftsmen who take pride in their work and showed up on time each day, including weekends. Bob's contract was professional, specific, detailed and he did not nicke and dime for specific changes that most other contractors would have done so, for they are not interested in building long term relationships and either don't care or understand the value of word of mouth, which can either be a businessman's best friend or worst enemy. Needless to say, the result of the bathroom exceeded my expectations, the contract price did not and Bob is a man of his word and worthy of a phone call when you consider a home improvement project. I know that I will not hesitate to call him again in the future."
5,"I hired Bob to renovate, design, and rebuild my two bathrooms in my home. He did a great, high quality job. He worked with me every step of the way and made me feel very comfortable. Even with no planned budget he kept costs to a very reasonable level. Bob is a good fit if you are looking for high quality work and can accomodate anyones budget, high or low. His designers did a great job on everything."
5,"Kraftmaster Renovations and Bob Gockeler gave me the kitchen I have been dreaming about for years.

 Despite my anal attention to detail and last-minute plan changes, he never made me feel I was out of order in my opinions or proposals. 

He was just as excited as I was every step of the way... and especially with the finished product. His crew was clean, reliable and trustworthy."
5,"Our 50 year old kitchen needed to be gutted and we were looking for a contractor that did both the design work and construction. Once we met with Bob, we didn’t need to look further as his quiet enthusiasm and love for design and construction, customer service, and quality was evident throughout our discussion. Bob listened well to what we wanted, gave us several creative designs, was able to easily adjust as the work progressed and we requested changes. All throughout, he was upfront on costs and options, handled the unforeseen behind the wall structural and plumbing surprises, the two layers of ceilings, the 5 layers of floors, and guided us in making the many decisions on the design and materials. He never took shortcuts when faced with problems to fix, and took the extra time to do the job right.

His work crew was on time, very polite, professional, hard working and cleaned up the work area before leaving each night. Bob stayed on top of all the issues, was always accessible, and was patient in guiding us through the process always keeping our vision in mind. We couldn’t wait to get home each night, and see the progress. We thoroughly enjoyed working with Bob and his crew and are delighted with the great design, attention to detail, high quality work, and the resulting gorgeous, functional kitchen that was beyond our dream. Bob provides a high quality, customer focused service, and we would highly recommend him and his team."
5,"We moved from the city to the suburbs and we knew going in that we wanted to redo the kitchen and open up the living space, as soon as spring came around. Initially, we interviewed a couple architects, but all they wanted to do was to mold the house into their vision and not ours. Then we found Bob and he immediately knew what we wanted to do with the space and more importantly knew our design aesthetic. He came up with a great kitchen design, open floor plan and created the perfect space for us. Given our budget, we had resigned ourselves to semi-custom cabinetry, but Bob came through again. He was able to get us a fully custom kitchen with virtually no change in the budget. We gave Bob yet another challenge, a time challenge. We were expecting our second child and we needed all major construction to be done by time the new baby arrived. Bob came through with flying colors. All major construction was done ahead of schedule. We couldn't have been happier. Not only was the work done
in time, the quality of the work was top notch and the construction crew are professional and courteous.

There are several general contractors we could have gone with, but Bob is special. He is a great combination of an architect, kitchen designer and general contractor. He has a great breadth of knowledge when it comes to home construction and we couldn't have chosen better. We would definitely use him for any future home improvement projects and would highly recommend him to others.

5,"Let me start by simply saying that our Kitchen and other home improvements we had Bob work on are simply ""Amazing"". Bob himself is the perfect gentleman, and he has built a team of phenomenal people around him so that you always have the right expert on the right job. On a number of feature requests we made, Bob went above and beyond to discover people as far away as Indiana that could get the job done perfectly. He listened to all our detailed requests and made each and every one of them happen. Robin, his designer, is truly amazing and again she personally went above and beyond to ensure every little detail was perfect, even giving up substantial time to help us get the right products ordered for a part of the project that was outside her scope. Each and every one of the people that worked on the job were incredibly polite and professional - Andrew being a particular star. 

Just to keep the review real, not everything went completely smooth. To be fair we did add significant work to the job, but the job did take longer than we expected to complete. The difficulty of living in a house that is being renovated is not to be underestimated, but no pain - no gain. Now that we are comfortably in our new kitchen and home, everything was worth it and I can't imagine going through this process without a person like Bob, who was available 24/7 to lead the efforts. Bob is so much more than a contractor, his full service design & build solution is truly the white glove service, the standard which all other service providers should strive to deliver. He told us he would never say no & he didn't. Now that the project is done, he is still readily available to fix any minor issues, he is a man that stands over his work. 

Let me just finish by saying, at his very core, Bob is a good man, a perfectionist who is proud of the work he and his team does, a master of his art."
5,"I had a great experience with Bob! I found Bob after searching the web for Professionals near me. After meeting with a few different professionals Bob seemed the best for me and my project. 

He helped me through the entire process, helping me with each step and was great at explaining everything he was going to do, he even came shopping for ideas with me. I am not originally from the US and Bob was very patient in putting it in terms I would understand and explaining the things while comparing them to the European system for me!

This is our first home and our first remodel. Bob remodeled our bathrooms from the top down, as well as ripped out all of our piping that was very overdue for replacement. He treated everything with the best respect in our new home. 

I highly recommend Bob to anyone needing a great professional."
1,"Do not use this guy.  We paid him $2,000 in August, 2021 to come out and give us a design.  Said would be 2 weeks and would get back to us.  Finally, in November, 2021, he gave us a preliminary design.  We discussed some changes and never heard a word back.  We have called, sent emails, and text messages with no responses.  

$2,000 down the drain with nothing to show for it.  Very poor service.  Do not use him!"
5,Mike was great to work with in designing our pool and outdoor living space.  We had a vision of what we wanted but Mike was able to really bring it to life.  His experience came through in helping us make decisions for a final result that was better than we had imagined.
5,"We are extremely pleased with Mike’s design of our pool and backyard transformation. Mike overcame what we thought insurmountable challenges: trees, slope, line of sight, and dimension obstacles. He created a design that is more beautiful than we imagined and has the recreational features we were dreaming of.  Mike has the experience, expertise, and creativity that you are looking for.  We highly recommend Mike Farley."
5,"Mike is a great pool designer!  We didn't think we could fit everything we wanted in, but Mike made it work.  We only had to request one design change since his original was so good.  Mike discussed in-depth the steps that would happen.  Our nasty muddy backyard has been transformed into a backyard oasis.  We know have a sports pool, hot tub, basketball hoop, and a bbq/Green Egg to cook on. 

Mike truly understands how to take a space and make it into a functional living space. So glad we hired Mike for the biggest purchase of our lives."
5,Mike was great from start of design to finish.  Our pool is a difficult pool due to the grade on our lot but Mike was able to get what we wanted in there and his design is beautiful.  He also stepped in when another pool builder pulled out after 16 months of design and permitting.  Our pool needs to go in first due to the shape and size of our lot.  Mike saved our project!
5,"Backyard transformation. The most critical phase of any project is choosing the right designer/contractor to do the job right the first time. When I  started the process I contacted three contractors and had them send out their designer. It quickly became apparent that the scope and complexity of my project would require a special designer. So I started over and I started researching designers not just the contractors as I had done the first time a round. After several weeks of research I narrowed it down to two designers. Mike Farley was my first call. After speaking with Mike over the phone and answering some of his questions I was confident I had found my designer. I decided I would wait until we met in person to make my final decision. Once I met Mike in person and walked the site of the project, I was 100% confident in his ability and knowledge. This was a totally different experience than I had with the other three designers. I knew I had found my designer and Contractor and we begin the process. The process has been seamless, from the initial design phase through the revisions and the selection process Mike has been there to answer all my questions and also offer his opinion and expertise which has made this a great experience. If you’re looking for a  world class designer look no further Mike Farley is your guy."
5,"We hired Mike to do our backyard design and we were not disappointed! We had gone through several designs with different pool companies but were not drawn to any that we saw. When we hired Mike, he had a unique process of meeting with us first and asking a lot of questions to get to know our vision and figure out our budget first. What he came back with blew us away.  He is unique in that he listens to what you want and will create just that, but add in elements that you may not have thought of. For us it was the handing day bed! Thanks for a beautiful design Mike!  - Ginny B."
5,"Highly recommend Mike for your pool designs.  He is very detail oriented and recommends/designs your outdoor living area to match your needs and intended use:  decking, hot tub, pool, pool type and size, equipment.  Most importantly, Mike was responsive and worked in a timely manner to for design-completion in order to facilitate timely construction.  I greatly appreciate his work as he transformed our backyard to a great outdoor living area.  John"
5,"Very professional on all fronts! 

Claffey Pools plays at the top of the construction game!

Mike F is in his craft is true craftsmen ! 

I would say this was a big decision but in downtown Grapevine I would not have choose anyone else ! 

This is my 2nd pool I have built with Claffey and honestly i just would not go anywhere else!

5,"The design of our swimming pool, outdoor living area and firepit way exceeded our expectations. Mike listened closely to our wants in the very beginning and transformed them into a really beautiful backyard environment! Thank You Mike!"
5,"We can't begin to say what a pleasure it is to work with Mike Farley and have him transform our backyard into the paradise that we were looking for.  The design process that he uses, where he gets to know you and what you are looking for and then turns that into reality is truly amazing!  Mike is a master of listening to you and what your desires are, understanding your budget, and bringing it all together into a remarkable design.   He highlighted pros and cons of different aspects, features and functionality of the pool so that we could make informed decisions.  Mike's process lets you iterate on your design(s) and to ensure you get the pool of your dreams.  Mike was masterful at taking our desires and transforming our blank slate into our resort paradise.  We have already recommended Mike to one of our neighbors and would recommend him to anyone!"
5,Mike did a terrific job throughout the whole process from start of design to completion of construction.  His design ideas to complement the house design and property layout were excellent.  He answered all of our questions and communicated well with the construction crew.  Exceeded our expectations!!
