5,"Perfectly. On time, excellent skills, pricing. Accommodating. Listens, suggests, written estimate. Courteous. This company will be our ""go to"" repairmen/installer/renovator. You cannot find more honest workmen. Call them first!"
5,"They did a great job. They rebuilt my closet, hung curtain rods, fixed a kitchen cabinet and drawers as well as a few other small projects. It was very reasonably priced and done quickly. I would definitely hire again."
1,Very poorly. Owner shows up and says his worker was going to be late. I didn’t want to wait and he says he would go get the worker. They never came back.
5,Al & A.J. are two of the nicest & hardest workers I have ever hired. Will use them again!
5,C and H performed their tasks in an excellent manner very professional they did great work. I really recommend C and H for jobs around the house.
5,"Al and his team have been fantastic in both service and workmanship. We needed a shower replaced in our rental home. He not only provided a number of options, but recommended ways to save money as well. The work project itself, Al made sure if there were any concerns we had, he addressed it promptly. We plan to use C&H for a number of other smaller handyman projects we need done both immediately and any others in the future."
5,"Absolutely outstanding -- your search for a handyperson is over. The team arrived always promptly, did outstanding work, and were extremely kind. They always had professional, creative, and sound solutions to our variety of tasks we needed, and did a great job describing their rationale. Prices were great. We will absolutely have them again for any further work....don't hesitate to work with them."
5,"Al was prompt, and he and his worker, did a nice job. Another party suggested pulling up part of a cement walkway, and this route was not so major."
5,Great! No issues. Small job. They offer other services as well.
5,Showed up on time and completed all requested work professionally and quickly. Have now signed up for bi-weekly services.
5,The installation was done in a timely manner and done well.
5,"The job foreman and cleaning person, Rosa, arrived at the advised time. We went over the work to be done. After all the details were worked out, Rosa went to work. The results met my expectations. All interactions were professional. The work was completed on time. I would definitely use C&H’s services again."
5,The whole experience was great! The team members are extremely professional and we are thankful they showed up to help us.
5,"My relative has been living in the same condo for over 50 years and finally agreed to have the junk acquired hauled away. During this process mold was found in a bedroom and kitchen wall. Al, the owner/manager, had given me a reasonable estimate in the beginning, and after finding the mold, another reasonable estimate was given. All work done was professional and on time. One full bath had a new floor installed and a new toilet installed. One bedroom wall needed new baseboard, installation, and painting. that bedroom needed new carpet installed. One kitchen wall was sanded and painted. Whole condo was deep cleaned. All work was excellent."
1,Not sure if this company is in business. I've not received a return call as yet.
5,"Rosa was prompt, professional, and did a wonderful job!!"
5,"Fantastic! The two people who came really worked hard.....scrub bathroom tile floor, tons of dusting, and cleaning from top to bottom."
5,This was my first general cleaning after my deep cleaning last month. I am very happy with the quality of work performed. A great job. I will be setting up future monthly cleaning with C&H.
5,"Al and his crew do an outstanding job! We have used them for both housecleaning and handyman services. Highly recommend. They have done a spring/deep cleaning which made the house look sparkly clean again, as well well as bi weekly cleaning to keep it maintained. In additon, we needed two doors replaced and they were able to handle this in just a few hours and at a reasonable price."
5,When I moved into my house I was disappointed in the condition it was in. I had Al come and provide a estimate to get it cleaned properly. I was very happy with the work performed. Everything that was cleaned sparkled when it was completed. The quality was better than I expected. The cleaning crew was friendly. Al came and made sure that all the cleaning we had agreed to was completed. Will be scheduling a regular cleaning service with the company.
5,"C & H replied to my request on Angie's List online within minutes. An appointment was scheduled the very next day to give an estimate. The work was completed the day after the estimate within 4 hours. They were on time for both appointments. They were also mindful on saving money wherever possible. The screen on the crawl space was an urgent need to keep out unwanted pests and they got it fixed fast! Very professional and friendly. Thanks, C & H!"
5,I was in need of a cleaning company for my home. I was impressed with the initial deep clean. Needless to say the subsequent cleanings have also been good. Very responsive and reasonable prices.
5,"Very well. They stayed on budget, cleared everything with me before and after each phase, were trustworthy and capable."
5,"I hired C&H for a whole-house deep clean. Scheduling was easy, less than a week. The owner, Al, and his crew have been terrific; thorough, responsive, careful and hard-working, The price was affordable and the place looked great afterwards. I've never used a professional service before C&H. I began with the deep clean as a first step, and was so pleased with the results that I decided to have them back on a regular basis. I look forward to spending less of my free time cleaning. Lucky to have found them, and confidently recommend them to others. Included dusting and/or cleaning: wood floors, coated-concrete floors, cabinet/drawer faces, furniture, doors, bathrooms, mirrors/windows, sills, appliances, etc, etc."
5,"C&H cleaning is a great cleaning company . They did cleaning both my house and office, they have went through all details needed to be cleaned. The’re work shows how professional they are. I asked for additional areas to be done and they were happy to do so. I am very comfortable with this company to work with I have requested them to clean my house byweekly and office weekly. Very happy and satisfied customer that would love to recomed them to anyone is need for cleaning."
5,Fabulous Best cleaning crew I’ve ever had.
5,"It went great. Al and one of his handymen arrived on time, completed the job quickly, cleaned up after the work, and then helped my neighbor with a job he needed done. They split the cost between the two of us, which was very nice!! They have a two hour minimum, and each job took less than half an hour. But, it was worth it to each of us to have the jobs done and done well. My kitchen is nice and bright now!! I would definitely hire Al and his crew again. The cost shown below is my half of the bill."
1,"Terrible. I got a quote of 220-240. It cost 280. That's not the worst. I had the walls repainted and the windows done so those did not need to be done during this cleaning. I cleaned out the refrigerator myself. This house is a 1100 sq foot house with 3 small bedrooms and 2 small baths & a kitchen, living room. 3 bedrooms & living room have wood floors. All they had to do in those rooms is clean the wood floors and wipe down the blinds. The one bathroom had a shower the other a tub. Shouldn't take more than l/2 hours to clean both. I had pre-cleaned the stove so all it needed was wiped out. When I saw the house after 10 hrs (2 people 5 hours each), I couldn't believe how much they didn't do. I discussed how unhappy I was with the person who I guess is their supervisor and he started telling me I was wrong so I told them to get out. I spent the next two hours redoing all the wood floors, cleaned the bathrooms again and cleaned the tile floors in the kitchen and hallway. I have picture of the amount of dirt I got off these floors. They must have been either talking on their cellphones the whole time and talking among themselves because they certainly didn't clean the house. I would never want anyone to hire them. I only included two pictures of the 8 I took of the dirt left on the floor. I also cleaned behind the refrigerator, which they didn't."
5,"Excellent work performed, complete with painting and clean up."
5,"Since we have been using C & H we couldn’t be more happy with our monthly cleaning service. Al has been wonderful and attentive to details, time, communication, and overall professionalism since day one. The cleaners that he has sent to our home have continued to show outstanding performance and we’ve been very happy with the results and cleanliness after each visit. If there is ever a concern Al always takes the time to address the issue and make changes as needed. I highly recommend using C & H for your house cleaning services, we were lucky to have found them!"
5,All went well. Al is very professional and super responsive! He is willing to work until everything is perfect. Will definitely hire again!
5,"We utilized C&H for several handyman projects in a recently purchased condo, as well as a full cleaning in advance of move in. The handyman project including replacing the door moulding, and putting new thresholds and weather stripping on the doors. Well done! The cleaning was done well, with particularly work well done in the kitchen area, to include dishwasher, oven, stove top, and all cupboards and sink. The owner of the company, Al, is a highly customer centric individual, whom only wants the customer to be well served and completely satisfied in the project results. He met me in advance of the projects and totally understood the work to be done. He was early for the four times we met, his crew was on time, he gets his hands dirty, he is a problem solver, and he is there for the end of the job for final inspection. He is a man of high integrity. I recommend C&H for any handyman or cleaning needs you may have. Start with Al!"
5,"After a disappointing job by Molly Maids, I hired C&H to do the job right. Rosa worked her magic and the place sparkles! Al was very responsive when we were setting up the appt and he arrived with Rosa to go over what needed to be done. He also came back at completion and rolled up his sleeves and helped sweep out the garage. Many thanks for your hard work!"
1,I am not impressed. The cleaners did not wipe away the dust around the fireplace or move a small fridge to clean the hardwood floor underneath. The house was completely empty and we were told the job would last 6-7 hours. When my husband returned home at 6 hours he found the cleaners sitting in the car. When I swiped a finger inside the bathroom drawers they came back dirty. Clearly they had not been cleaned or if they had it was not done with a note for detail. So after spending $420 to have the place “professionally” cleaned I will have to take off of work prior to moving in to clean myself. Completely unacceptable. Clearly this was an overpriced superficial clean.
5,"There were three workers for about 5 hours at a cost of $630. They worked non stop and were able to remove a rust stain on the tile in the shower, years of dirt on a heat lamp in the ceiling and many other feats due to negligence. The owner arrived with the team and checked back at noon and at the end of their time always checking their work and making sure they were taking care of the specific things I had requested. It was a great experience and I will now be using them twice a month."
5,"C&H Cleaning & Handyman Services Formally Cristina and Jared's Cleaning I have used C & H Cleaning and Handyman Services for about a year and a half. I highly recommend their services. Originally I hired them to clean my house before a party. While they were at it I had them fix some things around the house. They did such a good job I hired them to clean my mothers house for an event and then I gave my daughter a clean house as a Birthday present using their services. Currently they come every two weeks to clean my house and they do a very great job. Usually I have the same person all of the time, she is very through and efficient. She helps do special little projects, like cleaning and organizing a closet. On occasion when the regular person could not come, Al the owner comes with the replacement to make sure that they know what I like. They also bring their own cleaning supplies. They use something better than BONO on my wood floors. I found they also steam carpets , so I had them steam clean an area rug that was filthy and had really thick pile. It looks great now."
5,"I had 3 cleaners here for an entire day. The house sparkled when they were done. The cleaners checked with me a few times during the day as they finished areas to make sure that I was pleased, and they followed up on any areas that I pointed out to them. After the house cleaning, they cleaned the carpets in the main traffic areas of the house and the master bedroom. The carpets looked great, and it was so convenient to have everything done at the same time. The cleaners worked really hard and Al checked with me at the end of the day to make sure everything was done to my satisfaction."
5,"incredibly easy, affordable, and did great work."
5,"Everything went perfectly. The owner and his employee (I believe her name was Rosa-I apologize I have an awful memory for names) arrived promptly at the appt time. I had 1 worker for 4 hours. They asked me what my priorities were, which I told them were bathroom then kitchen then living areas. I have a bad knee and cannot kneel on the floor to scrub tub or floors. Bathroom sparkled when finished. Kitchen cabinets were wiped down as I requested, baseboards cleaned, floors cleaned. All wooden blinds dusted, as well as furniture, and carpets vaccumed. I was completely happy and satisfied with the work that was done."
5,"I just wanted to let you know that we are very pleased with our cleaning today by Rosa I have tried three other services before. Two of them were flakes and either did not show up or called in sick at the last minute, both times we were expecting company and we didn't have a clean house! Also, one of the cleaners broke an item and didn't even tell us! I discovered it later. The last one came twice with a team of SIX! Both times I had to have them come back to clean things they missed or didn't do well. Not only did Rosa do a better job than the previous cleaners, but a better job than TEAMS of cleaners! She is also very polite and respectful. Thank you Rosa, we will be setting up a regular cleaning each month with you!"
5,We have hired them for regular cleaning
5,"The place sparkled! The cabinets...out and especially inside...looked like new! All they wanted to know from me was whether there was anything more they could do, anything they had overlooked. What could I say? I'm a perfectionist but their work was beyond perfect. In fact, my general contractor, who oversaw the multi-day work, was so impressed with the cleaning company and the owner that he is going to regularly use them on projects he does. When one professional like the work of another one that much, that is a terrific recommendation."
5,"Al called me back at 6 pm at night, just to schedule. He was wonderful to work with. My tenants gave me some issues with scheduling, so we had to change a few times, but he was so easy to work with and changed dates for me. Dominique showed up on time, so happy and full of energy. She was very attentive and gave attention to detail. We will be scheduling with them again! Thank you!"
5,"Several days before the cleaning appointment, Abdul came to our apartment and did an assessment. He carefully wrote detailed notes of what I specifically wanted done. On the day of the cleaning Rosa arrived exactly on time. She worked diligently on each task and did a great job making our apartment sparkle and shine! I appreciate Rosa’s thorough work ethic, her valuable experience in cleaning homes and her friendly personality. I’ll definitely refer this company to my friends and family members and schedule Rosa to clean our apartment on a regular basis."
5,"I spoke with Al on the phone to give him a scope of work needed. He set an appointment to meet at the property to give me a quote, which allowed me to show him specific work ahead of time. We set an appointment for cleaning and the had two housekeepers clean the unit. He also spent some time doing some of the work himself, mainly shining and oiling the wood floors. They did a wonderful job. They did specific cleaning that the pending tenant requested. When they were done, but place just shined, and smelled good too! I would definitely use Al's company again, and HIGHLY recommend it."
4,"Three people plus the supervisor arrived about 1/2 hour late. They were here for about 6 hours. The service charges based on time spent per individual worker. The supervisor, Al, comes and goes to check on the staff. The quality of the cleaning was good and thorough. The amount of time spent by the crew, including lunch and breaks, was probably somewhat longer than needed. After reviewing the completed job, areas that did not meet our requirements were re-cleaned to our satisfaction."
5,"I have used Kristina & Jareds Cleaning three times now to clean up my home before company arrived. They have been very responsive and accommodating in my requests. (I work so my schedule is difficult.) Each of the three cleaners was cheerful and efficient. Their work was very good. After each cleaning, I felt like someone gave me 4 hours of my life back since the rooms were beautifully clean and I could do my own work instead! Worth the money!"
5,"My husband and I have been using Kristina & Jared’s Cleaning Service for about one year. Rosa comes to clean our house every two weeks and we are extremely satisfied with the professional and high quality cleaning work performed by Rosa. She is always punctual, efficient, hard working, and pays meticulous attention to details. Both Rosa & Al (the owner) are very friendly, attentive, flexible, and reliable. We very much value the trusting long term working relationship we have with Al & Rosa and will enthusiastically recommend Kristina & Jared’s Cleaning Service to anyone in San Diego who needs house cleaning service."
5,It went very well until I discovered they had taken $980 in cash from my money box. I simply did not think about moving it as I had told them not to do anything with the cabinet on which I keep it. I contacted the company and he interviewed the cleaners and even brought them to the house to show them where the money had been. They denied having taken it and there was no way I could prove that the money had even been there. The only way to resolve this is to take them to small claims court and that would again be just my word against theirs. So - I WILL NOT be hiring them again.$18
5,"The person arrived right on time. She was friendly and polite. She started right in and we left her alone, we could hear her working away. After 4 hrs. she had finished exactly what we had agreed to. The floors and counters were really clean. We had no complaints. We contacted Al to repeat the service again this month."
4,Very slow. It took her 2-1/2 hour for the master bath only. Then forgot to clean a glass shelf.
5,Friendly professional team that I will invite back help me deep clean the parts of my condo that are hard for me.
5,The servicer was polite and on time. The cleaner was thorough and very friendly. Excellent Job!
5,"they showed up with 4 men and really turned to. great job. the moved, and cleaned under and around every thing, window tracks etc.. great job."
4,OK - could have made somewhat more progress in the hours allotted.
5,"I originally purchased the deal for 1 person for 4hrs, but after talking with AL, I decided to pay for a second person to help Maria and Rosa did a great job! I enjoyed having them in my home. The tile floors and baseboards thru out the entire condo that were so filthy in the beginning looked great after these ladies were finished."
5,"If you want a clean house with people who are consistent and responsible, this is the company for you. They may cost more, but they are more than worth it. Al is great and Rosa is awesome."
5,Wonderful company to work with. Al is very nice and communicative. I was very happy with their attention to detail.
5,"Al and his team of three cleaners arrived right on time. We walked through the rooms they'd be cleaning and discussed particular areas of concern in each (oven, fridge, hard water stains on faucets, etc.). Al also explained that this was a new crew, so they might not be the fastest, but he promised they'd be thorough. Sure enough, they were. Maria, Gina, and Leroy did a phenomenal job -- everything was sparkling clean when they left. They also did some extra things like vacuuming and sweeping the main living room right before they left, and Leroy took out a bunch of trash that we'd piled up as we were packing -- it wasn't even their cleaning trash. The last thing of note was that Maria saw one of my earrings as she was loading their vacuum into their car. She rescued it from the vacuum canister and rushed back to hand it to me. I really can't say enough good things about this experience -- the team was helpful, honest, thoughtful, thorough, and friendly. I would use Kristina and Jared's again, and I would recommend them to anyone."
5,"Rosa got here on time when they said someone would be here. She asked me what I wanted done in the 4 hrs she would be here. I told her the important things that I wanted done, and she did them professionally and great service."
5,"These guys did an impeccable job both times I've hired them. In the ten years that I've hired cleaners not one has done as detailed a cleaning job as these guys. The owner is great, highly communicative, and cares deeply about customer satisfaction and quality work by his team. After these two one time jobs I am definitely going to sign them up for regular cleanings. These guys do a lot of the things that other cleaners cut corners on - things like not dusting baseboards/doorframes, leaving small boxes unmoved where things could be easily cleaned, rugs, closets, etc - but these guys take care of everything the first time every time. Really impressed."
5,Superbly. I am pleased with the professionalism of Kristina and Jareds Cleaning Service and the outstanding service provided.
4,"They did ok. It wasn't a perfect job, but it was a great relief. It had gotten pretty bad around here. We had no cause or an real complaint. The floors were real streaky when they got through. It could have used another clear rinse. We are not complaining really. Price was reasonable. It seemed appropriate. They were on time as much as you could be on time considering the freeway. He works for somebody else."
5,"I have been with K&J Cleaning Service since it's inception when it was formerly ""Kristina and Jared's Cleaning and Handyman Services."" After a somewhat rocky start when it was starting up, I am particularly pleased with the work of Vincent, one of the workers, (and Al, the proprietor/manager). Vince provides that extra ""something"" that is vital in home care (and does it pleasantly and with apparent joy)."
2,"Date of service was postponed several times by agency and when finally somebody came to clean the house did not do a good job. Very light cleaning: didn't dust, didn't washed dishes, bathroom tubs were left with a black circle around the drain, and other basic cleaning things were missed."
3,"I have an 1800 sq foot house. I live alone, My house is clean & neat. I wanted a general cleaning. They asked me what was most important to me, because they could not clean my whole house in the 4 hr window. I said the bathrooms, family room, kitchen were most important. They said they could not do all that in the four hours. So I said the most important things to me was the bathrooms & didn't want them to leave without doing the floors. And that is all they did in 4 hours, the bathrooms & floors. The bathrooms include, a powder room, used only for guests & is neat & clean, the master bath, which is not moldy or dirty, no soap scum build up in shower or on the shower door & the hall bath, used when I have company stay, Then they vacuumed the carpet & washed the kitchen floor & tile floor in the entry & dining area. What they did was excellent. They paid attention to detail. But I've had house cleaners many many times over the years so I know what cleaners do in a 4 hour period of time, as well as what I can do. I was going to check them out to see if I would want them on a regular basis. i was not happy with what they were able to accomplish in that time. I told the gentleman that, He said they don't just go in & wipe up. They do the job to really get things clean. I will say what they did was good work, just very slow. i would not hire them again."
5,They did a fantastic job. Even my mother was impressed.
4,They were very thorough and the 4 hrs I booked were not enough time for the detailed cleaning they did. What was done was great.
5,"The cleaning of the bathrooms far exceeded my expectations. They were much, much cleaner than I had ever managed on my own. The wood floors look great too. I highly recommend the service."
3,"The first time, was good, but the second and third were fair. I'm going to end up going with someone else. I'm sad that the business was sold and is now being run by someone else. The first person that came out was with the original owners, and the last two times where with the new people. I really wish they would charge by the hour because my house doesn't need 4 hours worth of cleaning. Try them for yourself, but I'm being cautious."
5,"Ultimately it went well. The housekeeper arrived right on time and worked very hard to get my house clean in the time allotted. The company was ultimately very professional. The Saturday before my Monday morning cleaning, they called to cancel my service as their cleaner had become unavailable. I politely asked for a refund as I needed the service done that day in advance of arriving guests and my request was going to be granted. They then called back within the hour to say that they'd found another housekeeper to perform the service. I really appreciate that they ultimately honored the appointment. Wish we hadn't had to go through the stress of the cancellation first, though."
5,"They did a very thorough job. The cleaners were on time, friendly and did exactly what I asked them to. After letting my previous house cleaning service lapse a year ago I will be sticking with Kristina and Jareds"
3,"It was just ok. We live in a small condo so 4 hours of work should be plenty of time to clean. I had two small requests, time permitting, to sweep the leaves off the back porch and to fold the clothes I took out of the dryer the night before. I tipped quite well because im aware that this isnt what they normally do. They did do the things, but thet left me a snarky note about it so I decided I would not be using them again."
5,"They did great work and never stopped moving. Very pleasant, very professional"
5,"very well, will rehire for further services"
5,"He was professional, delightful and thoughtful. His only issue was getting stuck in traffic and being late. He stayed until the job was done. As I need more help around the house I will ask for Al again. Thank you! I will be requesting cleaning services soon."
5,"Al is very reasonable and flexible with schedule, fee, and payment options. Rosa has done a wonderful job making our home look beautiful and sparkling every time she visits. I would recommend this company and service to any one."
5,"Al and his entire team were great! James, Rosa G. and Yanette worked very hard for two plus days; scrubbing kitchen surfaces, inside large oven vent hoods, bathrooms, floors and other surfaces until everything was clean. They were very polite and helpful with many extra requests. Al and James even moved furniture from one room to another when asked. Al also made minor repairs. He re-caulked one of my shower stalls and replaced hard to reach light bulbs throughout the house. I liked these folks so much that I hired them to clean my house on a bi-monthly basis. I highly recommend Al and his team to anyone looking for a polite, dependable and hard working household cleaning firm."
5,"Fabulously! My house was tidy, but not sparkling clean. After these professionals got through with it, it looked terrific. Wow! What a wonderful feeling to come home from work and see what they had done."
2,"Was to arrive by 1, came at 1:30, was to be 2 people for 3 bedroom 3 bath but only 1 and they did not leave for 7 hours. I have had dual maids and they cleaned more thoroughly in 4 hours. I missed appointments and I was hungry from missing two meals and exhausted trying to find where to be to not be underfoot. Jared came and put together a bike but barely cleaned and brusquely told me they are strictly a move in move out business. That they do not wash anything and with him trying to clean, I had to ask it constantly point out what needed cleaning but after the confrontation I cleaned alongside them despite recuperating from hospital. The one maid is pleasant but cleans with a lot of crashing noise but is through. Jared should never clean, if it gets past time to arrive, he should have rescheduled. Not that that helps me since he made it clear their company is not as if hiring a maid to clean house tho they are called housecleaners."
5,"It was great. Al and Rosa had my old address, (my fault) but they showed up and were so pleasant and hard working. Rosa is amazing! I am so thankful."
5,The 2 ladies came on time and stayed over to finish an extra task that I had requested.
5,The group of 3 showed up on time and did a good job cleaning our 2br condo. I had wanted to clean the counter tops (tiles with grouts) and cook top thoroughly and they did a great job. The cabinets and drawers were not cleaned but they were honest up front about how much can be done with the 4-hour special.
5,"Dominique was incredible! She was prompt, efficient and made my house look perfect just in time for company to come over!"
5,"Al called me back on Christmas day, and came out the next day with a 3-person crew. They got it all done in one day, cleaning construction dust from every nook and cranny. They did a beautiful job with deep cleaning basically everywhere, working nonstop and actually saving the hardwood floor. They were extremely professional and showed up on time. It was a Christmas miracle! I would recommend them!"
3,"The kitchen was cleaned except baseboards as he used steam cleaner for the floor and did not wash the front of the cabinets. Bathrooms were cleaned except the baseboards and around the toilet and that floor area. I had to ask him to clean the area behind the toilet area, which he did in the front bathroom. Unfortunately, I had to run an errand and left my husband in charge of checking the final rooms."
5,"James was right on time and did a fantastic job. The place looks brand new. He was polite and a gentleman. I would hire this company again with James in a heartbeat. James did a wonderful, way above average job."
5,Amazing!! Very nice and professional.
3,"One person arrived, worked for 4 hours. She was personable and pleasant. Cleaned obvious areas, did not move trash containers, smaller items or dining room chairs to clean under or behind on the floor. Dusted around items on furniture, not moving things to dust under. My high-risk pregnancy daughter was cleaning the next day when I arrived to decorate … moving chairs to dust/mop under the dining room table, cleaning under and behind trash containers and several small pieces on the floor, re-dusting shelves and table tops. Interestingly, I'm filing this review WITHOUT you promptly asking for it … makes me now question if I should use your evaluations of services as accurate. Carol Parham"
5,"wonderful experience, highly recommend if your looking for an efficient cleaning service! Above and beyond expectations! Thank you to Jared, Al and Dominique!"
5,They were very punctual and clean and courteous and explained the installation. Worked very hard and got the job done with an excellent product. We installed 2 windows.
5,"Jared was very professional and did a great job. He goes above and beyond just fixing items, he'll also clean them up and leave everything sparkling new."
5,James was very friendly and listened to what I needed done.
5,Excellent. A lot of deferred work completed on time and in budget. Very professional.
5,"Ryan came to our home to clean our house and did an excellent job! He was punctual and very efficient cleaning everything. Thank you, Michael and Linda Neylan"
5,Excellent - beyond my expectations.
5,The best cleaners in my experience. We have had many cleaning services and private cleaners. We won't be changing. Thanks Pablo and Maria
5,Very well. We have had excellent results using the service for three years now. The cost is a good value and varies depending on the amount of work we have done. We tell them the big items we want done and they send the right number of people to do the job in a reasonable time. They work inside and outside and take on any cleaning job we have given them. We found them on Angie's List and are glad we did.
5,Excellent! Cannot say enough good things about the services provided.
5,Excellent service by Jared and James. They showed up exactly on time and quickly determined what was wanted. They performed a deep cleaning on our home including our windows. The windows are especially difficult because each is double pained and twice the amount of sections compared to standard windows. The house had not had a thorough cleaning in some time and they completely brought it up to speed. Their attitudes were pleasant and comforting. We will continue to use this service on a regular basis. The experience exceeded our expectations.
5,"I have had incredible service from Pablo and Maria. They are such wonderful people and take such great care of our home. We have had them cleaning our house for over 2 years now and they have become like our family. It is such a great feeling to come home to a clean home, and Pablo and Maria work miracles on our house they even go above our expectation by clearing out slow draining sink drains and changing out our toilet seat when we bought a new one without even being asked, it is such a pleasant surprise, they anticipate our needs. We have two little girls and we both work full time, so, our house can get a bit chaotic, it is great to have people we can trust, they help us maintain our sanity. Thank you so much we appreciate everything you do!!"
3,"Not well. They were supposed to be at my house at 10:30 am. At 10:45 am, they called to say they would be late, and were just leaving Poway at that time. I live in East County, so I knew there might be a delay. I would have appreciated a call sooner than 10:45. At 12:20 pm they called again to say they were on the way from El Cajon. At 1:40 pm I decided I had waited long enough, and I knew the job would not be done in time for me to move on to other commitments later in the day."
5,"FANTASTIC!!! I was utterly shocked with how amazing my place looked after the cleaning. It was far beyond my expectations. Kristina and Jared cleaned places I did not even think about. They went so far as to use magic erasers on the walls and polish the hardwood floors. The whole place sparkled. Jared came back for a second time to finish the cleaning, and because they did not have the proper amount of time to finish the job, he came back for a third time free of charge to ensure my place was up to par. Kristina & Jared run an honest, good company and I will definitely be having them back to clean again. Thank you Kristina and Jared!!!"
5,Jared is a real professional. Our home was cleaned perfect. He took the time to know exactly what I wanted done. It's rare to find real professionals in this industry.
5,"After health problems, repairs, and an overly busy work schedule, the house was in serious need of cleaning. I also needed to limit the time to four hours due to costs. Ryan’s focus was set for the kitchen, 2 bathrooms, floors, and dusting as time would allow. My mind is much more at ease now that the house is clean. Ryan was efficient, thorough, and friendly. He is an excellent representative for Kristina & Jared's Cleaning & Handyman Service. My husband and I will be discussing having Ryan provide a regular cleaning service for us moving forward as our finances allow."
5,Jared and his assistant did a wonderful job. Everything looks better than we thought it would. He did an excellent job on the wood cabinets. Tile shines. Grout is white again. We plan on using his service again in the next month. We highly recommend him.
5,Both Jered and Kristina were wonderful. They both were friendly and very professional a well as extremely hard workers. They did a wonderful job and we are so happy too have found them. Highly recommended.
5,"Kristina and Jared are the number 1 housekeeping service that I have ever used in my 30 years of services!! They go beyond what is expected and are consistent each week. In addition, the team is so service oriented; they do not hesitate to do the little things that I generally never notice. I will continue to use them until they retire!! (Hopefully not soon :)"
5,"Jared and his team are punctual, efficient, and detail-oriented. They complete all work as expected. I would recommend them to others."
5,"Showed up on time, very important, and they are very thorough. In addition to housecleaning, I have also asked Jared to perform some handyman type chores, and he has accomplished those easily. Nice to kill two birds with one stone."
5,"Jared and his crew are friendly, professional and do a great job cleaning my home on a bi-weekly basis. And they accommodate any special requests. I have several cats so in addition to having lots of fur to clean up, I insist on being home for any services provided. As I work full time, timing was a problem. I really appreciate that Jared was able to accommodate my late afternoon request. I would definitely recommend them."
5,"Dominique was right on time, cheerful and pleasant. She did all the specific tasks I asked her to (including cleaning the windows inside out, scrubbing a bathroom curtain and dusting the ceiling fans). I just wish she had been more detailed in the kitchen and living room cleanup. Some appliances and lamps were cleaned outside but not inside, and some were forgotten. But overall a good job in 5 hours."
5,"Excellent job. This was my first time using Jared's service. Quick responses to enquiries. Arrived on time for the job, which was performed quickly and efficiently. Cleaned dirt out of areas I knew was there, but frankly I hadn't expected to be noticed/cleaned. After this initial job with great results, I have now scheduled him on a regular basis."
4,I used this service for several months. The cleaning was average. The price flucutaed as well as the crew that arrived biweekly.
5,"I've been with Jared and Kristina's for about a year now, and have been extremely happy with their service. I get regular cleaning every two weeks, and have been impressed with the level of professionalism and the attention to detail that they provide. On occasions that I've made special requests or had any questions or concerns, they have been extremely quick to respond and been accommodating. They manage their business and customer service at a high level. I searched a long time for cleaning service that cleans to my level of 'clean' and that I can trust to be in my house; I've found both with Jared and Kristina. highly recommended!"
2,"According to the listing the cleaner is supposed to know how to clean all kinds of surfaces using their own supplies that are ecologically friendly. When I contacted the lister I described the house including all of the surfaces to be cleaned, i.e., stone, bamboo and rugs. Ray was very nice and very punctual. But it was very awkward since Ray kept asking me what cleaning supplies to use. Huh? Ray cleaned the entire house very quickly. Unfortunately, the corners, baseboards, etc. weren't cleanned. I didn't want to review this service because I could not give it a good review and feel bad about that - but the folks at Angie's List keep sending me emails to do so. So here goes. The reason I am giving this service a D is because Ray thought he was helping by moving the furniture so he could clean under it. He gouged the bamboo floors badly. A house cleaner should have the motto ""First do no damage."" Very nice people but not a very professional job."
5,It was a little more expensive than I thought it was going to be based on the deal listed for 4 hours. They were here way longer than 4 hours but I assumed the deal would still stand. They did a good job on the areas they did clean but I had pointed out a few areas and those were not completed. However they did a great job on things I hadn't pointed out but did need to be cleaned They were very nice and very professional
5,We had used Kristina and Jared before and were quite pleased with the outcome. We needed a pretty deep cleaning of our rental units garage (some mold around a water heater). Jarred was very accommodating with getting it done on my schedule and did another outstanding job. Based on his professionalism and punctuality I would recommend them to all my friends and colleagues.
4,Jared reached out to me to follow up on the services provided.
5,"I was present while the work was done and the team worked carefully and hard, they were great. Two and a half kitchens Four bathrooms Five bedrooms Two ""great"" rooms (open floor plan) Four ceiling fans 28 windows Hardwood, tile and carpeted floors Everything went great. In addition to the cleaning work mentioned, Jared is also an handy man. Two extra charge items not in the price above that he did this time were; 1) Seal the granite counter tops in all three kitchens which needs to be done every 18 months to protect them. 2) The front door on one unit is Cherry wood and had weathered in the sun from the southern exposure. He refinished the outside of the door and it looks great."
5,"Cleaner was a few minutes early, and cleaned the house in record time--3Bed/3Bath 2 story in just over 4 hours"
5,"The first time we used them we were moving out of an apartment we were renting while our home was being remodeled. They stuck to their quoted price even though the job was a little more than they expected. We then had them continue to clean our new home. They were very reasonable and professional, again sticking to their quoted pricing even though we were still in the middle of construction while living in our home and there was constant construction dust in our home. I recommend Kristina and Jarod's cleaning service."
5,"Jared has an excellent team. He and his partners are always on time, professional, and my house sparkles when they're finished cleaning. I have 2 young children with nap schedules that must be worked around. Jared is always easy to get a hold of and flexible. I don't normally take time to write reviews, but I feel the need to write a review on Kristina and Jared's outstanding service. Yesterday, Jared noticed that my shower was developing some nasty black mold. Not only did he clean the shower, but he also RECAULKED completely FREE OF CHARGE!! I've never had a cleaning service go so far above expectations! Thanks Jared and team! I will now use Kristina and Jared for cleaning services and handyman services!"
5,"We couldn't be happier with the result in every way. Very clean, totally dust free and love the cleaning products as it left such a pleasant smell, not the least bit chemical smelling or flowery perfume, just really pleasant not overwhelming. We can't say enough good things about this service!!"
5,"Jared did an outstanding, perfect job as always! Floors looked wonderful as well as everything else. He is very sensitive to the environment and especially used products that did not irritate an ill family member during a long illness. He could not be more helpful, kind and flexible. Everything is done with very high standards of excellence."
2,"While the actual work done by the provider was initially more than satisfactory, there are some details that force me to write a negative review. The man who did the cleaning arrived quite late because he had been given the wrong street name by the company. Apparently this forced him to rush through the cleaning in order to make his next scheduled appointment on time. He did an excellent job of cleaning my home, but he damaged a piece of furniture. I called the company the next day and then e-mailed photos of the damage. I got no initial response, but two weeks later, after I e-mailed the company again, the owner responded. He came today to repair the damage and clean my house, but challenged me about the damage to my furniture, claiming that it couldn't have been done by his employee. Having been accused, essentially, of lying about it, I told him that, if he was going to question my honesty, we were done. At this, he walked out, refusing to make good on his employee's carelessness. When I told him that I would be posting this review, he said he would have it ""buried"" within a week. Don't hire this dishonest company."
5,"Pablo and Maria come every 2 weeks, and we love it when they do. The house is so clean after they come. They arrive exactly when they say they will. They bring all their tools and cleaners and special tricks with them. In 2-4 hours, the 2 of them work so hard and clean the house so well, it sparkles when they are done. Pablo and Maria are a great team and they are very pleasant while they are here. They speak great English and Spanish, so communication is never a problem in either language. We have a dog, which can be a little annoying at times, but they manage him and clean around him while they work. He treats them like family now when they arrive. Anything extra we ask them to do, they are happy to do it. They even clean windows (1 a week) to keep them looking good. Maria makes the bed very beautifully, so the night after they come is like going to bed in a resort! They also change sheets on any bed we leave sheets for. Jared is also very good to work with, taking credit/debit card over the phone and rescheduling if needed. Jared and Kristina are good business owners and very customer focused. We can't say enough good about them. Just hire them!"
5,"We live in a large home with multiple living spaces, and have been using Jared's cleaning service for several months. Our main goto person is Ashley, and she has been great! She is very efficient, and our house is always super-clean after she is done. She is also a great communicator and always gets in touch and communicates any schedule or other changes related to the cleaning in advance. We really like working with her and plan to continue using their service on a regular basis."
5,They did an excellent job. I was very happy with the team that came out and the work done by all of them. Their pricing is very fair and I plan on using them on a regular basis.
5,"Dominique does a terrific job. Bathrooms and kitchen sparkle and the rest of my place is dust & dirt free. When I request a change, she is always willing to work with me. I couldn't be more pleased. She's usually on time and if she is going to be delayed she always calls and let's me know. She is a jewel."
5,"This is my third time using their service. Ray is great. My house isn't a disaster, but he makes everything sparkle. My faucets are shiny, Stains left by a contractor when installing two sinks were removed by him today. I'm happy. I am happy not to have to clean the hardwood floors anymore. The owners are very responsive and the price is fair."
5,"Arrived on time. brought all needed supplies including a steam mop for tile floors which really was different from any other cleaning service I have hired before. It made the house feel alot cleaner. also, got cobwebs from high places. went above and beyond what one just sees. Monique was excellent."
5,"AMAZING!! I was TOTALLY stressing my home going on the market and having a bunch of ""handyman"" things to get done and Krisitna and Jareds Service came to my RESCUE. they sent over Ray who seriously knocked it out of the park. I had several challenging projects and Ray took care of all of them and did a great job! This company is the REAL DEAL - professional, very prompt to respond and do QUALITY work! Very satisfied and WILL DEFINATELY use again!!"
5,"From my initial phone call with Jared to the actual housecleaning service, this company has far excelled over the other housecleaning services I have used~at all levels. After in-depth research on Angie's List on a Sunday, I left a message on this company's voice mail asking them to contact me. To my surprise, within an hour Jared returned my call. During my conversation with him, I explained what had not worked for me with the other two companies I have used in the four years I have lived in San Diego. I felt confident to give this company a try and Jared set an appointment for me for the following Thursday with Ray. When Ray arrived precisely on time that day, we went over what was most important to me and he set to work. When he was done, he showed me the results of his labors and I couldn't have been more pleased. Literally, the bathrooms, kitchen and hardwood floors sparkled! Nothing was missed from baseboards and casings to cabinetry and doors. He is very polite, professional and takes pride in his work. I am now booked for the rest of the year."
5,"I am extraordinarily pleased with the care put into the cleaning -- it was not slap-dash. The old kitchen and bathrooms sparkle. I am completely satisfied. The price was less than I expected. Everyone I met was pleasant, friendly, and competent -- no whining, no judgements."
5,"Excellent service from Ray! He came early (before 6a) just to accommodate my schedule, and got to work right away, even though it was still dark outside! The tile looks fabulous - better than it has ever looked, and the garden wall is sparkling clean. The company beat the estimate I was given by a competitor, and the work was exceptional. Ray is very personable and professional - I will definitely use this company again in the very near future (within a week). Looking forward to more great work from Ray. Thank you!!"
4,There were two people. My interaction with them is always good. They always show up when they say they will. They were a little hard to get hold of a couple of times. I think he uses his cell phone for his business and therefore it was kind of hard to reach him. I don't think I would use them in future until I call them and remind them of some things that they missed. If they resolve that then I would use them again.
5,"Once they arrived they got right down to business. Did a very thorough cleaning of a house that really needed a deep clean. There was lots of dog hair, dirt & dust everywhere but that didn't deter them. We went through the priorities at the beginning and within 5 minutes they were at it. I do feel they are a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. Other less costly services I've used definitely didn't do as good a job with the cleaning. These guys are much more detail oriented than other cleaners I've used. Will definitely use again."
5,"Deep cleaning was required before we started our every-other-week service. The deep cleaning was so thorough that many things that I didn't know could shine were shining when the deep cleaning was completed. Pablo and Maria spent several hours with that deep cleaning and have been doing a great job ever since. Both of us work outside of the home and we like peace of mind with anyone providing us service, especially when working inside our home. We have used other cleaning people in the past and often they seemed to be rushing -- leaving lights on or some cleaning supplies behind, etc. With Pablo and Maria, everything is always in nice order when we get home on cleaning day. Jared, who co-owns the company, has been very helpful with the few questions we had when we started up and was always available to take my calls."
5,They showed up on time and got right to work and did a great job. We will definitely use them again!
5,I hired them through Angie’s List for housecleaning. It’s Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service. I’m happy with them. The cost is $100 each time. Only one cleaner comes to clean for about 4 hours.
5,It took them a long time but that was because the job warranted That amount of time and the house was a complete mess! I am so gratefull for them staying and cleaning as much as they did I can't wait for them to come back and finish the rest of my house... I have been able to upkeep what they did and when they finish they will need to keep coming back as my home is just too big a job for me!
5,"So far, we are very pleased with the job done by Jared. Our bathtub and shower are the cleanest we have ever seen them. He brings his own cleaning products, which are all natural, and they leave the house smelling very good. However, he respects our requests to use certain products on our new furniture, in keeping with the manufacturers recommendations. He seems knowledgeable about the best products for cleaning and recommended a better product for our hardwood floors. We are very happy with Jareds work, and plan to use his services regularly."
5,"My home had sat empty for 3 or 4 months at a time while I was taking care of my Mom back east. for 5 years. It was very dusty. Needed a good cleaning. I appreciate the fact that it was Jared that came and I would prolong an appt. just to get him. He knows what he's doing. He had someone come and do the bathroom while he was here and she was very thorough. The ONLY reason I only checked ""good"" under "" quality "" is because the grout on the bathroom floor sat too long to get it really white again. It needs to be done more than once and not their fault. I would recommend them to anyone and I already did to my son & daughter-in-law. Price was reasonable and fair. Look forward to future business with them."
5,We were looking for long term house cleaners to come out on a regular basis. These folks are too notch. Excellent quality of service - Jared really does a fantastic job in getting the place clean. Super nice and professional. Deservedly the best rated cleaning service on Angie's List.
5,"I contacted Jared with confidence after reading the business reviews on Angie's list. I called on a Sunday expecting to leave a voice message and instead I got Jared live. He explained pricing and what to expect. I scheduled my first appointment knowing I would not be home and left a family member in charge. I've yet to meet Jared- only have spoken to him a few times and left a few task lists. My confidence was well placed! Jared and team have done an excellent job inside my home. They are dependable, efficient with their time and handle my home items with respect and care. Jared charges a fair price and shows when he's suppose to and does what he says he'll do. My home has been well maintained but having a home cleaning service that reliably cleans floors, window blinds, ceiling fans, bathrooms and kitchen floors and floor boards is a treat to myself. In fact it is a gift to myself by giving me a real day off on the weekends. I have become a regularly scheduled client and have my home cleaned twice a month. It feels so good to enter a well cleaned home with results that last for 2 weeks. It's just the break I needed. And because I'm staying with a professional service, there's no concerns about the sister of a friend of a cousin cleaning and telling all my business. Thanks Jared!"
5,"I was extremely pleased with the service I received. Jared and his crew were so thorough and professional. I was surprised that they even cleaned the chandeliers, replaced burned out bulbs, cleaned sky lights areas and even vacuumed inside the refrigerator. My house really needed cleaning because of 3 dogs and just having had hardwood floors installed. The house smelled clean, which is hard to accomplish with 3 dogs in the house. I will be using their services on a regular basis for my housecleaning. Their rates for regular service are very reasonable. I would highly, highly recommend Kristina and Jared's Cleaning and Handyman Service."
5,"It went very well...the team, Carlos, Claudia and a third person (can't remember his name), were there on time and ready to go and the condo looked great when they were done. We also added on some last minute requests and asked them to install a new 220 volt electrical outlet adapter to fit our new washer/dryer unit, and to re-caulk the two full bathrooms for us. They did all of this in under 6 hours, but that's because it included a couple of trips to Home Depot to get the right parts. They were very accommodating through the whole process and completed everything we asked them to do. The deep-cleaning was very thorough and very well-done. We will definitely use this service again in the future."
5,"Carlos and team were early! They worked efficiently, did everything I asked, cleaned inside and out (the windows). They know their work and just executed. They were wonderful to work with."
3,"Found out there's a $100 minimum. I just have a small (studio rental) apt, Last time it was done for $45.(+$5 tip) & took 1 lady 1.5 hrs. (But Smiley Maids refused to repeat the offer, w/a $60 minimum, 2 lady minimum, 2 hr minimum.)"
5,"This is my second review of this company. I continue to be very pleased with the quality of the work performed. We have a dog and two cats. They shed large amounts of hair on the carpet and furniture. Jared gets all the hair vacuumed off the floors, then vacuums the furniture and kitchen chairs. I am amazed at the amount of hair he is able to pick up with his vacuum. He also does a fantastic job cleaning bathrooms, especially giving extra attention to the bathtubs and the tile. We have a recently remodeled bathroom with a new bathtub that had cracked grout along the top edge. It had already begun to grow mold and mildew. Jared surprised me by caulking along the cracked grout lines and cleaning it up so it looked brand new again. He did not charge me for the extra work. Then he did the same thing in an older bathroom and again did not charge me for the extra labor. The bathrooms look great and I am always so pleased with the quality of the work and the attention to detail. I will continue to use Kristina and Jared's Cleaning and Handyman Service bi-monthly. Jared is professional, personable and serious about his work. I am very happy with this company and highly recommend them."
5,"We have had a lot of construction going on including drywall, so we needed a super cleaning with all of the drywall dust. For our first cleaning, Jared sent out a man & woman team. That was a disaster; but Jared cares deeply about keeping a stellar reputation so he personally came out with another man the following week to make things right. Jared says that the former team are no longer with his company. I was pleased with Jared's professionalism."
5,"Jared was very pleasant during the entire phone interview and scheduling. He thought we'd be very pleased with Maria and Pablo, and we were beyond pleased! They are extremely kind and detail oriented. 2100 sq ft home, all tile floors, tile bathrooms and laundry room, and two dogs that never take a break from shedding - most people would have turned and ran, but Maria and Pablo didn't even flinch. We look forward to continuing this relationship with this company and Maria and Pablo!"
5,"Daniel and Jennifer are a wonderful couple and they have done a great job at our place and my Moms. There first trip to our home was about 2 weeks ago, and on there first visit they did a thorough cleaning which took a bit longer (4 hours for our place and 2 hours for my moms). We have dogs and live downtown so dusting is an ongoing problem at my house, by the time they got done our place was shining and lovely, also the cleaning items they use, I think Method does not leave the house smelling like a chemical factory, but instead has a nice clean, almost floral aroma. They came today to do a regular cleaning (2 hours) and again my home smells and looks wonderful. As I mentioned they are a great couple, and they want to make sure you are happy with the service they provide. They also do a great job at my moms, who has Alzheimer's and can sometimes be a challenge to be around. They are both excellent with my mom and just smile and keep answering the same questions over and over again!! I would highly recommend them to any one looking for an excellent cleaning service!!"
5,Jared and Kristina are fantastic. They are extremely organized and are hard working. My house is spotless thanks to them. Not only do they do great work. They are very personable and easy to work with and flexible if anything comes up. I really look forward to the day they come each week
1,My husband and I tried scheduling consultations. They finally returned our call after several attempts. When they did schedule with us they never showed. At first we figured they were busy. The first returned call when finally called was an apology for not returning due to them being out of town with a wedding. We get that life can get in the way. Then he told us he'd call us back to schedule. Never heard from them. We called left a message. You know the rest! I wasted so much time and energy on this. I purposely signed up for Angie's List to look for this service. So disappointed!
5,"I contacted Kristina and Jared's cleaning service about a month ago. I was very impressed with Jared's quick response and got a very good feeling talking to him on the phone. He said they needed to do a 'deep' cleaning the first time they came out. I was a little put out because my home is cleaned on a regular basis and I did not feel that it needed this 'deep' cleaning. He gave me an estimate of $200 which would be 8 hours of cleaning. I decided to proceed with this 'deep' cleaning. When Ashley arrived (10 minutes early) she knew right away that my home would not take 8 hours to 'deep' clean. She got right to work and was done in 5 hours. The company adjusted my estimate accordingly, no questions asked. The second time, Jennifer and Daniel cleaned my home. Once again they came in started work and were very polite. Asking questions on what I wanted done. They left telling me to make sure I let them know what they may have not done and any requests that I may have for next time. I am now scheduled to have my home cleaned bi-weekly."
5,"This is the best cleaning service I have had. They were prompt, had the expertise to see what needed cleaning, and were 100% customer service oriented. I asked about adding the outdoor kitchen and patio area on the first cleaning because we were planning on entertaining. Jared, the owner, and another employee cleaned the area immediately at no cost. Pablo and Maria are my regular cleaners and do a fantastic job with concern about my satisfaction. I give them my highest recommendation which is not typical for me. I can be a little difficult to please. They are the best!"
5,"Jared came by the property and gave me an estimate -- we needed a thorough cleaning of the entire house. They were on time, flexible with instructions, and very customer service oriented. At one point there was a crew of 6 working at the same time, but they got the job done as well as a few unplanned handyman repairs that came up. This company goes above and beyond expectations -- I don't need to look anywhere else. No wonder they were voted Contractor of Year in their category in 2013. It wouldn't surprise me if they repeated it again for this year."
5,"Pablo and Maria were punctual and very thorough. The condo is small but had not been completely cleaned for a while. After they were done, it looked so different. They really cleaned the kitchen, bathroom, the blinds and the fans. The wood floor in the bedroom looked much better after Maria got done with it. They completely cleaned an oven that had become quite dirty. Pablo redid the caulking around the bathtub. It looks great now. I plan to use them again to keep the place looking good."
5,"Pablo and Maria were on time and did a great job. Cleaned home top to bottom in 6 hours. I have 3 flooring types and granite counter tops. House was bright and clean when they finished. Very happy with the results and with Pablo and Maria. Jared returned my initial call within 12 hours and explained the process, pricing and scheduling in detail. Will use this company again.."
5,"Kiki and Ashley can me and spent 3 1/2 hours working with me to deep clean my condo. I have not seen my bathroom and kitchen look this good in years. They were professional, friendly and polite. They were very responsive to my requests and checked with me along the way to make sur I was happy with the service."
5,"contacted Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service as my first cleaning service to ever use. I received an immediate email back with the date available I wanted them to come out for. Jerone Glass arrived several minutes early, was professional, kind and funny. I showed him around my small condo and he got right to work. I left him there several times to run errands. It was their first visit, so, he took his time. I asked him if he could wash the windows, I have two - sometimes 3dogs and they ruin my windows. He not only did a great job on the condo, the windows looked like I left them open! I was so happy! I had to go to work for a couple of hours and left him there to finish and came home to a lovely scented, clean home. I will definitely have this company return. Big plus for me was Jerone and Jared were prior Active Duty Navy, as am I. Jared stayed in close contact with during the visit and was definitely concerned with my satisfaction. I will definitely have them return for regular cleaning."
5,It was a man and his wife that came. They were on time and very thorough.
5,"Our family first used Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service last December. The house was very dirty because it had been more than a year since it had been thoroughly cleaned by a cleaning service. I asked for a deep cleaning and was told it would probably take 5 to 6 hours. Two people came to clean and spent around 4 hours doing the cleaning. After they left, I realized they had missed some places that should have been cleaned and initially felt disappointed. I called and talked to Jared about the problems. He responded immediately by driving over to our house and inspecting the house. He reassured me that he would take care of the next cleaning at no cost to me. I was very impressed by his concern and immediate attention to my complaints. We picked a weekend in January for our next cleaning. Jared came and performed the cleaning himself and did a fabulous job. The cleaning was very thorough and I was really impressed. Jared is also very friendly and personable. I told him I would like to continue having the housecleaning service every two weeks. I am very happy to have Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service as my new permanent housecleaning service provider. They are punctual, professional and friendly. I look forward to a long relationship with this company and know if I have any problems with their services, they will always make it right because of their honesty and integrity."
5,"This is my second review for these guys, and it is simply because I really like their service. We switched about 5 months ago from another housekeeping company to Kristina and Jared, and immediately we saw the difference. We have had them since then on a bi-weekly schedule. We have had different people coming to clean our house from Kristina and Jared, but the last visit was done by Jared and Kiki, and they really made a mark! I have never seen such high professionalism when it comes to cleaning. The house is super clean and fresh. I am very glad we have found them as it is not easy to find a good housekeeping company who knows what 'clean' really means. Thank you guys!!"
5,"Am so incredibly impressed with Maria & Pablo. They were punctual, friendly, professional and did an absolutely incredible job. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend them and definitely plan on using them again. Will make this a regular appointment"
5,"Great. The cleaners are efficient, professional and friendly. They have been patient with my dogs, family traffic and working with my schedule. I have some residual haze from an old cleaner (hubby):) using the wrong product on laminate wood flooring that is gradually going away with each cleaning. They did a great job especially last week when I turned on the whole house fan after the Santa Ana winds, thus sucking in all of the dust. What a mess I made! I have been using this service since April 2014. I feel comfortable with them in my home, and that says a lot."
5,"They're very, very thorough. They cleaned everything and they have excellent attention to what they were doing. They work hard and very diligent with what they're doing so I think it's a fair value of the money. They're very meticulous, very detailed and they get through everything. I have one of these wooden knife holders sitting on the counter and they take every knife out and clean them individually."
5,"It's been about eight months that I have used Kristina and Jared's Cleaning and Handyman Service. They visit about every two weeks. I have been very pleased with their service and their devotion to detail. I was surprised to see a negative review of their service because?for me?not only have they been personable but consistently have done an excellent job and are always open to suggestion (and have needed to phone?only once?when unforeseen events required a change in the arrival for a visit). I would still award their service an ""A."""
5,"Jared sent a couple who work for him, Maria and her husband. I intend to call them again. Attention to my needs and did great job."
3,"I wish I knew. It took me 2-3 days to even schedule them to come out, and then they completely blew me off until I called multiple times with threats of writing bad reviews. I took off the day of work to be home to have this taken care of, so I was really put out. If they really did have a car accident as stated, a business should have a backup plan for allowing ""business as usual"" to continue despite setbacks. Maybe inform your workers the day before instead of an hour before they are supposed to show up, so that if emergencies occur it's not a big deal. Just a thought."
5,"It went very well. I was very pleased with Pablo and Maria. We had some ceiling repair work done so the whole house was very dusty. Don't think my house has ever been this clean. Just wanted to get back with further review. Pablo and Maria came for the 3rd time today and I just love them. If they are an example of all the crews that Kristina and Jered send out you need to check them out. I have had many housekeeping services over the years and they take the cake. There is not a way to give them an A+ but would if I could. They are prompt and so professional. They know how to really clean a home. My family feel so comfortable with them in the house and I will have them come every week for a loooong time!! My puppy dog that normally will bark at a new man walking in the house welcomed him with open paws. Thanks Kristina and Jered for making my life so wonderful. When Pablo and Maria leave, I know I have not thrown my $$ away."
5,They are wonderful! They are very flexible and are careful not to disturb my husband. I really appreciate their exceptional service and would recommend their services to others!
5,"It went great! Jared was completely trustworthy and extremely helpful when we were in a situation where we couldn't get to our home. We knew our smoke detector alarms batteries were bad because we could hear the annoying beeping noise they make through our video alarm system! We needed to find someone we could trust for emergency situations like this to help us out in a bind. We talked to Jared, and he immediately put us at ease and said he'd be happy to help! I was of course nervous giving a stranger a key to our home, but it turns out Jared is now on our trust list! We mailed him the key, along with some batteries, and he took care of our problem as soon as he got the mail. He even called us when he was heading into our place as we requested. We will definitely be doing business with Jared more in the future!! Maybe a paint job next? We shall see, but we will definitely continue building our relationship with Jared and Kristina! I would absolutely recommend them!! Thanks Again!"
5,It was exactly what I was looking for!!!!!!
5,"They were both very nice, professional and listened to my requests. I intend to use their services on an occasional basis and more regularly once I have a monthly budget!"
5,"They're very thorough and willing to work with me on timing. The prices are a little high, but that might be because of the area. I do think I'm getting what I paid for."
5,"We have been using Kristina and Jared's cleaning service for about 8-9 months now. Jared cleans for us twice a month, and always does a wonderful job. I have asked for a few ""extra"" items to be cleaned, and some window screens installed. Jared always cheerfully will help us out with our requests. I trust Jared completely with my home and items. He is very honest and trustworthy. We love Kristina and Jared, and will be keeping them for as long as they are available! Bob and Trish Christiansen"
5,"Jared answered the phone personally, listened carefully and understood the problem, knew that he could not do the job, and gave me a referral to someone he believes can do it. This response and knowledge is valuable enough to me that I wanted to write a review."
5,"We recently hired Kristina and Jared to do a floor-to-ceiling cleanup after having our home remodeled. With plenty of dirt, grime and sawdust everywhere, and me being, admittedly, very picky about cleaning, it wasn't an easy job. Based on the list I gave them, they decided to bring extra help, and they worked away for at least half a day?floors, counters, bathrooms, windows, carpets?I even asked them to clean the tracks of the sliding glass doors. They did everything I asked efficiently, enthusiastically and with a smile. They went out of their way to make sure I was completely satisfied with the job. When I had concerns about some streaks remaining on the windows, they re-did all the windows and glass doors. When I asked about a film that seem to remain on the new flooring, Jared explained to me that he believed this was normal and would take a few cleanings to dissipate. Nonetheless, he re-mopped the floors again for me, just to be sure I was happy (I think they mopped them at least three or four times!) Bottom line is, great job, great attitude, nice people!"
5,"Jamie and Chris came on time and worked for 5 hours and made our house very clean. We just moved into this house and have had a lot of contractors in and out. Also, we were tired of the inconsistency of the quality of the work and the personnel the previous housekeepers we had had for 1,5 years (who have received quite good reviews here). After reading the reviews about Kristina and Jared's housekeeping services, I contacted Jared and got today's cleaning. They are very professional, very courteous, and did an excellent job! I am very glad with the result and I am looking forward to the future services by them."
5,They did it professionally and with a smile. I would highly recommend their service and I plan to use them in the future.
5,"I needed their service to clean a rental unit. Wonderful, wonderful service. The cleaning was perfect and they could not have been more courteous. I will definitely use them again."
5,"Jamie & Jake showed up at the time requested and brought equipment & supplies. They made sure to find out my priorities and my ""dos & don'ts"". They moved furniture and gave the area rug a good, thorough vacuuming. We have a dog & cat so this is extremely important! I explained that the floors (mostly wood & tile) were my pet peeves if not done well. Nothing looks clean if the floors are only half done. Absolutely no complaints. They even got the hard water stains off the granite in the bathroom. Thorough, professional and good humored (an extra bonus) the whole time. Hoping to see them back very soon! (The dog is shedding profusely with all this warm weather.....)."
5,Very satisfied with their work and would recommend them highly.
5,Outstanding work! Came for the second time and we were very happy with the results. My wife was skeptical at first but has been LOVING it. Very reasonably priced. We have a 3/2 1200sq ft home. Both times he arrived promptly which is a big deal to me. Kristina & Jared both followed up with me after the first visit and wanted to ensure that everything went smooth. Well run business that takes pride in service!
5,"Let me preface by saying that I normally never write reviews, but the service provided by Kristina and Jareds went above and beyond all my expectations. They showed up on time and not only were they extremely thorough and reasonable in cost, I have never seen a company that is that professional and personable at the same time. They turned a townhome that looked like a disaster zone from renovations into a model home. Jared and his crew were the most hardworking group of individuals I have met and Kristina is so personable and helpful. I had to reschedule my original cleaning time and they were more than happy to accomodate my request. Furthermore, Jared even returned a couple days later to help me troubleshoot an appliance problem. This is a company that makes me feel proud to be an American. Thnx again guys."
5,"Kristina and Jared are professional, efficient and overall great cleaners! They courteously take the time to listen to my cleaning particulars and then execute those particulars. :-) I have had several cleaners this past year and let all of them go due to their lack of professionalism, tardiness or terrible cleaning jobs. I don't ever want to be without Kristina & Jared as they are not only very on top of their job but are all around helpful, kind and just plan good people that you want to know!"
5,"The service was outstanding. They were absolutely great. They were very thorough, very careful, very nice people, they did a really great and cleaned everything."
5,I would highly recommend Kristina & Jareds company for any type of cleaning job inside the home and/or outside yard clean up. They have a great attitude. Their prices are very reasonable.
5,"Excellent cleaning, responsiveness, and timeliness. I tried to explain the size of my house and that there was recent remodeling dust. They sent a two person team and quickly expanded it to four to complete the job on my schedule even though they stayed until 7 pm. We're looking forward to their return after our move in and unpacking!"
5,Very thorough first time cleaning
5,"They were amazing. Jared and Chris showed up right on time at 10:00am. We walked thru the house and I showed them what I wanted done. They got right to work. I couldn't stay the entire time, but when I got home the house was sparkling! My house had not been cleaned professionally for over 2 years, and I was actually embarassed by how many dust bunnies there were. My hardwood floors were 5-7 shades lighter, all my grout in the bathrooms and kitchen was clean, the shower and tub gleamed. My 36"" stainless steel stove was shiny, the oven cleaned, all the counters clean,clean, clean. Initially they were only able to work to 3pm, as they had another client. I got a call from Jared saying he rescheduled the other client (sorry) because he just couldn't leave the house half done. they stayed til 6pm to finish. I am so pleased with this service. I have signed up for bi-weekly cleaning and look forward to having Chris come clean again. Jared is very pleasant and professional."
5,"So quickly, so completely, and so pleasantly, that I couldn't believe it! I highly reccomend them!!"
5,"Kristina and Jared are great! They cleaned our home in a very thorough and professional manner: dusting, ceiling fans, counter tops and flooring. They have been arriving on time and complete their work very efficiently. The products that they bring and use seem to really work, leaving the rooms with a very fresh scent. We highly recommend this team"
5,Jared and Kristina are very good at listening to your requests and cleaning your home the way you want/need it to be cleaned. I appreciated their willingness to hear my needs and address them.
5,"It went really well! Kristina and Jared spent the whole day completing the cleaning and left the house in spectacular shape. Sinks, dishwasher, blinds, bathtub et al, looked brand new. The move-out inspection went really well and the agent commented on how great the house looked. I couldn't be happier with the results. Thanks!"
5,"We were on a tight schedule to move from our condo in University City, and needed to know that our cleaners would leave the place perfect. Kristina and Jared adjusted their schedule for us after our movers were late, and Kristina and Jared did a spectacular job. We had two large glass enclosures on showers that were perfect when they finished detailing them. We had teak hardwood floors and they cleaned them to perfection. We had granite countertops and they were beautifully cleaned. They took care of details we would not have thought of, and were professional and considerate. We can't recommend them enough!"
5,"PLEASE. DO NOT HIRE KRISTINA AND JARED. We don't want to lose them. They are a delightful couple who have the hardworking, pride-in-doing-a-good-job that one sees too infrequently these days. They are smart, communicative, pay attention to detail and remember and honor special requests with great care. Somehow, they manage to combine these attributes with such an easy-going disposition that, despite our very private natures, we are quite comfortable with them in our home. They consistently make every effort to go above and beyond expectations while even taking moments here and there to interact with our granddaughter and dogs. They are so gracious they're actually amused when our dog attacks their mop. They make every effort to schedule timely service and are super responsive with returning calls/texts. We've had them help with special projects including washing windows, jambs and screens that hadn't been washed in the almost two years since we bought the house, plus who knows how many more years. Clean windows can make a house shine; the windows sparkled when they were done. As an added bonus, it was cute watching them work together on the windows--Kristina on the inside, Jared on the outside, pointing out spots to each other. My husband is 100% disabled combat veteran and we are have our 10-month old granddaughter in our home. Jared is available to help with my ""honey do"" list, which is so incredibly valuable to me. The list is long, so for now we have just worked on prioritizing projects and starting with one thing at a time. I have a lot of remodeling experience and know that Jared has a solid understanding of the work required with each different project. Further, I can see the same pride in doing a good job with regard to his handyman services. So, please. Don't hire them. I really need them. And, I had them first."
5,Great job done
3,This cleaning was ok.
5,"Went well, thanks!"
5,Very well. they were very through.
5,Excellent.
5,It went well.
5,Excellent service provided
5,They were great!
5,Great work. Very professional
5,The two cleaners were excellent.
5,"Kristina and Jared did a deep clean that left my house looking, smelling and feeling pristine. It was also a heroic job as they came in the middle of our unusual heat wave, and I don't have air conditioning. They are the most professional and the nicest, most genuine cleaners I have ever used (in over 30 years in three different countries as well as three different U.S. states!). They take so much pride in their work that you know you are getting your money's worth. I would definitely use them again and would recommend them to friends."
5,They were very professional. Cleaned all of the house including blinds and fan blades. They cleaned inside of cabinets and drawers. The house was very clean when they left.
5,"I really only expected to get an estimate but since it had been a couple weeks (or more) since things were cleaned, the housecleaning was welcomed. Also, as I said, their rate was only slightly higher than I had been paying but their friendliness, professionalism, attention to detail, etc. was well worth it The advantage was having both a woman and man/handyman present so things went much faster and tasks that weren't really ""house cleaning"" were not problematic (an broadens the scope of problems that can be addressed). I realize that we both have a learning curve ahead of us so it will take several visits to learn each others preferences."
5,"Jared and Kristina are an amazing duo. I chose them because we were moving out of our rental and needed both cleaning and handiwork. They came and did a meticulous job getting the house prepared for painting, repairing holes, replacing shelving, and more. They worked diligently and thoroughly. I will certainly use them again!"
5,"Both Kristina and Jared are very nice, personable and professional. They arrived promptly and asked how I wanted things done. They were very open to any suggestions and were very understanding about how our home is set up due to disabled members of our family. Our house had not been cleaned in a long time and they took their time and did a thorough job. Even as they worked, they took the time to come and ask me my preferences on cleaning certain things. I have terrible sinus allergies and many cleaning products give me headaches. Kristina and Jared used non-offensive products and when the shower required a stronger cleaner, they made certain to open windows and turn on the fan for me. They even noticed the high levels of dust and recommended my filters needed to be checked. With my permission, they checked the filters and replaced one that was overdue for a replacement. They also had no problems with my dogs too. I'm VERY satisfied with the job they did and have scheduled them to come back."
5,"Professional, trustworthy, effective, and reliable! Jared and Kristina bring high quality workmanship to housecleaning. They beam with motivation and take great deal of pride in doing high quality work. They have been on time every time and have worked hard from the second they walk through the door. They clean every corner and find things I would have missed ? they even cleaned the AC filters and replaced the battery in a dying smoke alarm. They are fast and they do a fantastic job! I don?t know what kind of cleaning products they use, but my house smells AMAZING when they leave! They are both very sweet and down to earth. A very nice and hardworking couple who seem to genuinely enjoy their work. Although I am a private person, I am very comfortable having them in my home. They are great with animals - I have an cat who is an escape artist and they are impeccable about keeping doors shut and not letting him out. I really appreciate their flexibility. I needed someone who could come in the evening and they were more than happy to arrange evening appointments ? a huge plus!"
5,"Kristina and Jared were able to schedule their services to meet my needs and showed up on time and worked completely to my satisfaction to get my rental home ready for the new tenants. Jared pulled nails out of the walls, patched sanded and did touch up painting in all the rooms. Kristina started by tackling the kitchen and all the appliances. They hung the freshly cleaned draperies and repaired the traveler mechanism. Windows sparkled inside and out when they were painstakingly washed. Both bathrooms were scrubbed and sanitized. Nothing was left in the corners. Custom cabinetry was thoroughly vacuumed, cleaned, and polished. Tile flooring was swept, then vacuumed and then mopped. Kristina and Jared accomplish in a full day what would have take others much longer to accomplish. They are a very pleasant young couple with admirable work ethic and high standards. They ensured that I was satisfied with all that they accomplished. I would not hesitate to use them again and recommend them to others."
5,"For many years I had one of my best friends clean my apartment. She?s a perfectionist and, although I knew I was lucky to have her, it wasn?t until she moved away that I realized how lucky I was. I?ve tried several cleaning services in the past few years. Lazy and apathetic describes most of the people coming to clean. Although some have been very nice and respectful, if you?re not a good cleaner willing to work hard and fast, what?s the point? Now, thanks to Angie?s List, I?ve found Karen and Jared. They showed up on time. They?re easy to talk to and hard working. It?s obvious they?re passionate about their job, showing an attention to detail as if they were cleaning their own apartment. With other services, I was surprised to find one thing after another missed or not done right after they were done and gone. Not with Karen and Jared. There work was perfect and I?ll be using them from now on. Thanks, Angie?s List."
5,"Kristina and Jered did a phenomenal job. We've used two cleaning services in the past before using Kristina and Jered including one that was highly rated with Angie's List who won one of those Band of Neighbor awards and ""Award of Excellence"". We got a deep cleaning and one routine cleaning through this service. While the deep cleaning was fine, the routine cleaning was not up to par. We live in a two-story house and the kitchen was not clean. Floors were still dirty. It was a mess. We did not get very good customer service through that group despite my trying for two weeks and given them the benefit of the doubt. That is when I found Kristina and Jered again through Angie's List and they have exceeded our expectations. We are very pleased with them and they were better than the cleaning service that won those awards. They are professional and courteous and pay attention to detail and want to make sure that expectations are met. They are so much better than the prior cleaning service that won all those awards and was recognized by Angies List. I would highly recommend them."
5,"After having a deep clean of our home, we asked Kristina and Jared to schedule regular cleanings. They are a delightful, personable young couple who work really well together. We instantly felt at home with them. They are professional, punctual, courteous, hard workers and self starters! We feel very comfortable leaving our home to them. Their attention to detail is incredible! Their work leaves things not just clean, but sparkling. I have been amazed with what they have done! When the windows were done, it looked as if the panes had been removed, they were so clean! They always go above and beyond what would be expected. For example, one day I had just unloaded the drier and clean clothes were on the bed. When we returned from the doctor appt., the clothes were neatly folded. Having a seriously ill person in the home has brought out their kindness and consideration as well. It is obvious they are very caring and thoughtful. The use of green products has been very helpful and leaves such a nice smell. In addition to the outstanding housekeeping, Jared is also a handyman and has noticed and offered to repair things: caulking in the bathroom, repairing a skylight, clearing off leaves and twigs off our flat roof. Everything Kristina and Jared have done has been outstanding and amazing! We have tried two other housecleaning services previously which we thought were acceptable at the time, but there is no comparison to the work Kristina and Jared have done! They truly are a godsend to us!"
5,"We actually enjoyed having Jared and Kristina come to our apartment. They were extremely pleasant to be around, and they worked very well together. They pointed out areas where we needed to call in the landlord for some repairs, such as a leaking/running toilet, and were very helpful in giving us some solutions to some of our ongoing issues. When it turned out that they would be late for our appointment, they kept in touch with us so we would know when to expect them, and they finished within the four-hour time period that we had been quoted. Thanks so much, Jared and Kristina!"
5,"Fantastic. Kristina and Jared were very friendly and flexible on the phone in discussing what we were looking for in a cleaning service for my parents house. We scheduled a day and time within a few days. They showed up on time and just were just as friendly and flexible in person. They asked what we wanted done, made some recommendations and got to work. They worked quickly but didn't hurry, and took care that everything was sparkling clean and put back into place. Their work is great, they're easy to work with, and we couldn't be more pleased. We scheduled regular cleaning before they left."
5,They were very conscientious and treated the project as if they were painting and fixing their own home. They worked tirelessly until the job was done!
5,"I have been using Kristina and Jared for several months and am very pleased with their service. They are timely and will text or call if they are running early or late. They are friendly and efficient and seem very detail oriented. They are accommodating to our partially remodeled home (newer half much easier to clean than older half). I have tried many services and individual housekeepers over the years and am very comfortable with them in my home and have no concerns having them here while I'm away. I am interested in my house being truly clean - behind doors, behind furnishings (occasionally obviously), dusted ceiling corners, etc. I like having Kristina and Jared because they understand I would rather pay for a little more time and have them do a little deeper cleaning rather than a superficial dusting with carefully folded towels."
5,"Kristina and Jared arrived on time, asked specific questions about how I wanted things done and finished within the projected time. They provided great attention to detail and did an excellent job. They even went above and beyond on little things, like putting my dirty sheets in the washer and dryer before they left. I was very comfortable leaving them alone in my home and would recommend them highly, without reservation!"
5,Perfect outcome.
5,It went well.
5,They did a good job.
5,Their work was excellent.
5,see above
5,See above review box.
4,"We were referred to Doug Canada by a friend for whom he had made and installed custom cabinets/drop zone near their kitchen. We were pleased with Doug's thorough and professional manner. He was very amenable to working with our special requests. As for the carpentry portion of it, I couldn't be happier. Considering the age of house and the level of difficulty, I was very impressed with Doug's skill. The door was properly hung and closes in perfect alignment. The weather stripping, threshold, exterior and interior trim are flawless. We did some staining ourselves because we wanted to use two different colors to highlight the carving, but the contractor finished the interior side, the second coat and the polyurethane sealer. There were some surprises on the job; for example, the contractor had to remove a row of brick header in order for the door to fit (for some reason the opening is shorter than the standard). Later, we had a minor delay and misunderstanding over the staining: who was going to do what and whether or not the original quote would cover the labor cost. However, the issue was handled with honesty and professionalism and we were able to work it out to both our satisfaction. The only reason I am not giving the job an excellent rating is because I had to touch up some of the stain and poly each night, plus scrape the windows. Ideally, the job could have been a little bit neater. However, we were still more than satisfied with the overall performance and the price/value. We would definitely recommend this contractor."
5,Arrived at the specified time and completed changing my shower heads expeditiously! He has completed other jobs for me as well.
2,Vic was nice enough when he did the job but there’s a gap in one transition and on another the adhesive didn’t work. Touch ups were scheduled and blown off numerous times and now i cannot get a response
1,Vic abandoned the project after payment was made. Would not recommend as a contractor.
5,"Victor was professional and dependable. He provided excellent communications, fast response and timely service. He was very easy to work with"
1,Owner Victor Womack took my deposit and never performed the work. He has not returned my calls or texts messages. Had to file a civil case against him and his company.
5,"Fantastic! Quick and clear communication from the start. Showed up on time, explained the work that was needed, and worked efficiently. Very professional and courteous. Would definitely contact Prop Flipper for future work needed."
5,The job went very well. He was very thorough and paid attention to details during the job. I was very satisfied.
5,He solved my problems in a jiffy. Great knowledgable worker. Thanks
5,Excellent! Vic was awesome and very professional. Definitely will hire again and refer to friends and family
5,amazing service!
5,It was good. They were affordable. Everyone was professional.
5,Great work
5,"It was very good, and done in a timely manner! The pricing was uncomparible, and so professional! He cleaned up very good behind himself"
4,Very well..remodel turned out nice. I’m satisfied.
5,"He was very professional, meticulous and cleaned up after, which I appreciated because I’ve had some contractors in to do work and had to clean up their messes. He also took the time to explain the process to me before starting."
5,"Vic was great, he’s very professional and completed work in a timely fashion. He called back days later to make sure everything was still working fine and I invited him back out to do more work. Good help is hard to find so I will be keeping Vic on sped dial for future project!"
5,Excellent!! Fast and friendly.
2,"Did not go well. Oscar was very disrespectful on phone and in person, in more than one conversations. He also added $150 after originally quoting me. In the end, he completed the project, but refused to send me pictures. I was out of town and had to send someone else to take pictures of completed work to send to HOA. I paid $50 less than others, but I guess you get what you pay for. I would rather work with someone who takes more money but is professional and courteous. I do not recommend Oscar's company."
1,Horrible he gave me a price on Saturday then came to do the job on Wednesday and renegotiate the price because of materials then tried to use old rotten wood I told him to leave
3,"They did a fair job. However, I will continue my search for my next handyman job."
5,"Oscar and his contractors were prompt, they completed the job to satisfaction and left a clean workspace. They repaired/replaced trim in all of the entryways on my main level. They also installed a storm door to my front door. They were very careful in their work. I would certainly hire them to do more work in my home."
5,Perfect! A dream come true. Installed the side door to the back of house. Now I look out over my yard with joy and admiration. During this change Oscar and his team insulated the entire side of house. OMG the room is so much warmer. Thanks a million! from Arneda B.
5,"Very good quality of work. Great crew, punctual and he was an honest guy."
5,"I had him do a work at my house, and he did a very good job. Very professional and a very nice person to work with. I would totally recommend him and would call him again if I need more work to be done."
5,Perfect! Very professional and precise. Cleaned up and presented the deck I dreamed of. On schedule too. Thanks again
5,It went very good although I had to wait for the replacement several months due to an erroneous delivery of window. Otherwise the work was excellent!
5,"Oscar. Does good work at a reasonable price. He has done small handyman work and large improvements and renovations. Will hire him agai,n."
5,"Very well, especially in bad conditions."
5,Frank was on time and professional. He had the job done in less than an hour. Excellent job well done. Anne went out of her way to remain in contact until my job was scheduled. She provided great and quick service. Thank you so much.
5,"I had a problem on garage sinking at the back, he was able raise the roof a bit and was able to change the board and while doing the replacement of the boards he saw chipmunks nest in side the wall, so he put a reinforced 6 inch wide backboard on the base to keep the chipmunks from coming back. And on the Back Porch, he installed new strom door on and put a new light as well, he also stained the porch and the picnic table and it was excellent, he did everything I wanted him to do and and he did it well."
5,He does a good job and I highly recommend him to everybody
1,I requested a quote from them 2 times. There has been absolutely no response. Nothing to indicate that they would or could do the job. If they called today I would not hire them. NO RESPONSE.
1,"Called 3 times, receptionist was very nice, but no one would ever get back to me. They won’t come out to look at a job, you have to email them pictures hoping someone will get back to you. I waited a week and no one ever got back to me."
5,Did everything I need and done it quickly. Reasonable price. They work fast and do a great job. I get the same guy every time. Great with details.
5,We're happy with the service and we've been using them for years now.
5,"Very good. Chris was punctual, friendly and professional ! We will have him back for future projects"
2,Never showed up to estimate or return calls
5,excellent. I had used them for years.
5,They helped me out in a pinch. Husband had a hip replacement and we realized we did not have the proper stair railings to help him go up and down the stairs. They came out quickly and installed the extra railings we needed. Matched the new railings shape to the existing railings and cleaned up afterwards
2,"The initial visit was fine: I had a good vibe that the man who visited to assess the job was knowledgeable and trustworthy. He said he didn't know they were still doing this kind of work but would take it back to the shop and someone would contact me with pricing and timing. After 5 days I recalled the number, spoke to a woman and told her I'd gotten no response. She said she'd contact Mr. Handyman and have someone call me. I never got a call either pricing or refusing the job. I rated them a B on punctuality because of the initial contact and a D on professionalism because no one ever followed up. I understand the job may have been something they didn't want to do, that's fine. But, if they can't even call a prospect to refuse the job (their right to do so) why would I ever call them again to become a customer?"
5,The person did an excellent job on the walls. You can no longer tell they were separated.
5,"I received a phone call from their office telling me that my handyman was picking up some materials for the job and would be a few minutes late. He was, literally, only a few minutes late. He wasted no time setting up his equipment and immediately went to work. The quality of his work was excellent. Halfway through this project I asked him to do some additional work installing a French Cleat system in my basement work area. He agreed, but indicated that he would have to go pick up some more material. That trip took very little time and he returned and finished the job expeditiously. The whole project was completed within their original time estimates (including the additional French Cleat system) and the only differential in cost was for the additional materials. We were very pleased with Mr. Handyman and we are thinking of several more projects he can do in the future."
5,"Mr Handyman was prompt, professional and neat. Jim showed up, assessed the situation and made the necessary repairs and cleaned up. I have 2 more projects and I will not hesitate to contact Mr Handyman in the future."
5,"All of the techs that were sent for the variety of jobs we were having done were very professional, did very good quality work, solved some challenges with our old house that required creative solutions, were very quick to start work, communicated very well throughout the project. We had a great experience with the team and will definitely hire them again for future projects."
5,"Great, on time, very courteous. Hardly knew they were here until they showed me the well finished project."
5,The repair man was on time courteous and professional . The work was completed quickly and properly. He made suggestions that made the project better. He cleaned up afterwards .
5,"Very well. Barbara was a wonderful receptionist and took all my many messages and took all the details down and shared them with the workers. Excellent communication was handled with all involved. Also, James was the worker who came out and he did an excellent job. I was so pleased that he knew immediately that the cupboard doors could be moved up so they would open after a refrigerator had been put in. Plus he fixed our swinging door so it would work next time better, when we need to take it off. He tried it out once to make sure it would work. I was very pleased with both people I worked with from this company and would highly recommend."
5,"I am always pleased with their work. Thus, I continue to call them for other small tasks that I cannot do. The communication with Mr. Handyman is very good regarding scheduling, any delays, and desired specifics about how you want the job done (or any needed hardware)."
5,He fixed our patio door that got pushed off its track and showed me what to do if it happened again. Would definitely use them again.
5,Terrific from the price quoting phase to the final installation including providing insurance documentation and W-9.
5,It went well. The technicican showed up in the morning. I let him in. He was done and sent me my bill by noon. The work was well done and clean
5,"Mr. Handyman is an awesome service for so many reasons. I'm sure different people use it for different reasons, but personally, I'm a small business owner who is renovating a house, and it's a lot to manage without help. Prioritizing things like small repairs and assembling furniture is extremely difficult for me, and it's so valuable to have a resource like Mr. Handyman who I know will come to my home exactly when they say they will and just get it done right. It's really different from hiring your run-of-the-mill contractor because you know exactly who you're getting, and they have a repeatable methodology for customer service and project execution. You will never experience a late handyman, a lack of professionalism, or a job poorly done--it's just not how they do things. They're also really transparent about quoting and billing, so you know exactly what you'll pay.I know that any of their staff would be knowledgeable and skilled, so you're safe with anyone. I do have to mention, though, that I am so thankful to have found Dan. He is an excellent handyman and person. I have been so absolutely happy with his service, he does everything beautifully and goes way out of his way to make sure everything is done the way I want it. He is professional, considerate, and makes it clear that his main concern is making sure I'm satisfied, plus I'm pretty sure there's nothing he can't do."
5,"Nice job ! , very pleased . Nick was the installer , very nice , organized , cleaned as worked , and made sure he looked over the area not to leave any debris ."
5,"It went great. They did it while I was at work and I always get a little nervous when I'm not there to clarify any questions the contractors might have. However, they did everything perfectly and I feel they even went above and beyond my request in getting the vinyl siding nailed down and secure."
5,Very quick to come and give estimate and quick to complete the project.
5,It was great. They responded to my inquiry the same day and sent a technician out the following day to quote the project. I accepted the quote on Friday and he did the work on Monday. Jon was polite and worked efficiently and cleaned up after the job was done. The final cost was well within the quoted price.
5,everything was done promptly and under the estimate
5,Its under new management and its even better than it used to be.
5,"In each project, I found Mr. Handyman to be reasonable priced and their technician Jim was very professional. I am pleased with the overall result of each project and would definitely use them again in the future"
5,Good job prompt and took no time at all
5,"Trying to find a contractor to do small jobs can be a real challenge. This company has outstanding responsiveness, completed the job quickly and does excellent work. Hence, A's in all categories."
5,On time and we're very professional
2,No work was performed since no one contacted me.
5,"The technician (James) was personable, knowledgeable, and aimed for perfection in his work. All aspects of the job were completed at a high level of quality -- the replacement fascia boards above my front door were especially challenging and were done perfectly. I was also impressed with the speed at which the work was executed. The communications from the home office were also excellent and helped to keep me informed throughout the process. I'm glad to have found a reliable option for this type of work in the future -- finding a good contractor is always a challenge."
5,Excellent. He was really nice and he did a good job. He put a tarp down. Very good. They did the job the same day they came out to give me an estimate. They were right on time. He was very good. Definitely use again.
4,"The work got done, though it was completed by someone with little experience in these areas. They did come back and fix the problems I noticed, so in the end it was ok."
5,Wonderful! Technician Nick came out and repaired my deck and did an excellent job and was done in 2 hours and it was very affordable
5,"He did some work, a couple of jobs for me, about an year ago. I was fine with him. Two was a little bathroom window. One is a bay window. Three separate windows. They must have misunderstand me, and we got it straighten out. So, they replaced the two windows in the middle, and as they were doing the work outside, they called me outside one day, and wanted to show me something. If I had only had an window company come in, and changed the windows, I probably would have not had happened. When they started pulling off the trim of the window, they noticed in the bay, the insulation pretty much was gone. So, I told them to go ahead and do the work. They pull off everything else, and my house has been cold a long time, but there was virtually no insulation in there. So, they found it, and with my permission, they padded up all,sealed it all up with insulation, and did wood trim on the outside, and they did a great job."
5,"I had a handle where the lock part wasn't working anymore. I didn't like the handle to begin with. I asked if they was going to be time to repair that if it was going to be possible to replace all that and I tried to specify what kind of handle I really wanted, not the original one that came with the door. I was very happy. That's all I can say. Now I don't pinch myself I open the screen door. I never have them come out for just one item. I want to say it was a paint job. These are really simple jobs. Touch up jobs inside."
5,"Have used before. They do good work. Usually they charge by the hour and then I pay for the part they had to buy. It's usually a set rate. They couldn't get me just the deadbolt alone. We had to get the set with the deadbolt with the handle. My daughter said something the other day, said she couldn't get it open very well. I'm watching to see if that's going to be a problem. I try to make sure I have enough things for them to do for the whole hour so you get your money's worth."
5,They are down in my book as the people I turn to because I've been happy with their services all the time.
4,"The price seems pretty fair. On bigger jobs they send two people but most times just one. I've had a pretty good experience, they've done a lot better then the people I used before."
5,"very well, they were extremely professional, showed up on time and were done before i knew it. didn't think it would make that much of a difference, but now im almost too hot, so i took my shirt off"
5,"Dan was the technician and he was so friendly and clearly knew what he was doing. My fencing had some damage and I was worried about my dogs getting out, Mr. Handyman made an appointment promptly and Dan arrived on time and finished quickly. Not only did he fix my fencing, but when he was done he fixed other areas of my fencing that needed some work! This puts my mind at ease with my dogs and I am so happy I chose Mr. Handyman. Thank you for your quick and above and beyond work!"
5,"Great service with Nick and Mr Handyman. He arrived right on-time, was professional, polite and did a great job. Completed all of my projects (including fan assembly and removal) very quickly and without issue. Will absolutely be hiring them again."
5,"I am a Dan fan...big time! He works really fast, cleans up, eager to help and do a job right. He seems to ask himself how he could do a job differently to save me money. Dan the Handyman is a great help to me."
2,"Three business days before my scheduled appointment of June 21, 2016 they called and cancelled. Jim from Mr. Handyman gave no reason other than they couldn't do it at this time. I had a door jamb that was broke and the door was not lockable so I pleaded for them to please just do that one for safety. He agreed and sent someone over on June 21, 2106. they had given me an estimate $457.00 and 4 hours to replace/repair the jamb and $50 in materials. The worker arrived at 12:45 and left at 2:45 and left for 1/2 hour during that time to get material he had forgot. They charged me the $457.00. I spoke to Mike at Mr. Handyman on July 13th at 10:00 a.m. to discuss why they had not called me to schedule the work on the other two doors. He said Jim had said I cancelled the other two jobs, which I did not. At that time I discussed the cost of the door jamb with labor at $200 per hour (one man). He said the labor includes costs for the time it takes to get to the job as well as the time it took him to come out and do an estimate of the job several weeks earlier. I let him know that this does not seem appropriate as they did not do the rest of my job and they obviously did an abbreviated job on this door jamb since it only took half of the time he estimated. He agreed to refund $100 of the $457.00 I had paid and call me back to schedule the remaining jobs they cancelled after he looked at his schedule. . It is now September 1st and I have never heard from him and never received the $100 refund."
1,Never called back and never showed up. FAIL.
5,"Did a great job on a project that many other companies wouldn't even touch. Great communication. Did what they said they would do, when they said they would do it, and charged what they said it would cost. Would definitely use again and would recommend to others."
3,Problem was solved to my satisfaction and raised the grade to a C
5,"Michael Fay and his team just completed a third job for me within the last 9 months. These guys show up on time, work quickly and efficiently, and do quality work. I have found them to be quite knowledgeable about a diversity of construction related matters. They have handled well complex problems that came up during the first two jobs completed for me. The first job entailed replacing wood that had rotted over several years due to faulty construction -- water had been leaking through siding -- and required the replacement of structural materials in the garage. The situation was much worse than what we suspected before the guys began the job. They did a fine job for what I considered to be a fair price. They next remodeled the kitchen. We chose to keep the original cabinents. When the granite installers showed up they discovered that some of the cabinents were not in shape to support the countertops and the cabinents had not been installed properly some 20 years previous. Michael offered to rebuild the cabinents with quality plywood -- removing the cheap pressboard material used when these things were manufactured. This saved us a lot of money and several weeks of pain that would have come with having a kitchen ripped up while waiting for new cabinents to arrive. They did great work also with laying tile and grouting for the back of the countertops. Michael and team have shown themselves to be honest and quite skilled in doing many different kinds of work. They have skills far beyond what I envision when i hear the word ""handyman."" I would recommend anyone in the Cleveland area to at least get a quote from Michael Fay when considering a home repair or upgrade."
1,"The experience went wrong when they didn't paint the walls carefully. Painted an entire door upstairs including the latch. They left stains all over the walls. They said racial slurs to me concerning hot sauce. The doors to the bathroom and laundry rooms were only painted on one side. The guy was getting angry and felt like I was trying to tell him how to do his job. They were upset that they had to correct their mistakes. I kept informing him that I would be trying to sell my house, and trying to get top dollar for it. Was getting angry that we were informing him of where things needed to be corrected. Informed him that there was a product that could remove the stains he had left. He began to apply the stain remover after I noticed the stains."
5,Very professional and friendly. Performed requested repairs timely and did an excellent job. Work area was immaculate when they left.
5,Installer arrived on time and went right to work. He removed the old door and installed the door I bought at a local box store. He keep the work area clean and took the old door with him. He also filled the gaps in the door frame with insulation. The price didn't seem out of line and I will be calling Mr. Handyman in the future.
5,The workmanship was excellent. No complaints.
5,"I am totally thrilled. I have been unable to open my front door since painting was done over a year ago. Several of my male friends had attempted to open the door, without success. Nick spent less than ten minutes and had the door open. When I commented that he must be really strong, he told me that he worked smart, not strong. He told me even though I had left the door open for twelve hours after painting, the paint continued to cure and it had adhered to the weather stripping. If I had remembered to open the door the next day after painting, I would have been all right. The door opens more easily now than it has in years. Nick opened my side door in even less time than the front door. He replaced a screw in the top hinge with a longer screw. He told me that the problem with that door is the door frame is not totally square because the foundation is no longer level. He told me that even though the door looks crooked in the frame, it will no longer rub at the top corner because the longer screw holds it in place. Before he left, Nick told me that if I use the company again, I should make a list of all of the things I want done to fill up the time, since they charge by the hour. Even though Nick had completed the job in about a half hour, I was more than happy to write my check because he very efficiently did what my brawny friends were unable to do. Nick was friendly and professional and definitely knew what he was doing."
5,"They are?still doing work for us. They get here, do the job, and if they run into any trouble they work through it."
2,"Since I have never received the written estimate of costs, I would say this was a waste of time having him come over to measure my door."
2,"After I approved the quote for the first property and the work did not start for a week to ten days, I called back and was told that some emails had gotten screwed up and that they were waiting for a part but work would start soon. After another week or so I called back. I gave all my information and was told that the issue would be looked into and someone would get back to me. No one called back that day or the next. I called again, no less that 3 times and gave my information only to never be called back. To this date, no one has done any work or called me back to let me know what is going on. It has been over a month since my initial call to Mr Handyman. Needless to say, I am going to find someone else to do the work. As far as I know, no one has even gone out to the second property to look at the job. No one has ever called me back with a quote."
5,"DELIGHTED WITH QUALITY, SKILL, AND RESOURCEFULNESS, AND WILLINGNESS TO COLLABORATE WITH AN EDUCATED EYE TO COST EFFECTIVENESS."
5,"My dog ate through my door frame in a panic attack! Dan from Mr. Handyman came out and cut out the damage and replaced it, as good as new! Mr. Handyman was less than half the cost of other quotes, and the work was well done! Being a single girl, cost is definitely an important factor in my buying decision! Great response time, friendly tech...even showed up early! I will call them again in the future! Highly recommended! A+++"
5,"Excellent. Everything went smoothly and project was done professionally. I will be using Dan in the future for tiling (sidesplash) in the kitchen and to install a wood floor in the kitchen, dining room and living room."
5,"Day one, patch about 12 holes, fill in areas around breaker box and first coat of sheetrock. day two. second coat of sheetrock. day three final sand smooth areas (needed hardly any sanding) and texture ceiling patches. Overall the work was PERFECT. Super high quality work. The man who did the work came in, assessed the situation, and got right to work. I will admit it is not an easy task we gave him and thats why it cost so much. in the end they worked quickly and did excellent work which was important because we were trying to get our house ready to sell and didnt want holes everywhere in the basement as an unfinished project. I should have called them a year ago instead of thinking I could do it myself."
5,"We have contracted Deitmar's services several times for various odd jobs around our home. Most recently, he installed a ceiling fan and in-wall safe. He is always professional, cleans up any mess and punctual. We will continue to contact Deitmar whenever we have an odd job - would highly recommend."
1,They came out and basically wrote down everything that I needed to have done which I thought I could have just given them over the phone. The guy that came out said that could not give me an estimate but someone else would reach out within two days with the estimate. I waited over two weeks and have not heard back from them.
5,good job...on time and professional..and cleaned up the mess...
1,Mr. Handyman never showed up for his service appointment. Please do not schedule with them.
1,Called twice and left a message twice the week of 5/5/2014. Never got a return phone call.
5,"Misc services. Hanging curtain rods, pictures, shelves. Fix leaking shower."
4,Chose a different contractor based on expedited scheduling requirements.
1,unfortunately I was told he did not provide service on the NE side. Or should I say my home address. Athough the ad states East and West.
5,Very prompt and on time.? Always cleans up.? Does a great job with everything.
5,"It went fine. Handyman easily and quickly repaired the door and exposed brick outside. He also mounted a few photos. He was on time, professional and friendly."
1,"Charged me to come and fix the gutter guards that they have installed. Gutter guards have COMPLETELY fallen off. I have called there 5 times, and I get the same response that someone in the office will get back to me, however no one has bothered to call me. I have given them an ample opportunity to come out and fix this issue. All they have to do is call me one time and we can rectify this problem. I would tell them to not ignore your customers. Showed up at my house without contacting me, luckily I was able to come home to oversee the work. If they come out and fix this issue, all will be well."
5,"Worker arrived in timely fashion and finished what he could. He could not do the tuckpointing because it was raining, so he came back the next day and finished that part. This is the third time I've used this company and have yet to be disappointed!"
4,"It went well! Contractor was on time, courteous and offered a cost-effective solution to the repairs."
5,It went well. He was prompt. We told him what we needed done and he took care of it. It took him less than half a day.
5,"because we had already moved to N Carolina, Michael's team had additional hurdles to gain access for several visits our realtor said that they had done a great job, and we will use him again, if we need anything else done!"
5,fine. do not send this again as you have sent it multiple times and i have submitted this in the past. yr service is good but please do not send me anymore reviews to fill out for mr handyman avon ohio thanks
5,Michael was prompt each and every visit. This gave our tenants confidence that he'd be there when told at least 1 day in advance
1,"The handyman worked for a few hours on various projects for us, then proceeded to make a slew of ""freshman mistakes"" during the course of the day. He incorrectly hung up our towel rack (did not use a leveler so it was lopsided and did not ask me where we wanted it to be placed) then started to put together my baby's dresser. There was a damaged part of the dresser and he continued to put this together without asking me what the next steps were (e.g. continue to put it together or disassemble it since we needed to return it.) When I confronted the technician about this, he would NOT discount my rate. He left angry, left a semi-assembled dresser and would not take responsibility for his actions. Not only that, but he also had a laundry list of projects left for him that were unfinished. I contacted Michael Fay who only agreed to discount my rate and come out days later to both disassemble the damaged dresser and reassemble the new one as I had a limited amount of time to disassemble the dresser and return it to in order to get a new dresser. This never happened. He was only able to come out days later as they were ""busy"" and offered the same technician who did the work before (I did not want the original technician to come who did the shoddy work). He called a day before coming out and said that they would no longer be coming out and they would just not charge me. Days later I received a bill (with a discount) after he had previously told me that we would not be getting a bill. When I informed him that he originally said that I would not be charged, he sent a threatening email and said that he had ""changed his mind."" Not good business practices. I would NEVER work with Michael Fay or any of his technicians ever again. Here's why - if you have a client issue, you resolve it and fast. You never go back on your word if you saw its on us and then charge people. You don't leave a project unresolved. Lastly, you do not threaten your customers. I hope that this is a ""teachable moment"" for Michael about what ""not"" to do."
5,"The personnel did an excellent job. He did his job, and finished it at the time he allotted. He was a nice guy."
5,"Overall, the experience was very pleasant. Within a day after I contacted Mr. Handyman through e-mail, I received a phone call. He made arrangements at my convenience to come to the house and give us an estimate. ( very happy with the estimate ) . He informed us that he would watch the weather situation and as soon as it was warmer, he would set up the appointment to repair the frame. This was also at our convenience, as we informed him originally that this project was not urgent and we preferred it not be done until the weather would permit us to do the follow up painting that would be needed, after the project was completed. As soon as the weather permitted, he called us to set up a time to do the job. The handyman that came was very punctual and very friendly. He explained to me exactly how this happens ( the rotted wood ) and he described the material that he would be using to replace this section. This was a very tight fit and he displayed alot of patience with the continuous measuring and recutting of the material to make it a good fit . The final cost turned out to be even less than the estimate which was a pleasant surprise for us. I have other small projects and one by one will be calling Mr. Handyman in the future. While he was here, I had asked for advice on another issue I have, and he was very informative and explained several different options that could be used to do that repair. Not asking for any kind of an estimate at the time, but I was relieved to hear there were different options to resolve that problem also."
5,"Called for and received estimate. Work was scheduled to be performed at our convenience. Repairman was punctual, knowledgeable and friendly, Price was very fair and work is very good."
5,Overall it was a good experience. I gave a B for price only because i normally do my own work but couldn't reach the vents. I also gave a B for quality only because the individual who performed the work left some screws in the driveway where they were parked.
4,"The caprenter's name was Jim, very nice and knew just what to do. (I had a leaky porch roof and needed some stairs rebuilt) They make the steps at their plant and brought them to the house. All was done in the two days they said they would be."
5,"It went very well from the initial estimate to the finished work. The estimate was what I was expecting to pay, and the follow through and actual work was done professionally and promptly. I am very pleased."
5,"I have used them before. They knew my house and I knew them, which made it much easier. They were quite reasonable and worked quickly. They had all the equipment. They did a really good job and did what I wanted."
5,They were very nice and did a great job. They were professional and I was very pleased with the service.
5,It was excellent; they were friendly and did the job well.
5,"The owner came to my house the night before my schedule appointment to take a look at what needed to be done, exactly. When Bill (the handyman) showed up the next day he was fairly well prepared on what needed to be done. He cut out one plank (I was afraid more would need to be removed) about 16 inches long and popped in a new one. Bill was very nice and let me watch as he worked. All in all it took about an hour and it was all finished."
1,It didn't go at all.........we did not/will not hire him after poor responsiveness to request for an estimate.
5,"I called Mr. Handyman and requested an estimate for the repairs to my porch. Mike was that person who came out within that week and gave me a prompt estimate over the phone the same day. I was still looking for other estimates ( which I had to wait 3 weeks for). I found that the price was much lower that the others. When we scheduled the work, they were out within 1 week. The work was done within one day. I thought one board on the porch looked ""funny"" and he come out right away and replaced it. No muss, no fuss. He will be handling all of my repairs in the future. Way to go Mike!!!"
1,There were two stages to the job. Removed the roof and the supports of columns. He did not replaced them and replaced it with a thinner grade for the roof. After he took $45.00 for the discounts he did not take that off. The total came out to $2980.00. I realized that the job did not look supportive and the chair were puncturing the roof. He offered a full deck roofing to be put down. I could not do it because I was leaving. He said he would womanized replacement on the roof. He punctured the roofing materials and it was no longer good. By that time I was gone. I asked my brother to go and take a look at it. My son who is a roof carpenter was so upset for the work. I'm back now and I need to get the work done now.
5,They did a nice job. The young guy showed right up and looked over things and told me how much it would be. Then within a few days a gentlemen showed up and did the painting and everything was good. They were prompt and nice. They got everything finished in one day and didn't mess around. I would definitely call them again for work around the house.
5,Very efficient with call back to review work to be done and provide estimate. Quick scheduling of work and gentleman that performed the work was very friendly and professional and did a great job. Trim looks great.
1,"Came out and looked at our utility room and our small bathroom. We didn’t hear from him for two weeks. Finally, I called for the proposal. I feel he should have called us sooner, also he wanted to charge us $2,000.00 for the work. Which i feel was way over priced for the work."
2,"I had some issues with the work that they did but it got resolved. They completed 90% of how the work should have been completed. I spent a few bucks on them to complete it. It is complete now but there were some hazels with the guy who was running it. Now, everything is complete. They customized some stuff in the kitchen for me but I have an issue with the final work that they did. I spent a week and a half with them. I gave them a shot because their overall pricing was good. I needed them to fix something that they had to put together but I ended up having to make them do some work after I paid them. Now, they have got the money so I am probably not going to use them again."
5,I have been using this company 7 years. They are excellent and always finish the job. They are reasonably price and are punctual.
4,"I have a strong recollection not of what he looked like, but of what he worked like. I would not call him again. I had him install a wall shelf--which I asked him to attach to the wall. He had to do it twice because the first time it was not level . He had a helper with him who did nothing but hand him tools. He charged, what I would say was a considerable amount. Other than charging too much, he was fine."
4,He was good. The door went and it works. They are right on time and cleaned up after themselves.
5,I had a pull chain previously. They came in and put a new light switch. They were not very expensive and the quality of work was good. I was satisfied with their service.
5,They explained everything to me and the job went very well. I like that I can call them up and they will come out usually within the week. They will accommodate my schedule and have even come on a weekend. I will use them again.
4,"The appointment manager returned my call promptly, unlike other electircians that I had called. He asked that I send him a picture of the fixture and sent someone out. The actual serviceman found that he needed to go buy a new fixture, but he did so and replaced it. He was professional and courteous. Unfortunately, due to the unplanned shopping trip, he asked that we reschedule having the garage grounded, which had originally ben included in our request. Otherwise we were quite pleased and would use this service again."
4,"He sent a technician out and he did fine. I tried to call the owner to negotiate the estimate, but he refused to return my calls. He tried to bill me $830 for 3 1/2 hours of work in total."
4,"It went very well after Jim G came, but he was not the person who came and gave me the estimate. Apparently Mr. Fri wanted off today. I was happy that Jim G got all the work done."
5,I recommended him and he did a considerable amount of work for me. There was a leak and he did some tile work and repaired the ceiling. The leak alternatively was supposed to be fixed by the plumber but which wouldn’t. He was pretty damn good. He came and adjusted our schedule. The man he sent was very nice. They did the work and the work is nice. I thought that the guys who came were a bit slow as they were paid on hourly basis and I thought that they could have done faster. They were pleasant and did the work. I thought that they took more time but it was okay. Basically they were good. They did the job and got it done. It took two times to diagnose the leak eventually.
5,"It is not easy to get a provider to do a relatively small job this time of year, with constant rain periods requiring schedule adjustment. Previous experience with another firm was a total waste of time, as they just didn't show up. Michael responded with in a few days and had someone up on the roof for a quote quickly. Missed one appointment, due to rain, but came two days later.A huge problem off my plate as I just had surgery."
5,"I called on Oct. 7th and Mr. Fay sent someone out the same day to check things out. He called back later in the day to say that someone would be out to the house on Monday morning. The repairman was very personable, concerned and thorough. I would absolutely use this company again. I do not think that the price is out of line, and it is worth it to me to get these nagging little things done. In fact, the railing on my stairway just broke and Ill probably be calling them again to replace it, if they can!"
5,The work was performed in not the best of conditions. The laundry area was crowded and not a lot of room to work. The exhaust vent went into the attic and not easily accessible. Both problems were solved to my satisfaction.
1,never showed for his appointment with us. Never called us.
1,Did not come to my home to give an estimate or call me back after more than two weeks.
5,"it went very well , Jim arrived on time and everything was done quickly and neatly"
3,"I also bought a double lock set so he could replace the locks on the front and back doors. He replaced the back door lock but did not touch the front door lock. When I tried to use the new key on the front door, I had to replace the front door lock myself."
5,This is a step by step procedure with time needed in between for drying of materials used in the various phases. This my main bathroom & they were prompt in arriving in a timely manner as the were able to continue with the next step. I have used them before and will use them again
5,"I had water in my basement and was not sure why. I called and they came out immediately (within an hour) and determined that my sump pump had stopped working. This was a Thursday. They helped me clean up the water and arranged to provide me with a quote for the pump. The next day there was more water so I called them again and they were right back. One of the gentlemen even offerred to bring me his personal dehumidifier to help dry the space. Over the weekend they called to make sure I was not having any more problems. On Monday they replaced the sump pump nd the back-up pump. While they were there, they also replaced my doorbell and a couple of very high light bulbs. The best part of the service was that it was clear they cared about the service they provided. I was not just another customer on the list - they went out of their way to make sure I was satisfied. This was not the first time I have used this company and I would do so again without hesitation."
1,I sent email and left phone messages and was never contacted...finally just decided to go with someone else.
5,"They did a wonderful job, and I would not hesitate to use them again. I would highly recommend them to others. They were professional, on time, and neat."
5,"It went very well. This is the third time that I have had work done by Mr. Handyman, and I am always pleased with their work."
5,"EXCELLENT service. Complete professionalism, expert quality workmanship. The gentleman came exactly on time, worked incredibly quickly and treated my home with care and respect. They will be my go to guys for handy work in the future!"
5,"Everything went very well! They are very prompt, professional, and get everything done right."
5,"I had pigeons on my bedroom awning, so they installed the spikes to take care of the issue. Everything was super!"
2,"Michael had come out and gave us an estimate. We already had the wood from floors we had done earlier. When Michael looked at the project, he stated the left over wood would be enough to complete the job. He quoted us $1200 for the project and we offered to pay cash for a $100 discount. His carpeter, Jim, showed up two hours late the day of the job. As far as the quality of the work, it was satisfactory. When Jim got to the second landing, the last part of the project, he stated there was not enough wood to complete. He claimed he could use his wood and try to use carpeting as well. He did not finish that day and would come back on Tuesday 6/1/10. He completed the everything but the second landing on Tuesday. We feel we should receive some money back since they did not complete the full project we hired them to do. I asked them if it was fair to pay a lower price since they did not complete the contract. He was not willing to lower the price to $1000, or $100 off for the incomplete work. He became very upset and would only lower the price to $1040. After speaking with Jim, Michael hung up the phone before explaining the same price to me. I waited on the phone for him to talk to me about it after speaking with Jim, but he did not. I was very upset by this lack of courtesy. I also wanted to use the coupon through Angie's List ($25 off) and they made this seem like a large issue as well. I decided not to push the issue since they were unwilling to work with us on the incomplete job. If he was willing to charge $1000 for the work, I would have been satisfied."
5,"He repaired the door problem and installed the closer in a short time. I had to pay a one hour minimum, so I had him move a nightstand and my bed to make wheelchair access easier."
5,"Everything turned out well. The water damage on the ceiling looked great when they were done, and it blended in perfectly. The price is very good, and they are courteous and prompt. Having the debris removed took a little longer than I would have liked, but they were neat otherwise. I was happy with their work and would use them again."
5,"They are fantastic. When I called the company, they said they could do it the next morning because I had to work around a doctor appointment, which was no problem. They were here promptly and were very courteous and friendly. They just took control of everything and got the job done. I loved them, and it looks beautiful."
5,He fixed that and also he did a few other things to finish the hour he was charging us for. He was super and I would recommend him to others.
5,Good job. No supervision needed. Only they wanted a credit card hold -- probably because I was a first time customer.
4,I was told that the job was relatively small and would probably only take an hour. They could be out the following afternoon. I had to provide the make and color of our vinyl siding. When I got home the following afternoon nothing was done. I waited until Thursday morning and called to see what happened. When the worker picked up the piece of siding he didn't know until he reached the house that the store gave him the wrong color. He had to go back and get the right color. The office person was very apologetic that no one called to let me know. They came that afternoon and fixed the corner. It looks great.
5,I was very pleased with their work. They were very professional. They were on time and cleaned up after themselves. i would definitely refer them to other people.
5,"We have had no problems at all, and the project turned out well."
5,"Good experience. I'm an out-of-state landlord, so my tenant called Mr. Handyman based on word of mouth. The person who took the call recommended that we obtain a new disposer rather than buy through them, in order to save some money. That worked out well, and the repair work was painless for my tenant."
5,He did a good job on each and I am thinking of hiring him again.
4,"The owner was fine. The man who came to fix our siding tried to charge us over $200 more than the original quote. I had to tell him what the original quote was and so he called the employee to check if that was correct. It made for an awkward situation. I did pay them a little extra for working hard, but I was still thrown for a loop. Overall, I was pleased with the quality of the work."
5,Jim was great. He works very hard and the quality was excellent.
5,"I spoke to Kathy and she was very good and professional over the phone. They are acceptable and I was very happy to talk to a live person instead of a voice mail. They are there everyday apparently from 9 to 5, and I really like that. I would most definitely call them again if need be."
5,They are very nice and competent. They corrected everything. They have done very neat work. I am very pleased.
4,"It did not take very long to get the wallpaper off. The employee patched the drywall and let this work day overnight. He returned the next day to prime the surface and paint it. Since he painted the surface shortly after priming it, there was a tendency for the primer and paint to mix and/or for the paint to mix with caulk that he applied between the shower/bath fixture and wall to prevent future moisture penetration. A few weeks later I put an layer of paint on most of all of the surface above the bath/shower."
5,He did good work and at a fair price.
1,"IN MY ESTIMATION, MR. HANDYMAN SHOULD NOT HAVE EVEN CONSIDERED CHARGING MORE THAN $40-50, WHEN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WAS ACCOMPLISHED. THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS A REAL SHOCK TO ME SINCE MY EXPERIENCE WITH CONTRACTORS RATED A ON ANGIES LIST HAVE, UP UNTIL TODAY, BEEN EXTREMELY PROFICIENT AND WORTHY OF THEIR EXCELLENT ""A"" RATING. MR. HANDYMAN GETS AN ""F""!"
5,"They were very good & were very prompt with returning phone calls, very professional & did an excellent job of diagnosing the problem & correcting it. I would hire them again in the future."
5,"They were trustworthy, nice, pleasant, professional and did a very good job."
5,It was very good. He just seemed to be very knowledgeable about being a handyman. He gives out a very confident air about him. He was very respectful and polite.
5,"This company was great and I will use them again. They came out in the exact time frame I needed. The worker was very professional, and when I called they gave me some suggestions to help me save money. The final service ended up being less expensive than the quoted price on the phone. Overall this company is very efficient and I would recommend them and use them anytime in the future."
5,"On time, very polite, good job & reasonably priced."
5,"Jim worked hard and professionally the whole time he was here. He had the right tools for the jobs, except on one occasion. I was very pleased with his work. When he was done I finished by painting the posts and caps and they look good."
5,"I hired the Mr. Handymen crew 2 - 3 times while preparing to put our house on the market. They were very responsive, willing to do a variety of jobs, even adding some newly discovered jobs onto their list after they had come to the house. If they didn't have the tools they needed, they ran out to get it. Very easy to work with, fast, and efficient."
5,"Mr. Handyman gives you the option to purchase your own goods. I chose them to purchase and do the work. They charge $130 an hour. It seemed high to me, but since I cannot do the work I was satisfied that it was done in a timely manner."
5,"The technicians were very helpful, courteous and personable. I have used them for larger jobs in the past and would definitely use them again."
3,"I wouldn't hire him for doing my lights again. I just thought that he was too expensive for putting up just Christmas lights. The work was adequate, though."
5,"They were fine! They were able to do the work just fine, and they were very easy to work with. The task was completed before the end of the pre-paid time period."
4,"He charged for one hour, regardless of how long the job took."
5,"They did a great job. Professional, work man like staff. Good office and scheduling support and attention to detail. Flexible to small changes. Any issues that a rose were handled expertly. We are having them quote our kitchen remodel now."
1,"STOP! Beware! Don t let their ad confuse you! Mr. Handyman was hired to install a shower door in a brand new bathroom. While they were on the job we added the tissue holder and towel bar. We contacted Mr. Handyman because the door was leaking. They sent out a tech to assess the problem & sealed where the thought the leak was. Needless to say it was still leaking after use of the shower. This went on for many days and many visits for Mr. Handyman to attempt to correct this problem. Michael Fay (owner) had us convinced we purchased a defective door. We went to a supply store and found Mr. Handyman installed the door incorrectly. The technician did not use all the hardware and cut the bottom track too short (see picture). After 30 days of not getting positive results working with Mr. Handyman, door still leaking, hardware still missing, mess every time they are back to assess the problem using my tools, I requested a full refund. Another 30 days pass with numerous request for a refund, Michael refuses the refund and wants to continue to come back to stop the leak. I felt after 60 days of no results a refund was not asking too much. Michael hired an attorney and sent a settlement agreement and release in the amount of $180. We accepted just so we could put an end to this nonsense. Mr. Handyman is not capable of installing a shower door. Mr. Handyman charged us $125 to install a tissue holder and towel bar. For all the inconvenience, damage to the walls, adjusting working schedules if any charge at all due should have been the $78 for the first hour per his business description. Perhaps Michael is saying it took Mr. Handyman over an hour to install a tissue holder and towel bar."
5,"It went excellent. All the phone calls, setting up, making a list of estimates for me all went great. I could decide which ones I wanted to pick from. I chose them all. His name is Bill Arison."
5,Thankful for their willingness to provide immediate service in an emergency.
5,He does an excellent job. It's $78 for the first hour and $39 for each additional half hour. I will continue to use his services.
5,"The company sent a professional employee to help with some home repairs. The work was done expertly and in a timely fashion. The fellow who did the work was conscientious, he cleaned up after himself and I was comfortable having him in my home. I HIGHLY recommend Mr. Handyman for help with home repairs. I can not say enough good about them!"
5,"All work perfectly, and he never 'cut corners', even after I told him that would be acceptable."
1,"The job was well performed but they charged $80.00/hour which is pretty steep. But to add insult to injury, they charge a $40.00 appointment fee (?). I do not pay such a fee when I schedule a doctor's appointment or make an appointment for car repair. This $40.00 is just plain greed. Angie's List should not honor such businesses that clearly ""rip off"" the customer."
5,They made an appointment to do the work.
4,I didn't the quality of their work. They charge by the hour and the job took longer than it should have. If I would have know they charged by the hour I wouldn't have hired them.
1,Bill came to my house on 9/21 in order to give me an estimate on replacing my fence. As of 10/18 he has not contacted me with the estimate.
4,"I realized the toilet seal was leaking and running down the wall in the garage. I knew Mr. Handyman was expensive, but they were the only ones who could come out within a week. I thought I'd have to have the flooring repaired but was told it wasn't necessary. A few weeks later I noticed a rocking when sitting on the toilet. hey came back out and screwed down both bolts on each side of the toilet."
5,"Brent found that previous owner had added under sink instant hot water heater, using outlet previously occupied by dishwasher. Dishwasher was now hardwired to 'lighting' breaker. Brent came the same day that I called."
5,Jim was here at 9 o'clock on Monday morning when arrived he said that the cost would be around $139.00. Jim repaired the handle on the stove. Jim was very fast and also saved me a lot of money because the final cost was $39.00.
5,"Michael was prompt and helpful, making suggestions that only a real pro would have known. The seller contacted the builder Ryan Homes, who sent a crew to make those repairs, even though the home itself was past the warranted period. I paid Michael for the beautiful writeup of his estimate, great guy to work with! Thanks, Michael!"
5,"I especially liked the technician that came out, he was very professional and knowledgeable. They were very responsive and I got prompt service."
4,"Company was fine. They didn't show up when they were supposed to but, they did come out the second time I called."
3,"They were most responsive. I live out of town, and they would say they did the work, and someone would go look for me and the work wasn't completed."
3,"Most of the work the carpenter did was excellent. There seemed to be some sort of communication error between the owner and the carpenter. The entire job was expected to take 1.5 days. It took 2.5. The owner quoted me 1535 for the work. I left a detailed list of what I believed to be part of the quote with a request that someone call me if it deviated from the quote. The carpenter built a detailed rail system that was both not asked for and not quoted. The owner later tried to charge me for it, claiming the facia board - which he apparently didn't quote - took too long. I refused and canceled the remaining work. He called 2 days later and explained that most of the over run was caused by the rail system. He offered to finish the work for the quoted price, I agreed to pay a bit more because I like the railing. After the dispute, I thought the remaining work was slightly sub standard indicating a desire to cut the companies losses. Painting was especially bad."
5,"We were very happy with everything, starting with the phone conversation with the person who makes the appointments. She explained everything in detail. The work was done to our satisfaction and the technician was very professional. We would definitely call Mr. Handyman for future work."
4,They're very friendly and efficient.
5,Everytime he was on time and did a great job! It is nice to have everything in the house working right! I would call again!
5,"Bill was very functional! He was neat, clean, pleasant. He came in a head of time, finished before the estimated time! There were a couple jobs that he said he didn't feel comfortable doing, so they'll be back in a couple days with some one else that can price the jobs. They originally wouldn?t honor the Angie?s List, and I was told by Mr. Fay that they put both coupons on this next bill. I was told that because this work was a continuation of previous work they would waive the $39 fee. They didn?t take care of the bill while they were at the house and I had to sign a paper saying that they would take care of it at the office. I want $89 refund to honor the 2 coupons and the $39 fee."
5,The electrician showed up and installed both lights. No problems.
5,"They were extremely pleasant, real flexible. My neighbor came over and they took two antennas off his roof. They're just really nice people to be around."
5,"He got everything taken care of for me. He did a very good job, and even though they were different job, he knew how to take care of everything."
5,"Service tech Bill Gantz was punctual, well informed, pleasant and definitely qualified for my requirements."
4,"I called them and they were willing to come out the same day to do the work, but I was not ready. They were at the house the next day and completed the job quickly, efficiently, and courteously. I would definitely call them again!"
5,The things repaired were things that needed doing since we first moved in. They were done well and with a minimum of fuss.
5,"Overall experience excellent. Will definitely use service again. Great service for small jobs. Very punctual. Jim, the technician, very nice. Answered all questions, quality of work was great."
5,"They called to set an appointment for an estimate. They arrived on time and spent time evaluating job and talking with us. We were given a written estimate and told we'd get a call the next day to set time for workman to arrive. The time was set, the workman arrived punctually, and the work was done professionally and to our complete satisfaction. We'd call them again without hesitation."
5,He fixed the problem and did a good job. He was friendly and an overall nice guy.
1,"When I called I got a sales pitch. I let them know what I wanted. They said they do not give estimates, they only come out and do the job. She put me on hold and then said someone would come out the same day to take a look. I waited and waited when finally about 4:30 I received a voiemail saying he wasn't in the area and they would get back to me by the end of the week. I never heard from them."
5,"After trying for weeks to have another handyman come over but never returned calls, I called Mr. Handyman. They were very detailed, gave me all the information up front on pricing and how the appointment would be handled. They even called the day before to confirm the appointment. They were on time, very efficient and only charged for the time they were there. I will definitely call them again for little things around the house because they were so professional, reliable, and did a great job."
5,Have asked for several estimates. They always get back to you with an answer within a week; the office girl is very good.
5,"Dan the service technician for Mr Handyman arrived on right date/time and offered a cordial greeting. Kathy, Office Admin. had left me a confirm/reminder message on previous business day which is always nice to get. Dan looked over job first, set up his sawhorse and tools and got right to work. I have used the services of Mr. Handyman before and do have confidence in their skills and ability to do the job correctly. Mr Handyman does not give estimates, paid or not. They don't tell you either what job materials to get. There is currently a two hour minimum fee so you really have to know what you need to be done and the correct materials on hand to do the job. My understanding is they will go and buy the materials for you but that costs extra. It forces the customer to research the project in order to buy right supplies before hand. That is the part that stresses me the most. Live and learn, I guess. You do get what you pay for, your projects promptly and professionally completed."
1,I left a message and they have not returned my call.
2,"He charges $195 for the first hour, including just to come out and take a look. Following that he charges $19.95 per quarter hour. I didn't even have him come out because of his price."
5,"When I called, the service asked all the right questions and took great notes. When Jim arrived he had a print out of virtually everything I had said, so he was very prepared. Jim was on time (actually 10 minutes early), laid down drop cloths, and did some of the more grimy work outside to limit the dirt in my house. Jim also spent the time to really diagnose my problems rather than jumping to the conclusion that I needed new equipment. His diligence and innovative solutions kept me from buying new parts of about $200."
5,"Very positive. The handyman came the same day I called. Very pleasant, professional and knowledgeable man!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
1,They never called. I am disappointed that they never called back to give me an estimate. I did think that was unprofessional.
5,I'VE SAID IT ALL. THEY DO WHAT WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO.
2,I feel that they were unprofessional by not getting back to me with an estimate. I would not contact them again.
5,"Fast, efficient, hard working, and thorough worker. Brought concrete and 4x4. I had the mailbox. I got a free fire extinguisher."
5,The Handyman Company is a company that is extremely professional. They treat customers with respect and really care about satisfying their customers!! They were great communicators. They were proud of their work.
5,Excellent! Prompt service and extremely nice service tech!
5,"BILL WAS ON TIME. HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO, HAD THE TOOLS NEEDED AND LASTED NO TIME IN ACCOMPLISHING THE TASK. WE WERE VERY IMPRESSED AND GRATEFUL TO GET THE WORK DONE IN SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME."
5,They were very professional. They were on time and courteous.
5,Service was prompt and efficient. Service tech was very courteous and professional. Price was reasonable & fair.
5,"I am happy as he was on time and done quick. He arrived before the scheduled time. Labor charge is $78 per hour. I thought it was interesting that as soon as he entered the house, he put plastic covers over his shoes. He was very clean and didn't leave a mess when finished."
5,"WE HAD 4 TOTALLY DIFFERENT JOBS ALL SIMPLE, BUT NOT WORTH CALLING AN ELECTRICIAN, PLUMBER OR CARPENTER. MR. HANDYMAN IS A GREAT RESOURCE, WHEN MANY SMALL JOBS ARE NEEDED AND ALL THE WORK WAS DONE IN 2 HOURS."
5,HE WAS ON TIME & DID THE WORK COMPLETELY.
5,"TOM WAS EARLY, VERY POLITE AND HELPFUL. I WILL DEFINITELY USE MR. HANDYMAN AGAIN."
5,JOB WAS COMPLETED PROFESSIONALLY & ON TIME. COMMUNICATION TO ME WAS PROMPT & ACCURATE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM FOR GENERAL HOUSE REPAIRS.
5,THEY DID A GOOD JOB BUT A LITTLE PRICEY.
2,"DID NOT POWERWASH DOOR FRAMES, WINDOW FRAMES, GARAGE DOOR, FRONT OF HOME (BRICK). CAME BACK THREE TIMES TO MAKE RIGHT. STILL HAVE NOT POWERWASHED GARAGE DOOR OR BRICK FRONT. APPARENTLY POWERWASHING DOES NOT INCLUDE ENTIRE HOME."
5,"VERY PROFESSIONAL, SHOWED UP ON TIME FOR ESTIMATING AND TO COMPLETE JOB. QUALITY OF WORK WAS VERY GOOD."
5,"USED ANGIE'S COUPON FOR $25 OFF. VERY QUICK AND OFFERED SUGGESTIONS, VERY NEAT AND PERSONABLE."
5,"I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH ALL THEIR WORK. THERE WAS ONE INDIVIDUAL THAT PERFORMED ALL THESE VARIOUS JOBS & DID EACH PROFESSIONALLY. HE WAS EFFICIENT, COURTEOUS, & PLEASANT TO HAVE AROUND THE HOUSE (HE EVEN HELPED A NEIGHBOR WHO ASKED TO MOVE SOME LARGE STONES WHILE HE WAS WAITING FOR SOME PAINT TO DRY). HE ALSO WAS HELPFUL TO ME WITH ADVICE ON HOW TO APPROACH SEVERAL MINOR REPAIRS JOBS THAT I WAS DOING MYSELF. THEY DISCLOSE THAT THEY HAVE AN ""ADD-ON"" CHARGE TO ANY MATERIALS THEY PURCHASE FOR THE WORK. I PURCHASED MOST OF MY OWN MATERIAL TO LIMIT THIS COST (THE EXCEPTION WAS THE PAINT FOR THE BASEMENT FLOOR). I CALLED THEM AFTER THE INITIAL WORK TO HAVE THEM PAINT THE BASEMENT FLOOR, SO IT MAY HAVE BEEN CHEAPER IF I HAD INCLUDED THE BASEMENT FLOOR IN THE INITIAL CONTRACT OF WORK. ONLY MINOR COMPLAINT IS THAT FOLLOW-UP PHONE CALLS ARE SOMETIMES SLOW. THIS IS A MINOR ISSUE FROM MY STANDPOINT &, I SUSPECT, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE BUSY."
5,"TOM CAME OUT TO THE HOUSE TO DO THE WORK. HE WAS VERY PERSONABLE AND PROFESSIONAL. ONE OF THE MIRRORS WAS INSTALLED USING WIRE, WHICH BY NO FAULT OF HIS, BROKE IN HALF. HE REPAIRED AND COMPLETELY PAINTED THE WALL AND REHUNG THE MIRROR. HE WENT OVER AND ABOVE HIS JOB TO MAKE US HAPPY. I WOULD LOVE TO USE TOM AGAIN, AND PROBABLY WILL. WHAT I DO NOT LIKE IS THE SERVICE CHARGE OF $35 TACKED ON TO THE $70 PER HOUR FEE, WHICH I CONSIDER STEEP. MAYBE THEY SHOULD CONSIDER A YEARLY ''MEMBERSHIP'' FEE INSTEAD OF $35-40 SERVICE CHARGE PER VISIT."
5,"TOM - THEIR REPRESENTATIVE CAME OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS NEEDED FIRST, TOLD ME WHAT PARTS TO GET, CALLED TO VERIFY WHEN HE WAS COMING, CAME ON TIME, DID A QUICK EFFICIENT JOB, AND EXPLAINED WHAT HE WAS DOING."
5,I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIS WORK AND WOULD CERTAINLY CALL HIM AGAIN. HE ARRIVED RIGHT ON TIME AND DID HIS WORK PROMPTLY.
5,"VERY PROFESSIONAL, EASY TO GET APPOINTMENT, DID A GREAT JOB."
5,"MICHAEL THE OWNER WAS FRIENDLY AND COURTEOUS. TOM THE HANDYMAN WAS NOT JUST ON TIME, BUT EARLY. HE WAS POLITE, FRIENDLY, EFFICIENT, WILLING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS DURING THE JOB, DIDN'T SMOKE OR LISTEN TO LOUD MUSIC AND WAS EVEN CREATIVE WHEN ASKED TO MOVE LARGE TREE TRUNK PIECES TO ANOTHER SPOT IN THE BACK YARD. THE PIECES WERE PLACED ARTFULLY. I WAS ABSOLUTELY OVERALL PLEASED WITH THE WORK WHICH TOOK A TOTAL OF 3 1/2 DAYS. TOM DID A WONDERFUL CLEANUP JOB. THE ONLY THING I HAD TO DO WAS VACUUM THE SAWDUST FROM THE PORCH AFTER TOM HAD FIT A LOT OF TASKS INTO THE 2ND DAY, FINISHING UP IN THE FINAL HOUR. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF HE HAD VACUUMED, BUT THAT'S THE LEAST I'VE EVER HAD TO DO AS FAR AS CLEANUP AFTER SOMEONE HAS WORKED ON THE PROPERTY, SO I'D SAY THAT'S PRETTY GOOD! THE HOURLY RATE IS $70.00. A BIT MORE THAN OTHER ESTIMATES, BUT WELL WORTH IT."
4,"CLEAN, EXPLAINED WHAT HE WOULD DO AND IN WHAT TIME FRAME."
5,"EXTREMELY PLEASED. QUICK RESPONSE AND EXCELLENT WORK. THE JOB WENT OVER TWO DAYS AND COULDN'T BE HAPPIER WITH THE WORK. WE'RE NOW TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE OTHER SMALL JOBS WE'VE BEEN PUTTING OFF. THE PRICE AND QUALITY ARE IN SYNCH. AND BILL, WHO DID THE JOB, WAS GREAT."
5,"TOM WAS ON TIME, POLITE, PROFESSIONAL AND NEAT. NO MESS AT ALL. VERY NICE JOB. I WOULD USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN."
5,"VERY HELPFUL, OFFERED HONEST ADVICE. PLEASED WITH RESULTS. WOULD CALL THEM AGAIN."
1,"A TIME WAS SET FOR 3 TO 3:30 ON A FRIDAY. I RETURNED HOME TO WAIT FOR THE REPAIR PERSON, BUT HE (OR SHE) NEVER SHOWED OR CALLED. ONE WEEK LATER I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL WANTING TO KNOW IF I STILL NEEDED THE WORK DONE. I TOLD THEM THAT I DID, BUT THAT I WOULD FIND SOMEONE ELSE. HE APOLOGIZED ABOUT MISSING THE APPOINTMENT AND NOT CALLING, BUT I FELT THIS WAS TOO LATE AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I WILL NOT USE THIS SERVICE AGAIN, EVEN THOUGH I DID ANOTHER TIME AND WAS HAPPY WITH THE COMPANY."
4,"SERVICE PERSON WAS PROFESSIONAL, POLITE, COURTEOUS, SEEMS TO BE GOOD WORK. PRICE WAS SURPRISING, BUT EVERYTHING ELSE, INCLUDING THE FACT HE USED BOOTIES TO PROTECT OUR FLOOR, WENT WELL."
4,"good, cleaned up, helpful"
5,Very good job i love it
1,H never showed
1,"I HAVE TRIED TO GET THIS COMPANY TO MY HOME TO GIVE ME AN ESTIMATE, BUT NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING, I DEALT WITH ABOUT 4 DIFFERENT PEOPLE."
5,PRICE WAS REASONABLE I WOULD HIRE AGAIN FOR A FUTURE REPAIR.
5,EXCELLENT SERVICE; WILL USE THEM AGAIN. VERY PROFESSIONAL AND INTERESTED IN DOING A HIGH-QUALITY JOB.
5,HE WAS VERY GOOD AND VERY DEDICATED TO RETURNING PHONE CALLS. HE WOULD GET BACK TO ME TO LET ME KNOW IF HE WAS TIED UP AND HE GOT BACK TO ME ON A SUNDAY. HE IS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND COURTEOUS.
5,WORKED VERY QUICKLY AND DID AN EXCELLENT JOB.
5,HE WAS A VERY NICE GENTLEMAN AND WAS EFFICIENT.
5,THE PRICE NEGOTIATION WENT FROM $540 TO $510 QUICKLY. SERVICE WAS PROMPT AND SCHEDULED EARLY. THE WORKER WAS FRIENDLY AND WORKED EFFICIENTLY.
1,"ALTHOUGH HE WAS VERY NICE, HE SIDE STEPPED MY REQUEST FOR AN ESTIMATE. HE HAS VERY HIGH PRICES. I TAKE THE BLAME FOR NOT PINNING HIM DOWN. HE CHARGED ME $64 FOR THE FIRST HALF HOUR! HE IS NOT AN UP FRONT PERSON. I FEEL HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME. JUST THINK HOW HE MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ELDERLY."
5,"BILL, THE HANDYMAN, WAS VERY POLITE AND ON TIME. DID SPECIFIED WORK IN A VERY TIMELY MANNER. I'VE USED THIS SERVICE TWICE BEFORE THIS AND WAS VERY PLEASED THEN ALSO. I SAVED $25, TOO!"
4,"HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME INVESTIGATING AND PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO IT. HE DISCOVERED IT WAS A VERY MINOR LEAK, BUT THE CONFIGURATION OF THE PLUMBING MADE TOO DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO REPAIR. HE RECOMMENDED A PLUMBER AND DID NOT CHARGE ANYTHING FOR HIS VISIT. I WOULD CONSIDER USING HIM IN THE FUTURE."
5,"HE KINDA DID SOME EXTRA WHEN HE REPAIRED THE WINDOW - HE NOTICED THAT THE TRACK WAS DIRTY, SO HE WENT TO HIS TRUCK AND GOT HIS CLEANER AND CLEANED IT FOR ME - NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE."
5,"THEY REALLY CLEANED UP WELL. THEY WERE PROMPT, PROFESSIONAL, AND FINISHED IN A TIMELY MANNER. I HAD SPECIFIC REQUESTS ABOUT THE TYPE OF MATERIAL TO BE USED, AND THEY MET MY EXPECTATIONS PRECISELY."
5,"ALL WORKED TURNED OUT FINE, VERY GOOD."
4,THEY HAD TO COME BACK TO RE-DO THE BOARDS AND THE GATE.
3,"THE DOOR LOCK WORKS BUT IT DOESN'T TURN VERY WELL, HE WAS NEAT, CLEAN, FRIENDLY, I FELT VERY COMFORTABLE FOR A FUTURE JOB."
5,"POLITE, PROMPT, EASY TO WORK WITH. EXPERIENCED WITH OLDER HOMES. VERY PLEASED."
5,IT WAS A LITTLE BIT PRICEY BUT I AM HAPPY WITH THE WORK. HE NEVER STOPPED OR TOOK A BREAK. HE WAS HARD WORKER. THE CHARGE WAS $60 AND HOUR PER MAN.
5,"RECOMMENDED WE PUT GUTTER COVERS ON OUR GUTTERS , DUE TO THE BERRY TREES WE HAVE IN OUR YARD. HE FOUND SOME COVERS AND BROUGHT THEM BACK TO SHOWED US WHAT TYPE TO USE(WHICH ARE GREAT SO THE BIRDS CAN'T GET IN THE GUTTERS). PROMPT PROFESSIONAL , FRIENDLY. HE GAVE ME A LIST OF ALL THE ITEMS HE DOES THAT INCLUDED 3 COLUMNS OF ITEMS. PURCHASED PAINT HIMSELF FOR THE CLOSET. I WILL USE HIM FOR ALL MY NEEDS. I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER FOR A LONG TIME AND HAVE USED OTHER HANDYMEN FROM THE LIST AND THIS GUY IS SO KNOWLEDGEABLE. JACK OF ALL TRADES, GREAT WORK."
3,I PROBABLY COULD HAVE DONE AS GOOD A JOB MYSELF. UNEVEN TILES AND DIDN'T LEAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR MY FIXTURES.
5,I WOULD RECOMMEND MR HANDYMAN WITHOUT A DOUBT
5,EXTREMELY RELIABLE. GOES OUT OF WAY FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.

5,"Excellent, would hire again"
4,It turned out okay.
3,He was over an hour late
5,I think they do a great job.
5,Consultation only
4,Very well. I am using them again.
5,No other bids were solicited.
5,It went well.
5,The grades speak for themselves.
5,I would recommend them to others.
5,Helpful advice freely given.
5,It was very good.
1,They never returned my calls.
5,EXCELLENT!
5,IT WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE.
5,Kjell responded immediately & with experience to an emergency request to replace a leaking Kitchen Faucet. Much appreciated.
5,Job went very well. Kjell and his crew were very professional and neat. Showed up on time. Good communication and easy to work with. Worked steady and completed the job in a timely manner. Would definitely hire them again.
5,"Excellent. Kjell resurfaced and refinished most parts of three bathrooms. The project took time, but went well and I'm very pleased with the result."
5,Great job! Would definitely hire again. Professional nd couteous.
1,"After a brief description of what I needed, the response was ""I don't mean to be rude, but do you want me to take on an 'afro-american project'?"" When I asked him to explain what he meant, he said ""do you want me to do a fix with like rubber-bands and bubble gum"". Enough said. Seems guys like this are less afraid of the light and are crawling out of the woodwork. Must be the Trump effect."
5,He's very honest and I would trust him with anything. I'll put it this way: I'd let him be in my house even if I wasn't here.
5,"Kjell was very busy with other projects but was able to fit us into his schedule. Communication was good, we kept in touch up until the day before he was supposed to come over to do the installation. Day of, he showed up early and got to work right away. The closet kit he installed looks great and was installed faster than I thought! Prices were reasonable, I will be calling him again for future needs."
5,He is wonderful. In fact he is coming today to do some work and I have a list for him. He has email and I email him my wish list and he told me when is available and it is going to be an ongoing working relationship. He really is very honest and goes by the clock. I would continue to use him.
4,"My experience was kind of mixed. My husband actually supervised their visit. He thought they were good and asked them to do more work. I came home and I wasn't happy. The Big Deal was for a set number of hours and my husband wanted them to finish the work so we paid them for extra time. We had a crack in the living room ceiling and whatever he mudded it with, it didn't blend well with the other texture so it was a real obvious repair as opposed to what we were after. Some of the drywall mud had dripped onto the carpet. It just wasn't cleaned up after. In my mind, what I was thinking was a drywaller and drywaller tend to come in on a house that is not finished and they get to be pretty sloppy. But this was work being done in a finished home so I was expecting more. I was anticipating that after he fixed the crack and textured it we would be painting over it. I didn't expect to find a mess on the floor and have to do some clean up. My husband thought that they did a reasonable job. Not a great job but a reasonable job. My husband said they were late but it was justified."
5,"Kjell did a great job! He was able to do work the same day that I called. He was prompt, efficient and pleasant to work with. We will definitely use Kjell in future."
5,They were great. They were efficient. They were very fast.
1,"I called and emailed several times and he responded once, but never followed up and I was never able to schedule anything. I ended up exchanging the Deal for another one."
5,"Full time Servants were wonderful. They showed up on time and were amazingly polite. The spot in the ceiling was in a very awkard spot, and they managed to work it out. We have textured walls and they stayed over to make sure the work was dry before applying the texture. The finished product was amazing. I will use Full Time Servants again for any of our dry wall needs and would recommend them to anyone."
5,"All work was performed well , on time. I have Kjell on my schedule for other handy-man repairs."
5,"Kjell was courteous, prompt and efficient. Got the job done quickly while finding and implementing low-cost solutions. Also eager to show me how to do the repairs myself. I plan to have him do more work on my house."
5,No more leaks. New shower parts and walls look great!
1,"took my money, materials, never completed job"
5,"It was an Angie's List Big Deal that I purchased. It was great and I would highly recommend him. He was very professional, very quick and knowledgeable. I would absolutely use him again."
5,"The service went great; they were communicative and easy to work with. I had a short time frame and they were able to work me in. He missed a fine detail; I saw a corner of old paint still sticking out and it really should have been removed. I don't know why he missed that. He even went to the store to and from my work site to pick up some paint for me; he did not have to do that, so that's really working with me."
4,"I bought the $59 deal from Angie's List for two hours of handyman services. After some initial confusion confirming my appointment, Kjell came out and asked me for a list of what I wanted done. He made sure I got my two hours' worth of time out of him."
5,Kjell was terrific. I would definitely recommend him and will use him for all of the household repairs that may be needed in the future.
5,Everything was done correctly and in a very timely manner. The fee was more than reasonable.
5,"I had been told by more than one person that porcelain tile was tricky to drill through without cracking, so I decided to hire the work out. I needed the work done asap, and even though Kjell was scheduled up for the week, he was able to accommodate my tight schedule by working the job late in the afternoon. The job took about 45 minutes to complete. He used a hammer drill to make the holes for the screw anchors. He then completed the installation of the shower curtain rod and finished the job."
5,Kjell was great and even though we didn’t move forward with the job we will use Kjell for our Handyman needs in the future.
5,I was very pleased with the quality of the work. They cleaned up after themselves and gave me reasonable quotes on some future projects I was thinking of having done.
5,Very pleased all around.
5,He is awesome!!
5,Very good.
3,"The job did not go as anticipated. We had to stay on top of the work, which initially was rather mediocre. We were told that we were too particular, since we wanted the tiles to line up - imagine that!!! Also, anything negative that happened was the customer's fault and not the contractor's. We will never re-hire this contractor or recommend him to any of our friends or associates."
5,"Richard was fantastic. He has excellent communication, work ethic, and quality of work. We are very pleased with the work he did for us and will definitely use him again in the future. It was so nice to have this experience with him after having a bad experience with a previous contractor. I wish we had found Richard sooner. He installed and finished drywall including matching it up with existing plaster which you can’t tell was done like you can sometimes due to the difference in thickness of plaster versus drywall. He also did some carpentry work and painted."
5,Extremely well. Richard arrived on time. Was very professional. Completed the work on time. When necessary on design issues he asked me what I wanted or what I had envisioned for the space. My home turned out perhaps even more esthetically appealing than I knew it would. The new door handles and pulls make me very happy and add joy to my time in my kitchen. I would recommend Richard to anyone.
5,"Perfect! On time, fair, efficient , clean, polite, and got the job done."
5,It went great. Richard is excellent at whatever he does. Very meticulous and quality conscious. Very easy to work with. A very Knowledgeable and nice man
5,"The Deck reconstruction went smoothly even when at the mercy of February 2019's cold and rainy weather. Richard responded to my search promptly. He listened to what I wanted prior to beginning the job and made design suggestions as well. The job was started within weeks and completed in a timely manner with a few delays due to the weather. He hand picked clean, new lumber that had minimal knots. He hand picked new 6x6 beams even when the lumber store wanted him to use older wood. He rounded edges of many of the deck boards for smooth, safe design where the deck aligns with our above ground pool. He took extra care to leave our property presentable at the end of every work day. It was an extreme pleasure working with Richard. He is very friendly man as well as extremely talented handyman. He has good work ethics and meticulous in his work. I would recommend Handyman Unlimited for other handyman jobs."
5,"Richard and his son, as always, did a great job. They were very professional, and pleasant. We will hire them again; and when we sell our house, we will leave his name for the new buyers."
5,Richard did a fantastic job! Very professional and couldn’t have been a nicer guy. I would hire him again.
5,"We were looking for someone who could complete a job that another contractor had not finished, and called Richard after seeing a lot of positive reviews. One or two good reviews could be from family or friends, but many of them is usually a good indicator. And that was the case here. He was prompt and punctual, and did excellent work at reasonable prices. Once he was able to start, he worked on our job exclusively until it was completed. Collaboration with him was both easy and effective. As we get older, having a trusted group of resources becomes more and more important, and we feel that Richard is on that list. The next time we need a handyman, he'll get our first call. Highly recommended."
5,"Reviews of leak repairs must be provisional until proven by a hard rain. Nevertheless I am confident that Richard solved our problem and did it in an affordable and thorough manner. I had to wait several weeks for him to have an opportunity to do the work, but that is no doubt because he is good and has many clients. His work was thorough and I was informed of his progress and any additional problems that were discovered while the repair proceeded. Not only did he repair the rain damage, he traced the problem back to its source and made sure it would not happen again. His work was neat, professional, thorough, of the highest quality. He knows what he is doing. He also documented his work with pictures so that I understood what and why he did certain things. Should I need to, I will certainly use him again and I highly recommend him to anyone needing general handyman services."
5,"Far exceeded our expectations! Richard remodeled our downstairs walkout basement into a lovely rentable studio apartment with a kitchen and full bath, He created a beautiful living, bedroom, kitchen and bath area from a large open space. We couldn't be happier with the quality of work he does!"
5,Richard did a wonderful job on these tasks. He was very professional and personable. We plan to use him again for some larger outside tasks as soon as weather permits. Highly recommend.
5,"Richard did a great job! He arrived on time, got right to work, and even returned unused lumber for me, so I could get a refund for it. I would absolutely hire him again."
5,"Excellent! Richard has done many jobs for us over the years, including painting the house. He is creative, knowledgeable, and completely trustworthy, and his work is always of high quality."
5,"We had previously hired someone to remove popcorn ceiling and paint. They removed it but along the way damaged the sheet rock and said we needed certain areas that were a problem repaired by someone else. We hired Handyman Unlimited and they were incredible. The ceiling looks like glass that's been painted. We were in awe to see how it made a difference. Jenny also suggested we update the crown holding and that was perfect. We ask for some custom work also, a cabinet area built above what use to be a closet. Part of the closet now houses our refrigerator, we wanted a space beside it to be a pantry. Jenny made us a pantry exactly like we wanted, with a very finished look. We wanted a pocket door removed and Jenny suggested we widen the opening at the same time, great idea. She and Jason do not skip to a faster easier way they do everything 120%."
5,"Perfect....excellent work!! Reliable, honest, extremely knowledgable and trustworthy. Could not ask for a better handyman."
5,All the work took 7 days. Richard is a craftsman at his work. He is very knowledgeable in all aspects of home repair. He also gave us ideas on things we can do to help maintain our home.
5,Perfectly! Couldn't have asked for anything better.
5,"Mr. Byers was very responsive, listened to what I asked for and was on time every day. His professionalism was only out done by the quality of his work! From now on if I need something done I will call him."
5,"He did a great job. It was not an easy job as it entailed a lot of little jobs, i.e., plumbing, demolition, reconstruction, wiring and re-wiring, tiling, etc. He did not contract out any job. He, and his son, did it all. We would definitely hire him again. In fact, we plan to use him for another remodel job. He is very personable and definitely knows his craft."
5,Richard and his son did a great job. we love the new bathroom and have had many compliments on it. i would definitely hire him again; and would highly recommend him.
5,They arrived on time. They were friendly and professional. Reasonably priced. Look forward to working with them again.
1,"I called, got answering machine saying my call was important to them and they would call back. They never called back."
5,"Handyman Unlimited Richard remodeled our entire basement. This included installing drywall, trim, painting, demo bathroom, rearranged plumbing for vanity & commode & installed tile & flooring. He was prompt, professional & exhibited quality work. He cleaned up each day so that we had as least amount of debris as possible. He gave some really good suggestions on things we were undecided about. Also, after he finished the job he came back to repair some wall damages caused by a granite installer. We would definitely recommend Richard to others."

5,"Richard was excellent to work with. He is very detail-oriented, and did a fantastic job on our tiled backsplash (about 55sq ft). We will definitely use him on the future. Thanks, Richard!"
5,Richard was polite and very hard-working. He did a neat job and cleaned up after himself every day. I would definitely use him again.
5,"Extremely well; I completely agree with the other reviews. Richard has done many jobs for us over the years (including painting our entire house) and we are always pleased with his work. I very much appreciate his attention to detail and neatness, as well as his creativity in tackling complicated and involved jobs."
5,GREAT!! Richard evaluated and solved a problem for us. He cleaned up behind himself both times he was here. That is the mark of a good workman.
5,"They painted the entire door and when they were finished, it looks new. I can't say enough about how pleased I am at the work done and the price was very reasonable. Thank you Richard and son! You saved me so much money by not having to replace the entire door. I will definitely ask Richard to do more jobs as they arise."
5,"He was very nice. Very punctual, did a very neat job. Cleaned up his mess. Charges were fair and reasonable. I would definitely use him again and recommend him highly."
5,Richard was able to do the job with very short notice. He was accessible and responsive. Very friendly and professional. Did the job quickly and cleaned up afterwards. Very good quality job. Will definitely contact again for future jobs.
5,"The living room has a tongue and groove wood ceiling. It's vaulted and angled with no attic above it. I wanted ceiling fans and recessed lighting installed, but a couple electricians who came out told me the job was impossible. Finally, I found an electrician who came up with a strategy to install the fans and lighting so that the wiring was all tucked up underneath the ceiling -- no ugly wire molding. But the work involved carpentry skills. Paul Murrell (my electrician) and Richard devised a plan that required making a cut along the grooves in order to remove a board. He called Richard Byers to assist him. It was a complex job that no one else was willing to tackle. Together, Richard and Paul managed to do all the work in one day. Their work was meticulous! You can't tell which wood board was cut (they stained the edge to match the existing ceiling so it's invisible). It looks as if the house was designed and built with the fans and lighting. The price was more than fair for the amount of work involved. I'm so impressed and happy with the final result!"
5,"Richard is incredibly efficient and exacting- Other reviews say ""meticulous,"" and I agree. At the end of every day, Richard was sure to clean up and leave all areas neat. He allowed the kitchen to be as useable as possible. He made great recommendations and suggestions. Before adding molding to the ceiling, he had to remove 27 yr old wallpaper border. He did this easily and seemed to have the molding up in no time. I had some very plain, unfinished-looking areas on cabinets and walls that he enhanced with molding, as well. In order to install the backsplash I wanted, he had to take out a cabinet above the microwave so he did this, raised the microwave, and made a box for a future wine rack above the microwave with left-over room. He installed new backsplashes beautifully. Some of the cabinet doors were a bit crooked and the counters were not level. He fixed them, as well. Richard and an electrician friend of his installed canned lighting in the ceiling, added pendant lights, and changed out the chandelier. They also installed under counter lighting and moved outlets for more convenience. Incidentally, they also installed a ceiling fan in a bedroom. Richard has also done many other jobs for me. Recently, he installed a hot tub on my deck, replaced rotten boards, painted the deck, and secured it underneath for the weight of the tub. He installed new railings, as well. Richard power washed the area, including my deck cushions. Richard is as non-invasive as possible by being as quiet as the job allows and by being courteous in manner and approach. He is polite, well-spoken, and seems to enjoy challenging jobs. He is not passive in his thinking, but rather he is always problem-solving and engaged. He wants the customer to be happy with the job he has done. He is happy when he can walk away knowing his customer is satisfied-who wouldn't want someone like him working for them! Richard has family members who can help him when the job calls for more than one person ( such as installing a hot tub). His daughter is a handy-woman by profession and he has sons who help him at times."
5,He did great work and was very friendly.
5,"Once again, Richard did a perfect job as requested - and then some. He even provided some materials so I didn't need to buy extra. This is the third time he has done work for me and he has always been great. He is the best handyman I have ever hired."
5,Great. on time. great quality. very professional.
5,Beautiful work; I'm very happy with it. Thank you Richard !!!
5,"Richard is absolutely METICULOUS. He arrived daily at the time he said he would. He laid tarps from our front door all the way to the master bathroom so he could come and go without getting dirt into the house. He removed the tile from our shower and showed us exactly what the problem was that caused the leak and explained what needed to be done to fix it. It was very apparent that he is a master plumber/carpenter/handyman. He gave suggestions on what kind of tile to look for and how to match it to the original tile as best as possible. The job required that the tile be removed from the entire shower from waist height....down. Richard jack-hammered everything out all the way to the subfloor and showed us what was happening to cause the leak. He removed all of the rotting/molded wood and replaced everything in between the floors. He used the highest quality materials and explained to us every step and why he was doing it. He reworked the drain that was not draining properly. The previous installers had used ROOFING NAILS to nail down the cement board with no glue. Richard explained to us that a special type of screw was supposed to be used WITH a special kind of glue to keep the screws from coming out and cracking the grout (when the floor expands and contracts due to temperature changes). He showed us numerous other things that had been done incorrectly and showed us how he was addressing each issue. At the end of each day, Richard cleaned and shop vacuumed his way out of the bathroom all the way to the front door and left virtually no trace that he had been there. Richard came back at the end of the job and sealed the tile and grout. He was kind, courteous, and well spoken. Our shower looks even better than it did when it was first renovated and I know it will last a lifetime due the meticulous work ethic of this handyman. This was the most positive experience we have ever had with a home maintenance person. It was worth every penny to have this peace of mind. Richard is awesome and we highly recommend him. Jeff and Kathy Holden"
5,"I called the cell telephone number while Richard was out of town He returned my call promptly We discussed what services I needed at my home.When he returned to Phoenix we made an appointment for him to give me an estimate. We discussed the work needed and Richard came back the next morning to do the job. it took less than an hour, it was done quickly and professionally, Richard is personable, I would use his services again,"
5,"We did not use this provider; however, Handyman Unlimited was very professional and prompt in giving a bid on services. We would definitely use them in the future."
5,"The experience was excellent (the best we have had) the work was on time, on budget with done with great care and neatness. We had been referred to Richard by a friend and he was as advertised. We highly recommend Richard and have asked him to bid on another project and are looking forward to working with him in the future."
5,"You need to know that Richard is WONDERFUL. He remodeled our master bathroom in three weeks, never missing a day of work there, always giving it his best effort, always pleasant and kind. He gave us great advice concerning elements of the renovation, and took pride in every element of his work. The end result is an absolutely beautiful brand new bathroom that we will enjoy for years, and we are so thankful that we chose Richard to be the one to remodel it!!"
5,"You just cannot go wrong with Richard and his daughter. Period. He was out to our home quickly to examine the work to be done. Courteous, pleasant, neat, very focused and meticulous. Condition of his truck and work trailer bespoke professionalism. Takes great pride in his work. More than a handyman, he is a craftsman. He was prompt every day. He kept a very clean worksite and took great care to ensure that he did not damage the home interior in any way. He welcomed questions, no matter how ""dumb"", and he was extremely patient in explaining his procedures as he went along. The work took four days, and during that time I found additional honey-do items that were not on the original agenda. Richard cheerfully added those jobs without any qualms whatsoever. He was very careful to ensure that he closed doors, as our cat is an ""indoors cat"" with no front claws. The match between the color of paint and the existing siding was excellent. There were several other items needing attention at a later date, and Richard was freely providing advice on what I could do about them or what he would do if I hired him again. We have had our home for 17 years. I've had many repairs/upgrades done to the structure and appliances and HVAC. While I've dealt with some exceptional folks providing those services, Richard is at the top of the list. I expect to pay a higher price for top quality that lasts; with Richard I received top quality AND a very reasonable price. You simply cannot go wrong with this service--I already have another list for Handyman Unlimited! And I have that peace of mind knowing that whatever happens in the future, I do not have to wade through the yellow pages or Angie's List or word-of-mouth to find someone to handle the work. With complete confidence, I'll just give Richard a call."
5,Everything we discussed was addressed professionally.
5,"Richard is non-stop and I really like the way he does work, he is very clean and efficient and I wouldn't use anyone else."
5,"It went wonderfully. He is like full blast all the time; he never slows down or takes breaks. He’s amazing guy. The pricing is good. He is incredibly nice, an all-around good guy. He is very polite. He doesn’t waste any time and he’s extremely knowledgeable."
3,We did not get past the initial phone call because he said he was too busy and booked until summer and referred us to his daughter. He really seemed more interested in getting business for his daughter than anything else. We chose not to call her because she is not on Angie's List and we decided to call someone else.
5,"Richard is an absolute professional and joy to work with. He is utmost of meticulous, very detail focused and wants his work to be perfect! Which it is!!! I am very particular about how I want things done and Richard is more particular than I am which allowed me to relax about the entire project. We needed some painting done in addition to the tile work which we thought had been hired out to another contractor, that fell through. We asked if Richard if he could complete the work; though he was scheduled for another job he said he would make sure it would be completed either by him or his daughter Jenny. Jenny came and evaluated the project and gave us a quote that we felt was reasonable and she started the next day. Both Jenny and Richard's work is flawless. We have other projects we would like to consider for the future and we will definitely call on them to complete! Thank you!!!"
5,"Richard Byers worked in our home almost every day for several weeks. His daughter asisted him routinely during this time. They were very prompt and professional, and extremely nice people who were very easy to work with. We were completely comfortable during the entire process having them in our home alone. We were pleasantly surprised how clean their work was, especially involving the replacement of the popcorn ceiling. There was almost no dust involved. Their painting work was excellent, on ceilings and walls. Richard did an excellent job on the bathrooms, and we are very pleased with the tile work in all areas. He is very skilled in renovation work. One of the most important things to us was that virtually all work was done by Richard and his daughter, so we did not have to worry about dealing with a lot of different workers/service providers. As time went on, they became more like friends than just a service provider. Both my wife and I felt very comfortable asking any questions, requesting changes in the work, etc. and Richard was always polite and accomodating. He never answered our questions or requests in a condescending manner, which is something we have experienced with other service providers in the past. In summary, we would recommend Handyman Unlimited to anyone needing this type of work, and we had an excellent experience. We plan to use Handyman Unlimited again in the near future for additional work on our house."
4,"No work was commissioned since we needed the work done immediately, not in six months."
4,"The owner of Handyman Unlimited was busy doing other jobs and could not come when I called. He mentioned that he had taught his daughter Jenny, who works with him, and she could do job. We agreed to have her call me and I hired her. He taught her well, Jenny did a very good job."
5,Jenny came out and gave us an estimate for the work and then came back the next day and did the initial work. She returned once the grout had dried to finish the job and it looks great!
5,"Richard called before he came, he was punctual, and he completed the work easily. He clarified what he was going to do before he started. He has worked for me several times over the past five years on both small and large ""punch lists"" and has always been professional. He says that he tries to complete work on others' homes as he would want his to be done. He is very neat and he cleans up at the end of the day so that one would never know he had been there except that the work done looks exceptional. He is worth the wait that sometimes occurs because he is so busy. When he is actually working on a home, the homeowner would never know that he is busy because he takes his time to accomplish the job in the best manner possible. I highly recommend Richard Byers. You will not be disappointed!"
1,"See the details above in the ""What did the provider do"" section."
3,"He arrived promptly after we made initial contact. He gave us a quote & an estimate for cost. He also told us when the work would be done. However, he did not show up & when we called, he told us he was very busy & would have to delay our job. It was not a good experience. We would rather pay more for a repair & get the job done than to get the run around from a contractor. It makes us hesitant to find another repair person through your service."
5,"Richard and his helper (daughter jenny) was great. Did the work on time, made the drogues we discussed repaired all was focused on the job and finished all that was needed. He went beyond above!!!"
5,The worked was thoroughly completed and we are very happy with the results.
5,"RIchard quoted labor only for me so that I could purchase the materials I wanted. I had lots of questions about the projects which he answered patiently and thoroughly. Since I could not be at the house, I left him a key. He arrived when he said he would, did a great job with all projects and cleaned up after himself. He also gave me some great tips on projects I'm doing myself. I hope to get him to do more work for me soon. Very pleased!"
5,"We were thrilled with the work performed. Richard had integrity, was prompt and courteous. He cleaned up everyday of the job. He ensured that sealants dried properly before laying tiles on them. He made minor repairs throughout the house for us so quickly and efficiently. He insisted on completing the work before receiving any pay. My husband was a licensed contractor in the past and he loved everything Richard did. We are very confident that the job is now done right! I will definitely hire him again in the future. Thank you Angie's List for this referral!"
5,"Richard knows his business! He created an opening in the wall between my kitchen and living room that looks as though it has always been there. His carpentry and painting cannot be beaten, and he is well-mannered and well-spoken. He was not bothered by my curious beagle, and acknowledged him each time he came in. I was pleased with his professionalism. He always answered my questions about his process and progress kindly. I recommend his work highly."
5,"Richard has performed many jobs for me for the past four years. He has cut down trees, repaired my deck,put new railings around my deck, built a raised garden bed, painted the trim on my house and replaced rotten wood where necessary. He has also done maintenance on outside tools and he has power washed the house several times. He has replaced gutters that were chewed by squirrels and he has cleaned my gutters twice a year. He helped me design a front porch railing that was elaborate and unique and then he built it. Inside, Richard has worked on my bathrooms by changing the floors to tile, replaced toilets, and built frames for around my mirrors. He added chair railing, and has done some minor electrical work. He also repaired my indoor window shutters. No job seems too big or too small for him. He is extremely efficient and thorough and he cleans up so that you would never know he has been here.He completes work that would take other handymen a week in half that time. Everything is done with expertise. Richard's daughter occasionally helps and she is also very professional. I have no qualms about leaving him in my home and I usually just give him a key that he keeps until the job is done. I trust him completely."
5,"Richard was very responsive and did a great job. Timely with his estimate and with the work.. The refinishing was superior to the previous work done. The cleaning and washing were very well done. He also fixed other things that came up during the work, like the leak. I will certainly use him again and have recommended him to friends."
5,"Richard really helped us out of a jam this week when another drywall contractor who had given us the runaround for a week, finally fell through completely. With new kitchen countertops on order and with a short window until their install date, Richard was able to step in on short notice and install drywall in our kitchen. He estimated a very fair price for the job, showed up when he said he would, was obviously knowledgeable and experienced as he explained the steps in the process. He used the correct materials for a ‘wet’ area, thinking of details that we had not previously considered, and worked quickly and efficiently. He did a great job, and left the kitchen neat and tidy every day, which is no small chore when working with drywall! We are so grateful for his help on this project, and would definitely work with him again."
5,"We were redoing our kitchen and I was serving as the General Contractor. I was looking for a painter to remove the popcorn ceiling and repair drywall where a pantry was removed. I quickly learned that Richard could do everything and so I added lots of extra jobs to his list. He was dependable and very, very thorough. Whatever he did, he did very well and with professionalism. He gave suggestions and I felt like he was an expert in his field. He was very clean and neat and left the house having cleaned up whatever mess was made. I felt very comfortable leaving the house and not feeling I had to supervise. One day I called him from Sears to ask about the kind of ice maker line to purchase. After he installed the dishwasher he ran a cycle to make sure there were no leaks and the same with the faucet and ice-maker. I will definitely use him again. In fact, I am waiting on a quote for some outdoor repairs."
3,This was a case where I let myself get drawn in by all the positive hype I read about some of Richards previous jobs and trusted him because of that. I did not get him to break down individually the costs for the 4 different jobs I needed done but accepted a total estimate. When I decided to remove the 2 remaining jobs after he had finished the first 2 he only reduced his final invoice slightly from his original bid on the 4 jobs. I didnt argue as I was the one who failed to get him to break done the jobs individually by cost -but $120/hour for pressure washing and wall paper removal-come on man! Dont make the mistake I made -get a separate estimate for every single job you have Richard do and then get someone else to give you an estimate and I bet it will be a lot cheaper for the same average quality.
5,"This was a great experience. Richard called me when he arrived at my home. When I arrived he had already started on the project. He was able to salvage some of the railings and replace many of the others. He raised the canopy level on the porch by an inch. He took the time to explain that some of the replacement pieces need to dry before they could be repainted. He remained until he was sure that I understood the next steps. When he left, you couldn't tell he was there - other than the brilliant woodwork done on the porch. He IS my go to Handyman - period!"
5,"Excellent. Could not have gone better. Richard was prompt and considerate in his timing and communications. He stuck to his cost estimate and time frame. My one hesitation in recommending Richard is that he might get so busy, we'd have a hard time getting him back to do more stuff. He's that good!!!"
5,"Did not get very far, but my experience with Richard was definately a good one. I can only hope that he will be available when I revist the projects."

5,"This was my second time using Handyman Unlimited (Richard Byers) services. I was as pleased this time as I was the first time both in the quality of work and the overall cost. Both times I have used Richard's services, his daughter assisted him. This time his daughter assisted mostly with painting and did an excellent job. Richard was always on time, professional, attentive to details and delivered a quality product. I especially liked the fact that Richard would make suggestions on the work I needed to have done, but not in a pushy way. I appreciated his recommendations as he has been doing this type of work for years. I will definitely call on Richard for any future needs. In fact, I am having new front/back entry doors installed on Monday 6/11/12. Richard has already agreed to paint both doors after they are installed. I will contact him on Tuesday 6/11/12 to determine a date.I also have plans this year to paint the interior of my house. I will definitely contact Richard when I get ready to do that. One last comment. I do feral cat rescue and have several cats in my house as well as a colony of cats outside. This is a passion of mine and the cats inside the house absolutely cannot go outside. Richard was very sensitive to this and understands that any service he performs, such as the upcoming painting of the interior of my house, will most likely have to be done in phases. I have to secure the inside cats in 2 different rooms while painting is being done in the other rooms. I very much appreciate his sensitivity to my ""special"" needs."
5,"He also cuts our azalea bushes, fixes our appliances, and does anything else we need. He is very good. I give him an ""A"" overall."
5,"Absolutely awesome. Richard and his daughter were wonderful to work with. The remodel started thee weeks ago, every day I was amazed at the transformation! The baths were even cleaned at the end! They asked my input on everything they did. The even repainted areas when I was not pleased with MY paint choice. Richard even hung shades at no extra cost. His workmanship is superior! I knew he was the one to choose and am very happy!!!!! I have already recommended him to coworkers!"
5,"Richard is an amazing workman. He leaves no detail undone. He cleans up every day. He was here about 15 days to complete this job. I found him on Angies List. (joining was best thing I did) My words can not adequately describe all the work he did and the beautiful, wonderful bathroom I now have. I am handicapped and I can now - unassisted- use my bathroom/shower alone. Everything that I need for my shower is done- grab bars, in wall shelf, no lip on floor entry to shower - floor slopes into shower basin . Richard did so much more than I am able to describe. My finished project is everything I asked for and more."
5,"Professional and courteous, fair estimate, prompt and professional / very good quality work; highly recommended, would call again"
5,"He did more than I could even of asked him to do. I even gave him an extra $1,000 on top of what he charged. All of his work is amazing. He is honest and happy all the time. I wish we had more people like him in our area."
5,Very professional and nice.
5,Very professional and nice.
5,Perfect True professional A++
5,All work was completed on time. Great attention to detail and getting everything just right. Outstanding job. Estimate was inline with the actual cost. I have and would recommend this business.
5,"Richard was very pleasant, courteous, professional and knowledgable. He showed up on time every day and was very meticulous about the detail of his work, while doing his best to cause a minimal disturbance to the household. He cleaned up everyday and gave me routine progress reports and happily answered my questions and offered advice. On top of all of this his price was very competetive and unlike most contractors he provided an accurate estimate within a few days time! This experience is the very reason my family joined Angie's List! We researched about five different companies/people about the work based on reviews and ended up with fantastic work done at a very good price! I highly recommend Richard and Handyman Unlimited!"
5,"This company has worked for us a total of 3 times. The 1st time, I found the company on Angie's List and had them construct a handicap ramp for my husband who had just had a serious accident. I specified that I wanted the ramp to be removable after my husband;s recovery. Because I needed the ramp quickly, they gave this job top priority and got it done right away. Richard did a marvelous job and came back 9 months later to take it down when we needed him to. Next I asked for an estimate to have a complete bathroom overall- I wanted a 1960's long narrow bath to be gutted and become handicap accessible and I wanted a walk in shower. The completed job is beautiful and the price was excellent. There was a large amount of tiling involved: shower walls, decorative trim and a shower insert as well as the entire floor. Richard is very precise- he makes sure he gets it right. He had never done the type of sloped floor we needed in the shower and he did considerable research to do it correctly. (that part had me nervous because if the slope isn't correct there would be major problems. He did it perfect). I also appreciated how they cleaned up after themselves every single day. On his 3rd visit in the spring of this year, we had several small jobs done- fixing a door, taking down the ramp and storing it, etc. If you are in a hurry for a job to get done, be cautious: it WILL get done and done right, but maybe not on your time schedule. We will continue to call this company for other jobs."
5,"Richard came over to fix a leak. Thought he had it fixed, but it still leaked. He came back a second time, found the problem and fixed it. He then came over when we had a big rain to make sure it was not leaking. He only charged his original fee. Richard goes beyond what you would expect from a repair person. He is very professional. I highly recommend him. Ben Miller"
5,Services performed as agreed upon in a timely & professional manner.
5,"Very meticulous, makes everything right and I loved all of it! Completed it like it had never never been harmed. Daughter does painting and it was excellent."
4,"Richard was kind enough to go beyond his usual service area to give me an estimate on a variety of home repairs. He made me aware of a $40 fee at the time we first spoke. He went to the property and promptly provided me with a verbal quote of the estimate of his work (via telephone). However, he did not send me a written, detailed listing. While I appreciated his punctual response, I found the quote too high and lacking in specifics. Therefore, I did not choose to contract him to perform the work."
5,Excellent excellent job. Good work guys:))!!!
5,He is very prompt and polite. He is honest and dresses neat and clean. He does not waste any time. He will go and purchase supplies and come back and do the work and he is fast.
5,"Richard was prompt in getting back to me with the initial contact and then with the estimate. The estimate was provided on 6/19/11, and the work began the following day on Monday, 6/20/11. My punch list included both interior and exterior jobs. Richard was leaving for a trip on 6/20/11, and had informed me that his 2 adult children who work with him, would perform the exterior tasks for me on Monday, 6/20/11. His son called me first thing Monday morning and established a start time, and they showed up right on time. They were both very pleasant and professional. They began work about 9:30 am and finished around 3:30 pm the same day. I was very pleased with the work they did, the time it took them to complete the work, and the cost. As soon as Richard returns from his trip, he will contact me to setup a time to complete the interior jobs we discussed. I will submit a separate report when that work is completed. So far, I can say that I would, and will, use this service again in the future."
5,"Richard was great. He provided a very detailed estimate and did the work exactly as he said he would. In fact, in many cases he went above and beyond the estimate and did work that was not specified just because he saw that it needed to be done. He was on the job 100% of the time which was a plus for us when selecting him. His adult children work with him so they have the same work ethic as him. Have to say it took a few days longer than some of the bigger paint companies, but his scope of work is much greater and the quality and attention to detail was well worth the wait."
5,The work was professional and detail oriented and it was not an easy job on an older house to make everything fit.
5,"Exchanged calls, gave an estimate for the above. As Richard was doing the work I tried to stay out of the way but wanted to see what he was doing and how he was doing the work and to see the damage behind the obvious exterior damage. He and his son were very patient, covered the work in detail gave their opinion on what needed to be done and the cost of additional work if we wanted it done. Part of the problem was my delay in calling in the first place as the professionals we have called before Angie's list weren't. At least two are out of business but onward we go. Delay and the problems gets worse. I believe the problems addressed above have been fixed and the work is first rate. Found one additional nail in the driveway but the site was left very clean. Have other jobs to be done and we will give Richard the first call. Great Value."
5,"Richard did an outstanding job. He can repair anything. He repaired a door that others said could not be repaired. He is a true craftsman. If you want the job done right at a fair cost, he's your man."
5,Very well. We used his services before and knew what to expect. Richard is a very nice person to deal with.
5,"Richard came out to look at the job exactly when he said he would and called within the day with the estimate- excellent workmanship, gave helpful suggestions for the design and finished the work quickly knowing that we had a time issue. The ramp was completed in one day. We were thoroughly pleased with the project and would definitely use his company again."
5,"The experience was wonderful. He came out and listened to everything that I was wanting. He gave some really good helpful tips. He listened patiently and was right on time. Everything was wonderful but I hadn't budgeted for the $1,000. I only had budgeted $700 so I am doing a portion of the work myself and then I am definitely going to give him a call back to come and finish up. I really had a lot of confidence in what he was telling me. The estimate he gave was totally in line."
5,Everything went as planned. The job took the estimated time. The labor estimate was very close to final price and I thought it was a fair price. The materials that The Handyman purchased seemed somewhat high. I should have asked for receipts. I would say the work was exceptional. The Handyman pays a lot of attention to detail. I would call him again.
5,"Glad I found Richard. This was a project that I thought I might be able to do myself. I am certainly glad I did not take it on. After Richard tore into the project, we found electrial outlets had to be moved, heating ducts had to be moved and the door opening had to be cut just right. There is no way I could have done it. Richard did a first class job. He did the construction, electrical, pumbing, everything. He cleaned up each day. He was right on with his quote for the job. I would highly recommend this company."
5,"He is fantastic. Others in the know who have seen his work have agreed that his craftsmanship is superb. He is reliable, communicative, upfront, and very talented at what he does."
5,"They did an excellent job and we were very pleased with the service. The thing I like most about this contractors is, that he can do everything. He did so much work and it is all great. He was here a lot and the whole time he was pleasant to have around. I would recommend him based on the quality of his work and his prices are reasonable as well."
5,OVER THE YEARS I HAVE USED THIS COMPANY FOR ALL MY HANDYMAN NEEDS. THEY DO EVERYTHING FOR ME. I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISSATISFIED WITH THEIR WORK. THEY DO A GREAT JOB.
5,Very nice work.

5,"They were professional, dependable, affordable and friendly."
5,"Our 30 year old forced air furnace was costly to run and not efficient. From estimate to installation and a follow up visit to explain the finer points of our system, everyone was courteous, hardworking and reliable. We use Williamson's for service for all our heating and cooling needs. They are highly recommended."
5,"The service was excellent, came the next day, at the right time, knew the problem and fixed it immediately, exterior wiring issue that was repaired and got fixed."
5,"Rob the owner was very polite and honest , answered all my questions and concerns. His crew Daniel,mike,and Walter right on time very professional and outgoing,every step of the way was explained. They went above and beyond kept everything cleaned no messes . I overall would recommend Williamson’s heating & cooling to anyone that’s looking for an amazing honest local company and his team of wonderful employees.If u want the job done right the first time then Williamson’s heating & cooling. Thank you team"
5,"Williamson's installed the first HVAC system in my house in 1996. I got 23 years of operation out of it, with very few problems. Williamson's did all of the yearly service and the minor repairs that were invariably needed due to the age of the system. I hired them to replace the system and to replace the ducting in my house. They handled the complete transaction, from the initial inspection and estimate, through the installation and the follow-up very professionally. The installation was done with a minimum of disruption, and done very diligently. The crew was courteous and professional. They took care to protect my floors and walls, and cleaned up at the end of every day. During the replacement of the ducting in my attic (which is not a fun thing to do!), they accidentally caused some damage to my house. After the installation was completed, they immediately followed-up with the repair of the damage and provided a contract letter to indicate that if any other latent damage is discovered, they will accept responsibility and repair. I could not have asked for better service throughout the whole process. I have a long history with Williamson's and have always been completely satisfied with their service. They are honest and forthright and do excellent work. I have always found their prices to be reasonable. They may be a little more expensive than some other HVAC contractors, but the quality of their systems and their service is worth the cost. I highly recommend them."
5,"Absolutely superb response and service! Now our ""go-to"" company for HVAC and electric needs. Outside A/C unit malfunctioned Friday night. Called 1st thing Sat morning (8ish), received call within an hour for expected arrival time (noon), tech (Dave*) called and arrived a little before noon, diagnosed problem and buttoned up unit within 45 min. Reasonable labor rates given a weekend overtime situation in 100+ degree weather. *Professional, courteous, extremely knowledgeable and personable to boot!"
5,"The people at Williamson are outstanding from the office person to the installers. We have never had any service comparable to the service by the Williamson crew. They were fantastic and very professional in every aspect. The four installed: Quincy, Chris, Rene, and Devon were great, super attitude, very respectful of our property, did a great install....very professional. It has been one week today since the install and all seems to going well. We are very pleased with Williamson's and would highly recommend them."
5,Work was done well and cleaned up as they worked.
5,"We called Williamson's on a Saturday morning, and Walter (service technician) came out that day. Problem diagnosed and the system back in operation that day. A follow-up visit today made all the necessary adjustments to make sure the system runs smooth and healthy through the rest of the summer. So -- initial install = great job; service call = great job."
5,Repair was done quickly and efficiently
5,"I needed to have the work done in the spring because the wiring was also ruined and it controlled my swamp coolers as well. The technicians checked that the furnace worked (as did I), but I didn't really use it until more than six months later. It didn't seem to be working as well as I hoped, so I called Williamson's who promptly scheduled the service manager to come out. He looked at the furnace and told me that it was missing a part (to hold the filter) and further that it had not been sealed off properly. I was astounded at his honesty, although I shouldn't have been, because all of my interactions with this company have been extremely positive (unlike virtually every other heating and cooling company I have ever had). He also diagnosed and fixed a squealing noise that sometimes appeared when the furnace was running (furniture partially blocking a duct). They had to order the part, and their excellent technician, Walter, came out, installed it and sealed off the bottom of the furnace (which required climbing into a very tiny space). He did a fantastic job!"
5,"My existing air conditioning unit was old, noisy, and used R-22 refrigerant, which was becoming very expensive to acquire. I decided to update the A/C and furnace ahead of an outage in the worst of summer. I put out for three bids. Williamson's was the most professional of the three when it came to evaluating the job and providing the bid. The proposal was clear and concise, and the bottom-line number quoted was exactly what I ended up paying. There were no hidden fees or surprise extra charges. The installation was performed across the span of two days, which means that it was properly scheduled and not rushed (given the amount of work to be done, a one-day install is a questionable proposition). The two installers -- Josh and Randall -- were professional, courteous, and very hard-working young men. Their attention to detail was very good. The job is now complete. Today was when the owner of Williamson's came out to do a final post-install inspection of the work to make certain all was done properly. The professional nature of the dealings with Williamson's made the entire experience a positive one. In an industry with many who seek to make a quick dollar and leave, I found the opposite to be true with Williamson's ... they strike me as straight-up, professional business people. That is a very good thing."
5,They knew exactly what was wrong and fixed it. They cleaned the unit completely and explained to me everything they were doing. They diagnosed the problem and told me what part it needed and how much it would cost. It went just like they said. Very nice service repairman. I promised to hire them to come and service my air conditioner compressor in March.
5,Excellent. Very good follow up service.
2,"Poorly. The initial appointment was great. The salesman showed up and appeared to be very professional and knowledgeable. I knew they would be finalists based on reputation and the quality of the initial consult. The problem is that I never received the quote, despite letting them know that I wanted to start the work within a week or two (it was very hot outside still). I called back after two weeks and was told that I would receive my quote that day. Two weeks later, I went with a competitor and ended up replacing both heat pumps. Two months later, I'm still not in receipt of a quote."
5,They showed up on time and did a great job! We have used them several times and they are always there when they say they're going to be and always do a good job. They are very knowledgeable and informative and I would and have highly recommended their services to others.
5,"We had previously called another heating company who spent over an hour trying to diagnose the problem. They finally came back with an estimate of over $1,000 for repair but strongly recommended a new furnace. We then called Williamson (based primarily on their Angie's List rating) and the experience was great. They came out immediately, diagnosed the problem within 15 minutes, had the part in stock, and installed it the next morning. Great service and I would recommend them highly."
5,"I decided I wanted an installer that had been approved for the Tucson Electric Power (TEP) rebate program. This is a wonderful way to ensure that you are getting a top notch installation, which is critical for a system to work at peak performance. Hence, I checked the TEP website and got a list of authorized dealers. I then crossed referenced those dealers with the Angie's List top contractors and selected three to bid on the job. Needless to say, I selected Williamson's. Williamson's lived up to their reviews. Initially, Wally came to test my old system for the TEP rebate. After filling up the condenser with refrigerant, the system tested OK for the maximum rebate - $850. Williamsons also gave me an Angie's List discount and a discount for a cash payment, which made their price the best of all the bids. With the refrigerant added, the system limped along until the following week when Wally returned with an assistant to do the job. They easily handled a couple of minor glitches and completed the job as promised with no evidence (except wonderful AC) that they had even been there! TEP is sending an inspector next week to confirm that the job was done as they specified for maximum efficiency. I am completely comfortable that I received the best possible installation and will have a worry free AC and heating system. I highly recommend Williamson's and the TEP program."
5,"I have had Williamson's working on my A/C Heating unit for about six years and knew that eventually it would have to be replaced, and that time came this August.. Over the years I developed a trust in their expertise as their service calls were always on time and very professional. Dave came out on 27 July and told me that it is time to start thinking of replacement as the one of the coils is shot and is leaking Freon badly, 4 1/2 pounds in the last two months. I asked Dave to work up a proposal for me and I had it the next day. I also got three other proposals. Williamson's proposal was not the lowest but within $200.00 of the lowest so I decided to go with Williamson's because of the trust factor knowing that they would handle this promptly and in a professional manner. Made my decision on 30 Jul and signed the contracts. They even included a free two year maintenance plan at the contract signing. The unit had to be ordered and was scheduled to be installed on 10 Aug. The wait was not an issue since my current unit was working and Dave would keep it going at no cost to me until the new unit is installed. On 10 Aug John Paul and Devon arrived at 9:30, as promised, and removed the old roof-top unit and installed the new unit, explained the operation of the new unit, answered all my questions and cleaned up the work site and were gone by 12:45. It could not have gone better. John Paul and Devon were very knowledgeable and very professional not only in the way they did their work but the way they conducted themselves in their interaction with me and my wife. In fact , over the years with Williamson's, every technician that came out to work on my A/C unit was very professional in their work but also treated me, the customer, with respect. That is important to any customer. Their entire staff is professional and easy to talk with. All in all I would definitely hire them again and highly recommend Williamson's to anyone."
5,"The staff at Williamson is a great group of people to install and maintain your AC equipment. We had a defect in one of our units, Williamson's staff ordered the part and responded the day the part arrived. I cannot recommend them enough."
5,"What a pleasure it was to work with this company! They came out quickly to provide an estimate, gave me estimates on two options (either they provide the heat pump system, or I do), and did the work within the next few days. Every person I talked to was pleasant and professional. Both the estimator and the installers arrived when they said they would. The installers explained what they would be doing and then did it, including taking away two old nonfunctional units. They cleaned up and before they left showed me how to operate the system. For years I have been trying to find a heating and cooling company like Williamson's! Unlike all the other companies I have used, this was a positive experience from start to finish. I highly recommend them and will use them for all my heating and cooling needs!"
5,"On 2/03/ 2015 Mr. John Paul Kammeyer came to our house for an estimate and he arrived on time. He took all the necessary measurements, answered with patience and knowledge to our many, many questions and discussed with us, in detail, the equipment options, the installation, the warranties, the TEP program and answered every question we had and more. After two days he emailed the estimate, followed by a hard copy in the mail. Of course, after we got the estimate we realized that we had many more questions which he addressed entirely during our phone conversations. What I want to emphasize is his work ethic, professionalism and a deep, deep knowleadge of the equipment, functionality and the science behind all of this. He is a very honest individual, warm, willing to help, and he encouraged us to call him each time we have a question. There is nothing fake about him, and what he says and promisees it is exactly what is going to happen. He had never tried to deceive or push us. On 2/10/2015, after we had a clear picture of what we want and the cost involved, we went to the office and signed the contract. Everyone at the office was very courteous and helpful. The work was scheduled for 2/16/2015. The crew of four people arrived on time and split because each person had a specific, designated job to do. The installation team was led by Devon who is a very knowledgeable and competent person. The next day a crew of only two people was necessary to continue and again they showed up on time. They once more worked the whole day toward finishing the job. During the installation Mr. Kammeyer came by to observe the progress and intervene if it were necessary. The job was finished on 2/18/2015 and the work was clean, very detailed and proficient. Devon explained how each equipment functions, gave us the manuals, instructed us in programming the thermostat and of course answered many of our questions. Him and his team were very professional, courteous and hard workers. After the final test was performed and sent to TEP, Devon was able to tell us that TEP approved $850.00. Williamson's Heating and Cooling deducted this amount from the final price listed above before billing us. On 2/25/2015 Mr. Kammeyer came for a final inspection and to address any additional questions or concerns we might had. We are extremely pleased with our choice of contractor and the work they've done. We recommend Williamson's Heating and Cooling to anyone who wants a trustworthy, qualified contractor."
5,"We first hired Williamson's Heating and Cooling to take care of our HVAC when we purchased our house in 2000. We had two air conditioners and two furnaces, the original systems from when the house was built in 1991, and Dave did a great job of keeping them both running well despite their age. We decided to replace them with energy efficient units to reduce our monthly costs as well as take advantage of TEP rebates. Williamson's did a fantastic job all around, from explaining the benefits of upgrading, to testing and installing the systems, to getting us the highest rebates possible. Devon and his crew were excellent; very easy to work with and the new systems look spotless - they did a lot of extra cleanup of both areas before installing the equipment. We highly recommend Williamson's Heating and Cooling - it's a great company to work with!"
5,"I am totally satisfied with the work performed by Williamson's Heating & Cooling. John arrived on time and informed me of the process involved before he began. The job, from start-to-finish, was problem free. I really trust this company. When i make the switch to AC, I will be giving them a call!"
5,Very thorough. He took his time in the inspection. He found that the tenants from h*** had shoved newspaper in the heating vent. He told us where we could buy filters. We bought an annual system wellness contract
5,"I first started out doing research on which brand of split-type AC I wanted; then from Mitsubishi's web site I found which certified providers they had here in Tucson. From there I went straight to Angie's List and reviewed what the members had to say about each... Based on that read I selected Williamson's. Selling the system was not needed as I knew what I wanted, I just wanted to discuss the system (and get a quote) before I hired them for the job. John Paul was prompt and very professional... The information he provided and his non-pushy approach was enough for me to sign up to get it done, which just happened to be the very next day. Wally and Bill showed up around 10 am and wrapped up around 4:30 pm. They were both very professional and down right nice guys. I directed them to the rooms that the units were to go in and they took it from there. It was clear that this wasn't their 1st rodeo... as far as I could tell they had a game plan and pulled it off without any hiccups. Once completed they even painted the conduit covers with paint I had left over. They cleaned up everything and even washed the windows... other than having a great new system installed, one would never even know they were here. Wally and Bill spoke very highly of Williamson's as a company, which was great to hear; they are a credit to Williamson's and I expect I'll be adding another split-type AC to our master br in the months ahead and Willianson's will get the call. They even did a check on my main AC system while they were here. I am very pleased! One last thing... I was just kidding about them washing my windows. Cheers!"
5,"We have 2 AC units on our house. The old units had been in place about 13 years. We were dreading the day the units needed to be replaced and had been nursing them along the past 3 years, replacing parts here and there, hobbling by. It became evident it was time to replace them when both units ceased within a few days of each other.I had 3 companies come out to bid. We wanted someone withthe right combination of experience and equipment. We had done some research of AC brands and liked all we?d found about American Standard. In the end we went with Williamson's Heating & Cooling. (I found them on Angie?s List and had no prior affiliation). All the folks at Williamson?s are very professional, knowledgeable and friendly - and they were able to qualify us for TEP rebates most other companies cannot get through the ?CheckMe? program. (Honestly, their prices BEFORE rebates were very competitive!). Robbie (the owner) came out to give the estimate. I did not even realize until a half hour into the conversation that he is the owner ? a very unassuming, nice man who knows his business. The installers, Devon and Alan were also very professional and friendly and were happy to answer all of my questions. They worked very efficiently over 2 days to install both units. The new 17 Seer American Standard units are impressive and I swear I am feeling airflow that did not exist before! I am excited to finally see the efficiency increase and our utility bills decrease! Based on my experience with Williamson's Heating & Cooling, I highly recommend them."
5,"I was thoroughly impressed with the company, from the moment that I called to receive a quote and schedule the service. Williamson's provided a next day appointment. While there was a large window for the service, 1-4PM, the company called to inform me that the technician was running ahead of schedule and could be there earlier. They provided me with a 30 minute lead time to get home, they were waiting when I arrived. The service took no more than an hour and a half, the technician, Andy, was polite and respectful. I would recommend them in the future."
5,"Jean Paul did a great job on the estimate, recommending a unit that would provide the best Seer rating without replacing my heater. He provided an itemized list with the proposal. The only complaint I have is the installers thought the unit was to stay on the ground when the proposal stated it should go on the roof, but that issue was resolved before the guy with the crane left. Still, the installers should have had a copy of the work order with them. Not every item listed was performed but I trust the installers had their reasons. I did ask that the unit run as quietly as possible and Williamsons did well on accommodating me. They sent Wally and Allen out and they muffled the noise the air turbulence created in the return duct, metered it to be sure I was getting the right air flow, pulled out the motor on the heater, cleaned off the dust on the heater motor, and added foam around something there. It made a difference."
5,"changed air filters checked coolant level, and air pressure"
5,Went well and has worked well for 7 yrs
5,"We did have to pay the weekend rate, but we were happy to do so, given how hot it was. The cost was reasonable, and the repairs were quickly performed. We were very happy with the service and will definitely use Williamson again!"
5,"Both our zoned units as well as a new hot water heater work GREAT!!!!! Granted it's only been a few days! But I can not speak highly enough about the customer service ""We are impressed"" YES I would highly recommend this company, and NO....we are not related ....just a great recommendation from our realtor JC."
4,"Although I have been happy with the work done under my service contract, Williamson's is consistently unresponsive when it comes to other matters. For example, I have called them on different occasions about a bathroom ceiling fan, a replacement thermostat, and some minor duct modifications. I leave a message and am promised that someone will call me back, but no one does unless I nag them for several days. I have also tried leaving a message with my service technician when he comes for his semi-annual visits. He promises to follow up, but never does."
5,The work has always been great! They have been able come out after hours to assist with our needs.
5,They did a good job. I was happy with their work. The repair of the thermostat was included within a maintenance plan with them and there was no additional charge.
4,"They did a good job and I liked them very much. They are good, but they are little expensive."
5,"INSTALLATION WENT WELL ACCORDING TO THE TENANT. THE INSTALLERS DID A VERY EFFICIENT AND CLEAN JOB. THE HOT WEATHER, WHEN IT COMES, WILL DETERMINE IF THE UNIT IS AS GOOD AS I THINK! THE ENGINEER AND I HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS UP FRONT ABOUT SIZE (THE OTHER TWO ESTIMATES WERE FOR THE NEXT SIZE UP,) BUT JOHN PAUL CONVINCED ME THE SIZE WAS RIGHT!"
4,"The service technican was on time, friendly, courteous, and knowledgable. He told us what he checked and why and what he found."
5,"Great service, wonderful technician! Couldn't be happier! The furnace is working well now and doesn't have the annoying noise that les us to call them in the first place. They replaced two parts (inducer fan and blower wheel) and did a cleaning. Manny was our tech and is a great guy, very knowledgeable and thorough. Highly recommend Williamson's!"
5,"The old wall AC unit went out in our guest house and we decided to install a mini-split system to replace it after we had done our homework. We called Williamson to do an estimate, based on their good ratings with the BBB and Angie's list and we were not disappointed! The installed price was well within the reasonable range for the unit we needed, the installers arrived on time and did a fabulous job on the installation. That same evening, the unit started to leak water (we assumed the drainage was blocked for some reason). We called their 24 hour service line and agreed we could wait until morning to have it looked at. Their guys arrived early the next morning, apologizing for the problem and fixed it quickly (yep, clogged drain line!). No problems since.... We are very happy with the unit and Williamson's! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone!"
5,They did excellent work. They were very punctual. They were very communicative in regard to what to do and in fixing some of the issues that I had. They were very thorough.
5,"Our house was built in 1963. The new $70 / 70 cfm fan didn't quite fit in the space of the old fan, but the technician was able to modify the space and adapt the duct work. The new fan works just fine, but is a bit noisy. I don't remember if Williamson's offered us the option of a quieter fan. We would have been willing to spend more if one were available."
5,"We have used them for a number of years, and they have always been honest. We would use them again, and we would recommend them."
5,Installed quickly and cleaned up after work. Workers were polite and courteous. Unit was installed as quoted and looked great.
4,"We first visited their office on S Alvernon Way. Then we met them again at a home improvement show. Our decision was based mostly on price. The visit to their Alvernon office was not impressive. The receptionist could not help us with our questions. The sales person was busy on a telephone call in a back room. After a few minutes, we left without being helped. As we were leaving the parking lot to merge onto a busy street, the sales person ran up beside our car and tried to wave us down. This was not safe or professional. During the home visit, we felt the technician's emphasis on replacing our complete system was slightly heavy handed."
5,THEY GO BEYOND WHAT WAS EXPECTED-EVEN CHECKED OUT MY WATER HEATER.
5,They gave me great info on my current system. They didn't try to sell me a new system even though my current one is old. I feel they were honest and straight forward with me. I will definitely work with them again in the future. They were very thorough. Both my family and I use them for all of our needs.
5,Williamson's Heating & Cooling did an all around fantastic job. We had a really big problem with our ceiling and they came out very quickly with no hassle. The high quality or their work made us very happy and we highly recommend them.
5,THE MAN THAT COMES OUT IS VERY COURTEOUS AND NICE. HE TAKES HIS TIME AND ALWAYS HAS A NICE CONVERSATION WITH ME BEFORE HE LEAVES. THEY ARE JUST A WONDERFUL COMPANY.
5,Very satisfied!
5,Excellent service
5,Obviously very well.
5,EXCELLENT. great service
5,He did a good job.
5,Great job start to finish.
5,See above.
5,Very good.
5,Very good.
1,"Johnathan Delgado (don't know who Jesse is) assured me that the company was licensed and insured and that he would email the paperwork. When asked again, he said ""I'll send them tomorrow""... As he could never provide the Condo association with the documents, he made me waste 2 weeks waiting for him to do it. SO DISRESPECTFUL!"
5,"I was very pleased. Jesse was on time, did great work. Absolutely would call him again."
5,Falero did an awesome job at fixing our sink and installing a new quality disposal. Mike was amazing to talk with and walked us through each step. I can’t say enough about these guys and their work ethic and sterling quality of their work. I would not only recommend them to anyone but I would use them again in a heartbeat!!!
1,"Vendor is not licensed as a plumber per Miami Dade BCCO database. He arrived to work in our building which requires license and insurance and chose to register as a guest not a vendor to avoid this issue. With that said, he seemed nice however he vistited unit 2 times and each time failed to fix issue. The first visit he arrived with no tools or inclination to do more then look at the unit and report it fixed (which it was not) to the property management team. My experience overall was POOR. Each time he tried to convince me the issue was resolved when it was not. It has now been 30 days and I still have no functioning shower in my unit. I would not recommend hiring this firm without a defined scope and confirmation that they are licensed and insured to do plumbing work in Miami."
5,"Highly recommend. They came same day, super friendly, fast and cleaned up after."
5,They are absolutely amazing.
5,"The quality of work was excellent. They were the best plumbing I've got. They were timely, the quality of the materials was good, nice customer service, nice guy, and excellent service."
5,Mike was great. We had an emergency and he helped us right away.
1,Went over my list with them. Was professional and indicated I would receive an estimate of cost. Never heard from again and it's been over two weeks.
4,All work was done well and efficiently.
5,"Fantastic! I would definately hire this contractor for another project. I received a fair quote and was able to discuss the details. I was able to easily schedule my visit. I received email communication to confirm the visit. The technician arrived right on time and, even though he was working outside, he wore a mask the whole time. Justin K. was clean, respectful and professional. He knew what he was doing and got the job done quickly. The final bill was less than the estimate so that made me very happy. Highly recommended!"
1,He never got back to me with an estimate. Not even after I texted him to see if was interested or not.
5,The handyman had obviously done his research and arrived with everything he needed and knew how it should be assembled as well as the local codes.
5,Showed up on time. Work completed in a timely manner.
5,Kevin our tech was very professional and personable. He was able to complete the work without issues and we are very satisfied with the job. Communication from the office was great. We knew who was showing up and when he would be here. Great experience from beginning to end.
5,"They were wonderful. they were on time, didn't mess around, and very professional. I will have them come back nest Spring and I will continue to use them. The Office Manager, he responded immediately to my emails and calls."
5,"Unbelievable! Beyond impressed with quality of service, and the technician that arrived, very punctually was very knowledgeable and polite. Being a homeowner for approximately 10 years, I have dealt with quite an assortment of contractors. Mr. Handyman has gained my trust after this experience, especially after calling multiple contractors with a state of urgency, all of whom replied they ""may be able to get someone out next week""... Mr. Handyman dispatched a tech the next day! I will not hesitate to call again, THANK YOU!!!"
5,"Eric did a phenomenal job repairing our deck and was a joy to talk to. The work he did speaks for itself, and he is obviously is skilled at what he does, but what was also great was that he offered to do additional repairs outside the initial project scope. I would definitely hire him for future deck repair and woodworking needs again."
5,"Awesome. Bill did some of the same work for me last year, so it’s nice that they try to keep staff you’re used to do the jobs needed, if possible."
5,Very well. The service was able straighten and reattach a long length of siding blown off and reattached siding tat was loosened. The serviceman arrived earlier than estimated and completed the work quickly.
5,Mr Handyman did good job considering the circumstances. My mailbox was knocked down but the ground was froze. I was provided with a sound temporary solution. Plan on using Mr Handy man for the permanent installation.
5,"The Service Technician was extremely professional and paid close attention to our needs. He advised us that the screening did not need to be replaced, but only needed to be “re-seated” in the door frame (That saved us the cost of a new screen). I would recommend Mr Handyman of Waukesha to anyone for household repair."
4,Not completed yet. Was unable to repair. Will be replacing whole unit
5,"Great! Ron Marish was polite, pleasant and completed the job quickly."
5,It went well. It has been over two weeks and no mice. David was very professional and did a good job. He cleaned up after the job was done. I would definitely hire them again.
5,I could not be more satisfied with Mr. Handyman of Waukesha! Bill came to do the evaluation and it was clear he knows home repair. He is personable and I felt I could trust him - was glad that he was assigned to come back for the repair work. I also appreciate their flexibility - Bill advanced the project to the point where I can do finish it with the painting. Jessica in the office was great with communication. I have finally found a reliable solution for home repairs I can't or don't want to do myself - I highly recommend them.
5,"Great responsiveness, got work done relatively fast. And quality was very good as well. Very positive experience."
5,"Great! They were timely, professional, and affordable."
5,It went very well! Eric Glorioso was very professional and diligent with his work. Let Eric know that he hasn’t noticed yet. He will know what I mean.
5,"very well. Our handyman, David, did a great job. He was very efficient and completed the job in a reasonable amount of time. Do thank him."
5,"EXCECEPTIONIAL! Work was done as estimated. Removed all waste, and vacuumed. Professional work. Will hire for more projects!"
5,Everything was great. Professional and polite. Fast response times. Fixed both of the issues we had. Didn’t price shop so I’m not sure if they’re competitive price wise but we were okay with what was charged.
5,"Kevin Lucht was excellent. His work was top notch. He was professional, considerate , timely and a very kind man. The coordinator Carry was great at her job ...kept me informed and answered all questions I had during the process. I would highly recommend and will be calling again!"
5,The quality of the repair was perfect! It looks now completely like it was before Amazon truck hit it; no-one even would notice a difference.
5,"Very well! They were professional, on time, and did a fabulous job! I absolutely loved the finished product and would hire them again in a second!"
5,"I was very pleased with the responsiveness of both the office and the technician, Bill. I was kept informed every step of the way and the job was completed in a timely matter and with professionalism. I never used a handyman service before and am not able to compare price and rate the cost, I know enough that I will use Waukesha Mr. Handyman again."
5,"The entire process was excellent. We highly recommend Martin at Waukesha and Milwaukee County North Handyman, Supurb."
5,It went very well and timely. Extremely satisfied and will hire again for different projects.
5,All went well. will monitor if leak has stopped and will have them return to replace drywall..
5,"It went great. The technician, Bill Andersen, did a terrific job scraping/painting the garage. He went above and beyond in numerous ways (e.g., cleaning the gutters on the garage so they look brand new, meticulous scraping, making suggestions that ended up improving the look of the garage). He also replaced the leaf guards on the gutters around our house and did some other repairs on some of the trim on the back porch. Throughout, he was an excellent communicator, showed up on time, worked hard while he was here, and cleaned up the work areas. I couldn't have asked for a more skilled or professional technician. This was our second job with Mr. Handyman of Waukesha and North Milwaukee. Will definitely use Mr. Handyman again. Also, their prices were competitive, given the high quality work that they do."
1,I rated them F because there was no follow-up to my initial inquiry.
5,Took longer than expected but good job.
4,Price I paid was more than quoted but the job was well done and of all the contractors I contacted they were the most responsive. Very up fronT with pricing and I like they send a picture of your contractor before he comes to your home. Very communicative and professional!
5,"The job was more complicated than expected due to age of pocket doors and settling of house and took more time to complete. Ralph the technician was very knowledgeable and efficient given the more complex job. He completed the work in a very professional manner and was friendly and courteous. Mr Handyman's hourly costs were somewhat higher than I expected along with an additional $70 service charge, but Ralph did an excellent job completing the work in 4.5 hours."
5,Everything went great! Don took everything into consideration when figuring out what needed to be done before starting the job. The job went faster than expected. Don did a fantastic job and I would recommend for any job needed to be done. Thanks again.
4,The carpenter had to run home to get his compressor which delayed the start and had to come back to the house after the project was done to pick up his cell phone charger that he left behind. The work itself was just fine.
5,Excellent job. Would use them again.
5,Technician was on time and work was done in a very professional manner.
5,Went well the man they sent ( Jerry) was very professional and kept the area very neat. I would ask for him again his work was outstanding
5,The work was done quickly and with precision. The repaired area is matched perfectly to the existing drywall and texture. There is no sign of the original cut out.
5,Dennis was great. Sent me a text right away and asked for photos then quoted me a very fair price. Set up a time a few days later to come out and did the initial repair and came back the next day and did all the finishing work. Very personable and professional too.
4,"slight scheduling issue other than that work man was extremely polite and work performed was satisfactory. front door seems ready for winter weather. Job involved removing door, sinking door hinges deeper and evenly, striping one side of door casing and installing a new door sweep."
2,Had an appointment scheduled and got a call and left a message on the Friday before to cancel the appointment. I had to call back to find out why and the carpenter quit and they had no one to do the work.
4,Very Poor. Didn't want the job. Slow to get back with me but honest.
5,Excellent job! Looking forward to working with Justin again on my next project. Hanging pictures on my wall.
1,wanted to be prepaid in advance via estimate--not interested
4,it went as best it could on the repair
1,"The guy called 20 min. before the appointment to cancel, by which time I had already rearranged my schedule for the day to meet with him. He made excuses about his worker calling in sick or something and when I noted that that was not my fault he copped a very rude and unprofessional attitude to the point where I simply terminated the phone call. I would NEVER spend money with these people. RUN AWAY."
1,"We hired Mr. Handyman to complete a drywall repair. We had two spots in the house that plumbers cut out for repairs. I called and was surprised that they gave me an estimate over the phone and scheduled the appt to do the work right then. I went with it because I wanted the job done and the price seemed reasonable. First off the handyman showed up to do a drywall repair and did not have any drywall or supplies. Why would you show up with nothing? He had general tools but no drywall. So the first day he spent 3-4 fours cutting the spots out. They charge over $100/hour. So four hundred dollars into the job and the job was 10% done. The next day he showed up and we ran out to get drywall and supplies and they charge extra for trip charges. The company only scheduled him for 4 hours on my job. So by the time we got the supplies he only had 2.5 hours to work on my job. We (emphasis on we - I was his help for the entire job) got drywall into one spot. No mud or tapping. So now I am into this job $800 and the job is 25%. I am so ******. I called to complain and they claimed that he spent most of the time fixing previous work. Such BS. They wanted to schedule a followup appt to finish the job. I said no thanks and I called a drywall company to fix. The handyman also did not tape anything off so there was dust everywhere. I cleaned up after everything he did because I didn't want to pay him $100/hour to vacuum. And the next day I noticed a couple outlets didnt work. I am not sure what he did. Another thing...I also helped him with the job the entire time. Placing the drywall, screwing it in, holding it up, I went to the store with him and I cut 2x2s for him with my chop saw. The only thing they did good was showed up on time. I would not recommend these guys. Hire a pro not a general handyman if you want the job done right."
2,"Pros: - Work that was finished on siding was done well. Cons: - Job was left unfinished. Workers claimed the remaining part of the wall was ""too dangerous"" to access without a lift, even though nothing about it was pointed out during quoting and even into the first days of the job. When I pointed out the unfinished part of the house, I was informed that the quote was time/materials, and I would receive a separate quote for the work that was supposed to be finished in the first place. Still waiting for that quote. - Soffit color did not match existing soffit. I was informedafter the product was installed that the color I have would have to be special order and would take time to procure. They had 2 months between our agreement and the actual work being done (due to bad weather); more than enough time to find and buy matching soffit."
5,"Mr. Handyman sent Ralph Saverine for our job. He was on time, went out of his way to be responsive to our requests and was both personable and professional. We have used the services of Mr. Handyman in the past and will certainly do so in the future as projects come up."
2,"I had a water damage on my living room drywall and it took almost 4 visits spread across 2 weeks to fix it. The quality of work was poor and they were supposed to complete the work with interior painting too. But till date, after 3 weeks of follow up, the painting work is still not completed. No response to emails...I made the mistake of paying them for the work done till date. Now they have got paid, it looks like they have conveniently decided not to respond and finish up the work"
5,Ralph was professional and did a great job.
5,"Ralph was a pleasure to work with; friendly, prompt, and trusted during the two visits."
1,"I sent a message on their website on Sept 12th. They called me on the 13th and asked if I could send some pictures, which I did. When I did not hear back I called the next day. I was told their tech had yet to look at the pictures but that he should get to it that day. After still not getting a call back that business day, I sent another message from their website. I just wanted to know if they would take the job or if I needed to look elsewhere. The next day, a Friday, and hour before they closed for the weekend, I still hadn't heard from them. I used the ""live chat"" on their website. I got the feeling it wasn't live since the response was generic. The ""guy"" I was chatting with wanted my phone number and email then abruptly ended the chat saying someone would contact me. I did get a call back, but the answer was the same...the tech still has to look at the pictures, which he will do over the weekend. To date, which is Nov 29th, I have yet to hear back. However, they have added me to their emailing advertising list, which is ironic since they never followed up in any way for the job I needed done. By the next Monday when they still had not contacted me I moved on to another company who wanted my business."
4,"They added blackjack around the seam of that - but it did nothing to stop the leaks. When I called back to get next steps - they quickly said ""no thanks"" and suggested I call a roofer. They charged quite a bit for not much service. HOWEVER, that said, they were very professional, cleaned everything up quite nicely - so I cannot complain there - they did what they were asked - but the leak persists."
5,The was performed accurately and efficiently. I would definitely use them again.
5,"The large holes were on about 30ft. high, Ralph was very knowledgeable on how to repair the damage. He did a fantastic job, I can't see where the damage was. We are very happy with the job Ralph did. We would definitely call him for any work we need done."
1,"I strongly discourage using this company. First, the handyman that quoted our job quit and a different handyman came in his place a day early. The new man did a terrible job muffing and taping. He took the entire day to get about half of a standard size living room done. When your paying by the hour that’s a big deal. The next day when he was to come back he never showed and the company could not get a hold of him. After waiting all day I went out to the store only to find that while I was gone he broke into my house to get his tools. The company had nothing to say other than an apology. I never heard from the company again for months until I was sent a letter letting me know they’re putting a lein on my house for a bill I never even saw. So for $870 I had an incomplete job that had to be fixed by JB drywall."
2,"I found other comparable services providers who would do the same services for half the price. The reason I chose to go with Mr. Handyman is because they told me they could do the electrical that the other company told me up front they couldn’t do. Their tech came out, install the microwave fine. Hung the closet doors wrong (before they were getting stuck, after he finished they just fall of the track) and removed switch plates (and didn’t replace them) for the electrical to tell us he couldn’t fix it. For this I got billed for 3.5 hours of work; for tasks that should have taken two hours and the electrical they couldn’t do. I did talk to the company and they were very eager to make it right and their second technician was able to correct what the previous tech did wrong, but came back with same outcome on the electrical. I am fine paying an electrician to fix the lights, but I shouldn’t have been billed for the time they decided they couldn’t do it and, moreover, they should not have told me they could have done the lights if they couldn’t."
5,It was an excellent experience. Dean went above and beyond in fixing the issue and was meticulous in the finishing. He also came up with a solution for some rotting wood at the base of the window/door. He also came up with a solution to the cause/source of the water problem. The end result was a night and day difference. I look forward to working with Dean in the future.
1,"If I could give this company zero stars I would. This is the worst experience that I have ever had with a contractor. I truly cannot even understand how these people are still in business. We called Mr. Handyman to have two windows installed in place of one window. We called this type of service because the existing opening would need to be changed for the two new windows to fit and I could not find a window installation company that framed openings. I was assured that their guys would handle everything. My quote was to be on Aug 1st with work to start on Aug 4th as long as I had the windows. When the confirmation call came for the estimate I was told Aug 4th hadn't been saved for us and we were moved to Aug 10th but if something was canceled they would do the job sooner. A little disappointing but understandable. On Aug 1st their guy came out and did not do an estimate but told my husband that he had until 4:00 to work and would be able to get the two windows done as well as some of the basement windows we also wanted to install. With that information my husband signed for him to start work. However he didn't have all the tools he needed to do the job so he had to borrow them from us. He was also called from the office and told he would have to leave the job by 3:00 to go to another job, but he would have the two windows in by then since we now had a big hole in our home. A little later one of the owners came out and told him he had to leave at 2:30 not caring that we had a big opening in our home. In the end their guy left, leaving a big hole in our home, a window that he ruined by cutting the nailing tabs off and taking our battery and nice drill bit that had a sleeve to hold screws. He said he would be back after 5:00 to finish the job. We had to cancel our plans for the evening. Worse than that, upon further inspection we found that most of the work that had been done was wrong or unnecessary. At $104 per hour one doesn't want to pay for these things. Plus there was about an hour talking either to his office and the owner that I didn't think we should have to pay for. When I called the office I was told they would check into the missing items, but were in no way concerned with my window or the hole in my house. I told them not to have their guy come back except to bring back the tools. He never showed up. The next day I called and was told I was lying and that nothing had been taken from our home. We were still going to be billed and that I needed to take the issue of the window up with the owner. It took 3 days to speak to him and he didn't call me. In the mean time I called the office and told them that if the items were not returned that I would get the police involved. Later that day I got a call that their guy had suddenly realized that he did have our items. She didn't know if it had anything to do with the threat of the police, but he would be returning our items. She apologized and asked if they could send someone else out. I of course said no because not only did their guy not know what he was doing but they also had very bad customer service. I spoke to her about the window, telling her that they can certainly have the window I just need to be reimbursed because I had to purchase another window which I also had to order and wait for another week for it to come in. She was very apologetic and said she would relay the information to the owner. When I finally got a hold of the owner he said that he would not be paying for the window and that his guy did know what he was doing. I told him that just because we chose to hire someone to do the work rather than do it ourselves didn't mean that we didn't know what should and shouldn't be done. At that point he no longer let me speak but instead starting belittling us for hiring someone to do a job we could do ourselves. At this point I swore at him and he hung up. When I called back he hung up again. I then called back and spoke to the other owner. She was no better than the other guy. She threatened to put a lien on our home. DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!! To recap: One window damaged (new one still on order), tools taken, room left a mess, horrible owners. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!"
5,I was signing their praises. We have really had very positive experience with them.
5,"We've had nothing bad happen from them. They always come right away, honestly, I can't say enough good about them. My son moved to Austin and I made sure he knew to check in with Mr. Handyman. They are always on time and if they aren't they always call. They're professional and seem to know what they are doing They have always been able to do what we needed them to come do. We have just always had positive experiences."
5,went according to plan and met our expectations
1,"Worst install I have ever been apart of. Was rough quoted 5 hours for 2 storms and 2 entry, came home to check on the job and the installer made it known he was leaving at 4. At the end of the day, they installed 1 door, I will admit it wasn't an average install, but it was 1 door in 6 hours. The door was so poorly installed, there was gap on the bottom of the door that I could see clearly out to the yard. There was spray foam insulation on the new doors and the house and yard were left a complete mess. Screws in the grass, GREAT for young kids and dogs, shards of wood, cardboard and ""stuff"" left everywhere. I called, and gave ample opportunity for the franchise owner to rectify this and all I got was there nearly $700 bill for a garbage install and another bill to have someone else come back to correct the garbage job Mr. Not so Handyman did the first time. Still no call from the owner. I would not EVER recommend these people to anyone. Not worth the money!"
1,They never showed up for the appointment on 4/3 and I haven't heard from them since.
5,Very well. Needed a part. Once part arrived work was completed. He listened to what I needed. Made a recommendation which saved hundreds of dollars.
2,"Well the customer service was good. Very professional, they called back right away. The contractor showed up on time, and that was it. After he left I have yet to hear back from Mr. Handy. I paid $50 for a quote that I have yet to receive. It has been a week. I was told the quote would take 1 to 2 days. Well they missed out a job and if I do not receive the quote by Saturday. I will be calling to get my money back!"
5,On time worked diligently to complete all jobs.
5,Was on time ran & got supplies needed & installed to the best of his ability.
5,Very well. Dean did what he was suppose to do.
5,Excellent! Dean is very knowledgeable about his work & has a great personality. The work was done timely & all the patch work & painting was a perfect match & blended in beautifully
4,"One of the repairs, replacing some molding on a screen door, didn't last. The ""new"" molding came out a couple of days after the repair."
3,"My wife and I had completed the footing and framing ourselves but needed a hand getting it completed before winter. I uploaded some pictures to Mr. Handyman and the two in the office (one being the owner) said it would probably take a days worth of work with 2 people. They sent out a carpenter who was able to look at the job before we started and said it was at least 2 days of work. I was ultimately ok with this as I know it's hard to see a job with pictures. When the carpenter came out, he was early, which was great because he needed to get all set up and going. I had left. When I returned they had about 48 sq ft of deck completed and all of the starting hooks installed. There was 2 guys with a 3rd working about 2 hours. By the time the day was done, they had about 100 Sq ft of deck installed and instead of taking 2 days, it was now estimated at 7 days. They charge $98 an hour for the carpenter and $63 for the 2nd hand plus about $87 for a trip charge. This project, if I had them finish it, would cost me nearly $10,000! I got another quote from a guy that does Trex decks in the range of $1800. The carpenter for Mr. Handyman did superb work. He was very meticulous and what he did complete looked great. He claimed that the joists were 12"" apart and there was a lot of shimming that needed to be done. That was the reason for the time put in and the length of time it would take. Not sure why this was detected earlier? The second day that was initially scheduled could not be done until 11/07. I cancelled the second day and plan to hire someone else to complete it."
1,They came to give me an estimate and never heard from them again. Horrible experience.
5,They were prompt and did good work. A little on the expensive side at 90/hr not including materials.
2,Called a couple times and phone just rings; no answering machine either. Quite odd.
5,"This is our third time using this handyman company and all three times it has gone well. While they probably aren't the cheapest around, all three times they have been prompt, professional and got the job done well. Mike the technician did have a bear of a time soldering in the new faucet in a really awkward part of the basement ceiling (hence, the main reason I was not about to attempt this), but did a thorough job. He had to order a couple of parts for the Pella screen door and the shower door which we bought at Home Depot looks fantastic now that it is installed in the master bathroom. I would hire them again."
5,Everything all went well. Jason did a great job and was nice to my family! He kept me in the loop as far as when he would be at the house and would always keep me updated. I am very satisfied with everything!
5,Services performed were excellent. Technician was very friendly and knowledgeable and we would have them back for future projects.
5,"This was the easiest process I have booked in a long time they were on time and did not drag the process out,very happy with the job."
5,"This was our first time using Mr.Handyman and it was a great experience. The technician was punctual, professional and efficient. We will be using Mr. Handyman again for any repair projects I need done around my home."
5,"A very nice job, and great to get all of those things done that have been ""hangin"""
5,Excellent. He did the work professionally and on time
2,"Mike was punctual for our appointment July 28. He was pleasant and seemed knowledgeable. We have a number of small unfinished projects we would like to get done, along with a larger project in the kitchen to replace the counters and do some cabinet work as well as a couple of outdoor tasks involving the eavestrough and minor siding repairs. I had been very clear with Mike that the estimate should be broken out by job, for example the exterior projects as one sum, kitchen separate, and smaller odd jobs as its own sum. When i had not received the estimate for the work within a week, I contacted the office and was told Mike had the estimate in his truck and would send it through. Nothing arrived. We had a death in the family so I did not contact the office again until yesterday, only to have them call today and ask about what work I wanted done. I explained that Mike had been here a month ago and I was still waiting for the quote. Later this afternoon I received the quote for $6400, but it was just one sum, not broken out as I requested so I have no idea how much the kitchen work is as compared to the eavestrough etc. and overall the total seemed very high to me. I wrote back and asked for the quote as I requested it a month ago, no response yet. Either way, we are going to use someone else. If getting an accurate quote is this challenging I doubt I have the patience to deal with managing them for an actual job. It's too bad - we could have been good clients as neither of us are handy and we would much rather pay for good work than try to bumble along on our own."
4,"- Work was of good quality. - Coordination between office and contractor was not good. Consequently items were not ordered in timely fashion, and project completion was stretched out. - Originally assigned contractor did not show up for first appointment. Waited for close to an hour. Replacement contractor was punctual and did a good job. - They provide a nice service and I would use them again. Things work better when you communicate directly with the contractor versus going through their central office."
1,"I needed a handyman to make improvement to a few items on a house we were selling. The original employee that came to the house severely underestimate the time that it would take to complete the job. While at the job site, he wasted a lot of time, lied on him time card, and did not show up prepared for the job. He took apart the windows and then left to go get parts. He was gone for 4 hours. when he came back to the house, it started to rain, so he duct taped plastic around the windows and left. He charged us for 10 hours of work at nearly $100 dollars an hour!! I contacted the office with my complaints and gave them written statements about what had taken place. They notified me that I was not the only person to have this type of issue and the employee was let go. they said they would honor the price that was originally quoted, but it took over a month for them to get someone back out to the house. In the mean time, we are trying to show our house for sale with big ugly bags on our windows. Need less to say, we didn't get any offers during that time. Once the second employee came out the finish the work, he was very fast, but at the expense of some sloppy workmanship. I would not recommend Mr. Handyman to anyone I know."
5,"Upon the first visit everything went as expected, the guy came out on time, removed the casing, used a moisture meter to verify where the water was and even provided some tips on how to dry out the casing, treat for potential mold and repaint the casing. I opted to do the painting to save some money. After a few days the office called to schedule the return trip to put everything together which was really nice as it saved me on having to call in for an appointment. On the return trip I did run into a snag where the first appointment of the day was running late so I received a call from the scheduler to let me know he would be an hour late. I waited an extra 30 minutes past the revised arrival time but Mike never showed up. I called back and received the answering service which was not very helpful. Now 2 hours late I called back at which point the answering service said they would get the message to the scheduler but I never received a call back that day. The next day I called and received the scheduler at which point she had Mike out later that day. Overall I was impressed with Mike's knowledge and attention to detail on making sure everything was taken down and put back to look like it never happened. I would be nice if in the future if the service man can't make it out you would get proper notification so you are not waiting around all day. I would use them again for the items around the house which require more skill than I possess or am comfortable doing myself."
1,"Here is my response to each of his points: At that time all gutters were cleaned and all downspouts were working properly : How can you confirm? It was December 15th and there was no rain at the point of time gutters were supposedly clean, Again the technician cleaned the gutter but did not clean the debris at the elbow joints. We have cleaned his gutters before and he always waits to the last minute to get them cleaned: This is classic example of lame excuse. Did you ever mention late when I called you? If you think you cannot serve me in a professional manner rather than sending a lousy technician and do not stand up for your doing later. Signed the work order stating everything was good and to charge his credit card : My wife signed it and she also mentioned me the technician was done in 20 minutes ( and i was charged for 2 hours). As I hired them before , I let it go by with some kind of trust and reliability. I admit I made a mistake and should have notified them about the time. On Dec. 24th we were at (removed member name) house to fix the extension to the gutters to keep the water away from his house, nothing was said that there was a problem. 6 months go by and we get a call stating that we did a sloppy job on his gutters and downspouts. I first noticed a problem when it rained hard this May. Some water overflowed the gutters after a hard rain : Just to keep the fact straight they came to my house on Dec 15th ( I called in November). I saw the problem late April and thoughts my gutters are not working properly. I request quote from 3 different gutter company.They said my gutters are fine but the joints are clogged as it was not cleaned properly before winter. 6 months go by and we get a call stating that we did a sloppy job on his gutters and downspouts : Do not exaggerate; you better know dec to april are freezing months , during warm up the freezing water can seep by the clogged elbows. The problem starts when you start to have April showers. And at that time I have noticed the problem and start to find the reason. Clogged elbow will not cause of Ice daming. I would like to make everyone happy when we do work for our customers, customer service is important to us as we are a customer service company. We do have a warranty on our work if the craftsmanship is not up to your standards or a part fails during the first year: This is the first time I have complained your cleaning. You have cleaned my gutter previous three years ( annually) at the same time (just before winter)and no problem happened . This time you did a lousy job, hence the problem occurred and I have complained . Actually I have called 3 times , every time the problem was supposedly noted by your receptionist; after the third time she said me to sent an e-mail(wasted my time). After getting no response of the e-mail, when I called back , she chatted 2 minutes with someone and said "" gutter cleaning does not have a warranty"". You took 10 days to response(""saying you will do nothng"" )starting from my first day of complaint. Is this a sign of a ""customer service company""?"
5,"It went great, Menard was very professional and did a great job. I still have a few other jobs we discussed that I will have him back to complete."
5,"This is a very old house. Consequently all the pipes & routes to them were in small, hard to get at places. The bathtub is upstairs but the clog extended to the downstairs. Mike knew everything we needed to get the job done and it took minimal replacement parts ( some new PVC ). This man was awesome! He worked hard, getting covered in black crap & he even cleaned up the mess after he was done. He explained it all as he went. We felt his price was more than fair. We could have kicked each other later because we needed him more than a few times after but could not find his contact info. to save our lives. I don't think A.L. had him posted for me to review. We couldn't even remember his name for sure - & no we were not under the influence. We do think it was 'Mike' tho'. So Mike, if you are reading this, please get more advertizing out for yourself. I'm sure that others will be impressed with your work."
5,Created the arms to replace what original installer had and correct problem with amazing quality at a fraction of the cost of replacing the window.
5,Jim arrived on time and explained in detail what was going to be performed. Very polite. Work area cleaned. Look forward to having Jim return for future work.
5,"From start to finish, a job well done!"
5,"Chad and Mike picked up the new door at Home Depot, and installed it. They had to remove the outer storm door to do this, which took about as much time to put back in as it did to install the new entry door. They did a good job and even moved some hardware from the old door frame to the new door frame that I requested. Very courteous, explained what was going on, and did the job as asked."
5,"We were on a very tight timeline to get the work done prior to closing on the sale of a house. When I called them, Debbie answered the phone and knew exactly what I was talking about and made a very close estimate on how long all of the work would take. My only complaint, and it's not specific to this job, is that I hate paying for service by the hour. I always wonder if the provider is working to the best time equation or if the work is being drug out to get another 30 minutes of pay. I don't have evidence that this happened this time, but I just wonder. I was also concerned about a $10 charge for a few pieces of tape used on the dryer vent. I'm not sure that was a just price. In the end, the work was done and done well. I can't complain about anything in regards to the quality of the work. And the responsiveness of the office staff was superb-from the first call to the electronic copy of the paid receipt and lien reciept we needed to provide the lender."
2,They came out to give an estimate for interior painting in multiple rooms but they never got back with me.
3,They were very expensive compared to other handyman services; that is why I stopped using them. I had a big issue with their professionalism. I would probably not use them in the future.
5,"It went extremely well. They were responsive. They came when they said they were going to come; right down to the second. They performed the work that was requested and they kept true to their cost estimates. The repairs have lasted for two years; just long enough which was what I needed, long enough so I could afford to replace the pergola. So I am extremely happy because I was concerned the repairs were not going to be structurally sufficient to last as long as they have and they have. They are not cheap but you get extremely good quality work. I didn’t think anybody could make that pergola last at all but they did."
5,The overall quality of the work was good. The gentleman was pleasurable. He was a nice guy. He put it in and he was talkative. Everything was fine. He did a good job. I would recommend them. He did the job and he knew what he was doing. He did it professionally and has done it very well.
5,He did an absolutely beautiful job. I really feel that the price was fair. It has held up beautifully. I have no complaints. They cleaned up beautifully.
4,"They did a good job. Theirs was the lowest bid out of the three or four people that I checked out. They had to take shutters down, paint them and put them back."
1,"We live in a mobile home, there was only a small piece of siding that got affected, they were more interested in the fence that was across the way that is owned by the owner of the mobile court. They were more interested in fixing the fence which is owned by the mobile court owner. It was probably a $250 job probably to fix it which we still don't have fixed. He didn't even write up an estimate or anything. We asked multiple people to please write up an estimate and nobody was willing to do it. My sister in the last year to do a job and she was more than happy with him but to do this little, tiny job, they were not willing to do. If you have this huge job that's worth thousands of dollars, yes, the kind that you probably have to take a bank loan out, yes. But if you have this menial task that's probably beneath them, no. They didn't even gave us an estimate, they didn't want to do it."
4,"He showed up and he was very professional. He came on time, analyzed the problem and said it will take X number of hours to do the work and he was spot on. He was very friendly and told me how he began as a handyman. It was something he wanted to do for sometime and he is good at it."
4,"It was fine. I didn't have a problem with the storm door that they fixed. It was okay. It got the job done but it wasn't really pretty. It was an old storm door. The screws had pulled out of the wood and had been repaired several times, it just wasn't working, so he was able to fabricate a metal plate to put in there and attach that, screw that in and then attach the door closer to that, so it's working, it's just not real pretty."
1,Sent an email to get a quote. Got bac to send them my phone. Sent it. After 7 days no return. After all bad reviews I am not going with them.
5,"Installation went without a hitch. Friendly, expeditious, professional service. I had been concerned about this installation because Home Depot installers claimed I ordered the wrong size door for the space and seemed to want to create barriers to getting the job done (like scheduling me weeks out). I had faith in the manufacturer (ironically a supplier of Home Depot) and in my measurements. And I really had the feeling Home Depot didn't want to do it. Mr. Handyman just came out and did the work. Fit was perfect, door looks and functions great."
2,"The work to be done at my mother's home was ""estimated"" at approximately $750/7 hours of labor which broke down to $90+ dollars per hour plus materials. The worker showed up at 8:30 a.m. as promised and finished part of the work by approximately 8:30 p.m. This did include trip to the store for some unexpected but needed parts and a side trip to another job site. He had not yet completed the faucet replacement. He was to return at 8:30 a.m. the next morning. He called me at 7:20 a.m. the next morning and said he was on his way to my mother's home but did not have the tool needed to bore holes in the tub for the new faucet. He did, however, leave the bill and despite my asking him to do so, made no contact with my mother. I attempted to reach him at 11 a.m. wondering when he would be returning to my mother's home, as she had already had to cancel a medical appointment to accommodate the second day of work. I was told he would be there after 3 p.m. By 3:30 p.m. my mother rescheduled for another day. I found it funny that I had received a customer satisfaction survey prior to the work being completed. I did contact Mr Handyman to ensure that the bill would not be paid until the work was complete. They were agreeable to that arrangement. On the new date the worker showed up on time and finished the faucet installation. He did require my mother to sign another work order/bill for the faucet work prior to the job being started. The worker failed to clean up his mess where the new floor under the water heater was installed. He also did a poor job of reinstalling the paneling and trim that covered the access to the tub water supply. I will say that the trim was not in the greatest shape to start, but there was a complete length, albeit in segments, that held the paneling in place. After his work, there are simply small, non continuous segments of trim holding the paneling in place. Her final bill was $1,165.10 and according to the worker she was not charged for his shopping time and only charged half the labor time for the faucet installation. I did read at least one review on Angie's list that Mr Handyman did not honor their estimate, but I opted to go with them anyway. Most of the work was done well, but I would not hire Mr Handyman again due to the significant difference in the estimated number of hours to complete the job vs. the actual time to complete the work resulting in an increase of over $300 in her final bill."
1,"I called to check availability and rates for a handyman to install some doors and light fixtures. The secretary took my name and number and stated that scheduling would get back to me with availability. No one ever called back. Three days after my initial call, I called back explaining that this was my second call. The secretary took my info again and list of projects to be completed. She stated I would receive an email with an estimate. I never received an email, estimate or return call. . Also they charge $96/hour along with a one time fee of $58 for travel I guess. This is expensive compared to others I have researched."
5,"I had a very good experience. They were very prompt, courteous and very nice."
5,Great - no complaints. They returned my calls and emails most importantly.... they showed up on time- they completed the work in 1 day - cleaned up afterward--Would absulutely use them again.
5,I use the same person over and over again which they are allowed to do. You can have whoever is available when you want or you can have the same person over and over. It is very easy to schedule stuff. If you need them on a specific day they are pretty good at getting me in. I paid them on hourly basis and the things I have done was for three hours and they will go on drive if they don’t have them on truck and it has happened to us once.
5,"Chad is really, really good at what he does when it comes to repairs and upgrades. There was a bunch of stuff that needed fixing at my duplex and Chad was fantastic. The best part of the service is Chad had a idea for a door closer on the door from the attached garage to the back hall that was brilliant. I had bought one of those auto closers you see on screen doors but Chad was afraid a taller person would get poked in the eye by it in the cramped quarters of the small garage. He came up with a much better solution. Using his expert carpenter skills he modified the door hinge area of the wood door and installed spring loaded door hinges. I have never seen them before but do they work great! Now when one of my tenants leaves doesn't remember to closet he door behind them, the door automatically shuts itself now. Much safer for everyone in the building and way more energy efficient in the cold winter months. Chad is the best!"
1,"On March 27, 2014 I had an appt with Joe for 8:30 am. By 9:15 I called the office, Debbie answered, she didn't apologized for the delay, just said the office was hectic and she was sending Marty, the owner, and he will be there by 10. Marty showed up closer to 10:30, saying it was a hectic morning. We went over what I wanted done, and he said he will get back to me with an estimate. April 7, I called since I had yet to received an estimate, Marty answered the phone saying, he had some family issues and will get on it. I said not a problem. April 21, I called again to inquire about my estimate, Debbie answered and said that Marty had some family issues, I said not a problem but I would like to get the estimate, she assured me she will let Marty know. April 29, I called again to inquire about the estimate, Debbie answered and said she will let Marty know and that I will receive a call the next day (april 30) either from her or Marty. April 30 - no calls from either May 1, today, I called, Marty answered, I asked if he remembered me he said yes, I asked for my estimate and also said I feel as if he didn't want my business. He got very loud and said he was working on it with all these other companies...then puts me on speaker phone. I asked him what is up with the attitude? I have been very polite thru out. I said all I want is an estimate and it has been a month, and I thought they were nice when they came out last summer to give us an estimate (at that time I really didn't know what I wanted, this time I did), as I was trying to tell him that I thought they were nice, he hung up on me. I am not sure why there was such a delay with my estimate, all the other estimates was in within 7 days. In fact the estimate from his company last summer was submitted within 7 days after meeting. I have been polite and courteous thru out this past month, when I said I feel as if he didn't want my business, I said it in jest, I absolutely didn't not expect such over the top reaction from him. Why come out if they didn't want my business? Or why not tell me after the second phone call? Marty Putz is totally unprofessional and I will not recommend this business to anyone. I do not care whatever type of awards Marty has received, his dealing with me has been unprofessional and a disgrace to those in his industry."
5,Excellent service. They came in and diagnosed it for a reasonable price.
5,They did an excellent job but they were an hour late and didn't call to tell me they were going to be late. They are also very expensive.
5,"Well now I have met all the great people at Mr. Handyman and Chris was fantastic too. So for your projects big and small I can definitely recommend this great provider. The project was more complicated than it sounds because Chris had to drill through existing tile to install the new towel bars. No tiles were chipped or nicked which was great because I didn’t have any spare tiles. Chris is an expert at what he does. Some of the towel rods were too long and he had to cut them to fit but everything turned out better than perfect. These are great people to work with as their office is easy to schedule with and the field guys are very, very dependable."
4,Good service and very professional. The costs for the services were very expense.
5,"Fast, friendly and professional describes the work done by Jerry of Mr. Handyman. When I called in to schedule the person in the office was fantastic and I knew exactly what time and day to expect Jerry. Who is a peach and was very thoughtful too and completely did the work and cleaned up so everything is as good as new. This sounds like two simple things but it was not. The first installation of the large, multi-tier towel bar was not done correctly by another vendor and when it fell off the wall it left two gaping holes. Jerry installed it securely and perfectly patched over the holes. Great job!!! I would recommend this company to anyone you has those lists of things that need to be done well as their home too."
4,"They did a fine job cleaning the gutters, but when I tried to get them back for some repeat business, they never responded. I asked him about several other things while he was here and he seemed interested, but I have given up and hired others to take care of those jobs."
3,The gentleman came out...he was very nice... made a list of the things we wanted done...provided a quote....then never showed up or called us.
5,"They were outstanding. Treated my home as if it were their own. Protected stairs, walls and furniture as they were removing items."
5,"Work was done very professionally. Technician was very courteous and polite. I asked him to observe other necessary repairs - he noted nothing other than what I had already observed and did not appear to try ""selling"" me on any unnecessary services. My only complaint was that I requested a quote for a few follow-up projects but never received that quote. Nevertheless, given the quality of the work - I will use this provider again."
5,Matched and installed a deadbolt for an exterior door. I was slightly disappointed that the deadbolt was something i could have purchased at the local DIY store but it works fine and the installation was professionally done.
5,"I've used them several times, and they work with you, they are always there when I need them and they do very good work. And if they don't do good work, they'll come back and they'll fix it, no questions asked.I've got to also buy my own materials. All the other places, they bring the material and they have a mark-up on it. There's no other place that I know of, I just had some work done by Monty and I think there were parts that had to be replaced or rebuilt and they set it up for me but I paid for it, and it saved me pretty close to 50% if not more. Because I needed some sections of the kickpanels of the door, they were scuffed up and I wanted it painted and you have to have a plastic paint for that. They called NAPA and they gave my name, told me to give them a call, said I'll pay for it, etc. They told me it would cost me $140 some odd dollars for the paint, for two cans. And I paid NAPA $25. That's the mark-up. Just for the sake of we need this part to fix it. So that's what Mr. Handyman allows me to do, I will supply the materials and you supply the labour, you know what I mean? So I am very happy with them, very happy. As a matter of fact I had a little bit of plumbing work done with them, they came in gave me an estimate. And I said ""You tell me exactly what you need, I will go and get it for you"", and they couldn't find a corresponding number for it, they said we'll go down, we'll get it for you and we won't give you the mark-up. We'll give you the receipt for it - which was nice of them. It's a franchise, but the one here, I like. The other ones, I don't know. The one I dealt with, I am extremely happy. You call them, they talk to you, they'll take all the time that you need on the phone, in front of you, whatever. I like the workmanship that they do, and if they screw up at all they come back and they fix it. They put in a basement window for me. I had other people come in, where I was going to buy it from them. They came in and were going to charge me a minimum charge of $450, and of course you get all the excuses like ""Oh we have to pay them for minimum four hours work"" etc. etc. These guys? They came in and they did it in an hour and they charged me an hour of labour and I supplied the parts."
3,"I went with this company due to what I seemed to be a fair price based on the estimate given by the installer. The actual installer and customer service representative on the phone were very easy to work with and pleasent. We missed the original install date but rescheduling was not a major issue. The installation went smoothly and the installer was very careful not to make a mess. I did experience a leak in the faucet line, which I discovered the next morning but was able to get someone out the next day to fix the leak. My concern with this project comes with the final price as compared to the original estimate. When I received the original estimate of $350, the installer said it would be a $300 project. He put a $50 cushion on the estimate in case he ran into any issues. I was not advised of any major issues with the installation or other that would have increased my bill from the original estimate. In the end, the final bill was $599 or almost double the original estimate. Per the installer, since there was such a large discrepancy, I contacted the company to discuss the final bill in light of the scheduling issues and eventual leak I had experienced. I was very flexible to work with their schedule. After the missed original installation date, I took a day off of work to meet their schedule. I received a response from the owner that I consider rude and in my opinion, unprofessional. I was accused of ""using Angie's list as a pawn to get money off for a (possitive) review,"" which in no way was my intent. I take great responsibility in writing these reviews as I rely on other customer reviews to help make my service provider decisions. I was offered a $50 off coupon and was told I would either be taken out of their system or 'highlighted in red' for future services. I asked they remove me from their ""system."" Final opinion, I am satisfied with the work performed but dissatisfied with the discrepancy between the original estimate and final bill. I should have been advised during the installation if the final bill was not going to be consistent with the estimate. Customer service was mixed."
5,"If you need a professional company to help you with repairs this is the company you should call. I cannot thank them enough for helping me out with an emergency repair I needed today due to damaged caused by one of my tenants. Mr. Handyman went out of their way to come all the way to Shorewood and fix the doors that were broken and caused a security problem. This is a fantastic provider and I know you will be happy with the service they provide to you too. This business is owend by Marty and he and his wonderful office staff found a way to help me on such short notice which I appreciated and Chad, their technician, did a fantastic job"
5,"We found them on Angie's List. They were very professional. They responded quickly and they also followed up with quotes fast as well. Overall, they were very nice people. One thing they did was instead of doing everything, they even gave us options so that we could fix it ourselves if we didn’t want to pay them to help save us money as well, so they were very accommodating. I would definitely call them again if we need to do stuff around the house."
4,"The first guy did not do a good job. However, they sent another guy to fix and complete the work."
4,The service was okay. I felt the price was a little expensive.
3,His service is fine but the cost is way too high for the work done.
5,It went well. They're always easy to reach and they can get things scheduled and done quickly. They can also buy and pickup all materials so I wasn't having to do any running around myself.
4,"Because they charged me a $50 trip charge and never disclosed that this would be part of the costs, I feel like they deceived me. I would not hire them to come back because of this."
5,"Super friendly and professional on the phone and in person. Did the jobs quickly (did not milk the hourly rate). Keep in mind that if they have to get parts or supplies that you don't provide or tell them that they'll need to bring (they do inform you of this when you set up your appointment) that the time to go get things is billable. When I have another list of stuff to get done, I will definitely call them again!"
4,"The work was done quickly and well; the only issue was the complexity due to the number of switches turning on a light. The handyman needed additional help and added some time to the project. It turned out good, but was more difficult to estimate total cost."
5,"He was within budget, on time, and very professional. The job turned out great. He was reasonably priced. I would use them again in the future."
5,"Gave accurate time estimate, arrive on time every time, help prevent future problems."
4,"Overall it went OK and the end product was fine. The workman, however, broke the vanity basin that he was installing by applying too much torque before the basin was properly set. The basin broke and flying porcelain hit the workman in the head, causing significant bleeding. Stuff happens, and the workman was apologetic (and the cut wasn't as bad as it appeared). He also indicated that he had several other mishaps in the course of his handyman work (fell in a hole while carrying a big door, acorn junk in his eye while cleaning a gutter, etc.). In any event, they readily replaced the basin within a couple of days and came and fixed and finalized everything to our satisfaction."
4,Very friendly and punctual. Worked quickly and efficiently. Very reasonably priced.
2,"I thought the trip charge was a little high. He came to do a standard plumbing job which he knew in advance. You would think he had standard plumbing supplies in his truck, but no he left again to pick up parts at a store which is 4 miles down the road and returned 1 hour later charging me 88 dollars for the trip. while doing the job he spilled glue on the floor which stained it and never came off. I would never recommend them to any one in the future."
3,"We hired Mr. Handyman to install doors in December of last year. Quality and price were good, however punctuality was not. We were the first job of the morning, and he was an hour late. The poor grades are a result of them never following up on a larger job we had called on. After a positive experience with the doors, we called for an estimate to remodel a bathroom and convert a room into a 1st floor laundry. We never received a call back, called a 2nd time, and were told they forgot. We do not recommend them since there was zero follow through."
3,"Initially we were satisfied with the work. We ran into the problems with the most recent work. They sand blasted the fireplace hearth without a hepa-filter. That left fine dust all over the house. My husband is on oxygen and the dust caused serious breathing problems. I have contacted the owner Marty and have spoken to him multiple times. He is unwilling to take responsibility and said that I should have told the worker to stop once I saw the dust. He hung up on me and refuses to talk to me further. I had to hire another company to clean the dust and that cost me $500. All Marty offered was $300 of free service from them, but I never want them in my home again."
5,"Mark came to do the estimate and he was also the one who did the job. His performance was above and beyond the call of duty as he had to work in full sun on one of the hottest days of the summer. He was on time and he completed the job in the time he thought it would take. He was extremely professional. I also spoke with Debbie in the office numerous times and she, too, was great to work with. She was on vacation when I thought we'd have the bill so I called the office and Marty, the owner, took the call. It was a pleasure to deal with him also. I can only give Mr. Handman high praise! Thanks to Angie's List for helping me to find them. We will certainly call them again when we have jobs like that to be done. Our original handyman retired so we were at a loss for a time but Mr. Handyman appeared at the right time. Thank you to Marty, Debbie and especially Mark who worked so hard in the heat!"
5,"Chris arrived about 5 minutes early and I had two lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling in the garage and wanted them replaced with ceiling fans. Chris put the ceiling fans together and installed them, he even programmed the remote control so that both ceiling fans run from the same remote. He was kind enough to look at my garage door opener that was giving me some trouble. He even shared with me a product that he uses to repair cracks in drywall. He was very nice, and took the time to look and fix a couple of smaller items. He took about 2 1/2 hours to complete the job, and cleaned up everything completely. I have called the company to have additional work completed."
5,The workman was competent and pleasant. The work was performed very promptly. The job was reasonably priced.
2,"When they came over to do the work I needed they didn’t give me the discount the flyer promised, and they charged a travel charge as well!"
5,"He completed his job in a couple days with the two areas we had agreed upon. He was up front and honest with everything and the price was what it should be, with no added charges. When he came over he noticed that our screen door gets stuck in the ""open"" position, which had been a problem since we moved in, but wasn't as high of an item on our to do list. He had an extra part for the door and fixed that in a couple minutes no extra charge. Very helpful answering questions. I would contact this company in the future and recommend their services to anyone looking for quality work done."
5,"We are in the middle of renovating our kitchen on a shoestring budget and the dated and leaking kitchen faucet had to go. The plumbing configuration under our kitchen sink is unusual, due to the ginormous garbage disposal unit that the previous owners have installed. It takes up one half of the double cabinet with the sound muffling foam thing on it. It's a beast. So after giving it a look, we knew it was time to call in someone with way more experience and the proper tools to do it right. Chris showed up right on the dot and got to work. He had to make a quick run to the hardware store since we bought the wrong supply lines. It took about an hour and 20 minutes and I am sure a lot of contortion to get it done, but he did it! He then gave me some advice on how to prep the chrome finish existing air gap cover to paint it to make it match the oil rubbed bronze finish on the faucet because the bronze finished ones are oddly expensive for some reason. Everything was left neat and tidy and it works so nice and nothing leaks anymore! We felt that while we could possibly have paid slightly less for another service, there was no vague appointment window, they are employees of the company with background checks and good ratings on Angie's List and that it was well worth the ""splurge"" and we are happy."
5,They were very good. I would rate them highly and would use them again in the future if needed.
5,"Called Mr. Handyman on 6/20/11 to have gutters cleaned. Even though we've had a lot of rain lately and thought it would be awhile before they could come out, Brad was there on 6/22/11 at 8:00 am as promised. It took him about an 1 1/2 hrs. to complete the job. Our gutters are absolutely immaculate now. The cost was a little pricey at $86.00/hr. However, due to my husband having recent surgery, we had no choice but to hire someone to do the job. The $25.00 coupon from Angie's List helped and most of all Brad did an excellent job!!"
5,"He did a great job! He worked quickly and completed the project in a timely manor. Overall, I was satisfied with his service."
5,"Overall, the experience went well. We’ve used them three times now, and they’re phenomonal. They've been very punctual, courteous, professional and performed the work in a timely manner on all three visits. They have an hourly rate, which is reasonable. They also provide Angie's List discounts. The owner of My Handyman had subcontracted out another company when we had the gutter guards installed, but the owner was there throughout the process. I'm satisfied with their services and I would highly recommend them."
5,"These guys are exceptional. They immediately discovered that the builder had never included supports, so they added the supports, replaced the rough cedar posts - on time, at budget, you cannot see that the posts were replaced. A pleasure to work with - and will do so again when needed next time."
1,"We met Marty on April 13, 2010. We went over everything we needed done. Porch railings on bottom, some window sills covered in aluminum, garage door trim and rubber seal replaced.We told him we would like it done by end of April. He said ok. We waited for some time, we called him, he called us, eventually he said after a couple of weeks, that he couldn't find railings that long and will see if he can order them. By the end of April, or so later, after coming to the house a total or 2 or 3 times to meet, measure job, he said he ordered the porch railings. We had originally set up 2 or 3 tentative times to do the job. As of today, he called and said on this Monday, he will come tomorrow, Tuesday to do the job. I said ok. Then a few hours later on Monday, he left a message and said he can't do the job and to get somebody else. He said something feels ""wrong"" and he doesn't feel he can do a good job for us! This is almost 6 weeks later after first meeting him!! I tried to call him and l left a message stating that that was horrible what he did to us and unprofessional and told him of course I will make a report on Angies List."
5,The service call went well; he was on time and very nice. Explained what he did and explained the programming of the garage door keypad. Also unstuck a ceiling fan chain.
5,"He did a fabulous job. He was here the next day after I called, in the morning with all the supplies. He was polite and very good. He was very prompt in responding to my call and finished the work on time. The price was also reasonable. He told me what he wanted to do and asked me if I wanted him to do anything else. He is very neat and tidy. He cleaned up after himself. I have recommended him to a friend of mine."
3,"They did what they came over here to do, but I remember that we were not that pleased with the work. They were responsive, but we just were not very happy."
5,"He installed 2 deadbolts, changed the locks on 3 doors and gave me keys for them. He also went to the hardware store and got me a door knob with a lock in it and he did a nice job and I was satisfied with him. He was accommodating and waited for me because I was late."
5,He did a really good job. He cleaned up everything when he was completed and was very prompt.
5,"He was very polite and did a great job of explaining what he would do and how it would be done. They gave me a 25 dollar discount for being an Angie's List member. He did a great job, overall!"
5,"He was very prompt, knowledgeable of how to work with difficulties and was tidy. He performed a high quality of service."
5,I would use him again in the future.
5,We have no complaints about him at all. He was very personal and very polite. He kept me informed about the job how explained everything. We were very satisfied.
5,They are really good. They are prompt and on time. They got the job done in one day. They are professional and I have used them before. Their prices are very fair.
4,"The first employee was very courteous and did an excellent job with the patching, texturizing and painting. Unfortunately, the caulking wasn't quite up to par. After talking to Amy at My Handyman, we made another appointment for someone else to come out to re-caulk. Another employee from My Handyman (Chip) came out about a week later and re-did the caulk at no charge. Chip did a good job, is a pleasant person and thoroughly cleaned up the area afterwards."
5,"They were efficient, knowledgeable. They had the right tools to get the job done quickly and properly."
5,"We always get Chip as our handyman. He is a perfectionist so everything is done great. A screw was bent so our bi-fold door wouldn't close. He repaired that first. When putting the oak casing around the outside edges of the doors and drawers of our outdated bathroom vanity, he mitered the corners, matched up the decorative design of the wood perfectly at the corners, took extra time to sand down the outside edges so the edges were perfectly flat, used wood filler where needed at the mitered corners. When cutting the plastic trellis material for me, he was very patient so he would get all the different sizes I wanted."
4,"I was painting the trim on my home when I found an area on the garage where the wood was rotted. I placed calls to several handymen services. My Handyman returned my call promptly. They quoted me a flat half-hourly fee & scheduled a specific date/time for the service. They also stated that if I had other jobs that I thought of that needed doing, the handyman they sent ""was mine for the day"" & I could add these jobs on. The man they sent was nice, professional, & capable of handling the job repairing the garage. I had, however, remembered that my bathtub faucet was leaking & asked him if he could fix that. He said he would look at it. As he looked at it, it became clear to me that plumbing was not one of his skills. I later found that he was somewhat new to the company & still learning. As the plumbing job was not something I originally asked for, I was OK with this. I was disappointed though, that I was charged for the time he spent looking at & determining he couldn't fix the problem."
5,I haven't had anymore problems. He was courteous and a nice guy.
4,"Job 1: The tech was professional & eager. The office called the nite before the service to verify the details & to ask if there was anything to add. We did add to & it was added to the work order & finished. Job 2: Amy at the office was very responsive to my request for an appt., since the days I was available to have this work done was very limited. She called me bk after an opening which was right for me. They arrived on time. The shower in the basement had a plugged part which would ve to be replace. Brian left to buy a replacement but discovered it would ve to be ordered. He suggested 2 options: ordering the piece & coming back abt. a wk. later, or buy a whole new valve (cost app. the same amount) & replace that day. I decided to have him resemble the shower & leave it w/out doing either, since it is not the main b/room. Brian was careful to subtract time that took him to drive & get a replacement washer for outside faucet. Work took 4 1/2 hrs at $76 per hr, which added up fast."
5,I was very happy with the quality of workmanship that was performed and promptness of arrival! He was very willing and able to take care of the miscellaneous tasks that needed attention. I will use them again.
3,"Randy was late the first day, seemed courteous enough but ill prepared to perform task. Second day was on time, was courteous, but again ill prepared for tasks and made numerous trips to his truck for tools he should have taken with him the first trip. Work completed was done well but feel the cost was out of line with the amount of work."
5,"On time, polite, communicated clearly, explained his work plan completely, gave us options when able. Had trouble reaching company after hours - we are only home in the evenings, we had to leave 3 messages before the company actually called back - this may have been an answering service issue."
5,They were very responsive at returning our call and coming out to do the work. They came back free of charge to make some adjustments to a lock that was installed. We were very satisfied with the work.
5,THEY REALLY WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO ACCOMMODATE MY NEED FOR A FAST APPOINTMENT. I WAS RELOCATING AND HAD TO GET THE WORK FINISHED IN ORDER TO LIST MY HOUSE FOR SALE. I CALLED LATE IN THE AFTERNOON AND THE HANDYMAN WAS THERE THE NEXT DAY. THE WORK WAS EXCELLENT.
5,WHAT I LIKED ABOUT HOW HE WORKED IS THAT HE WOULD MAKE CERTAIN TO HAVE ACCURACY IN PLACING THE ITEMS WHERE I WANTED THEM PLACED. WHEN HE WAS DONE HE ASKED IF I NEEDED ANYTHING ELSE DONE AND HE DID SOME ADDITIONAL CHORES FOR ME. I WAS TOLD WHAT THEIR RATES WERE BEFORE THEY STARTED AND I THOUGHT IT WAS EXPENSIVE AND I WAS GLAD TO HAVE IT DONE.
5,"MY HANDYMAN (CHIP) IS A PERFECTIONIST. WHEN I SCHEDULE HIM FOR WORK, I KNOW THE FINISHED REPAIR WORK WILL LOOK NEW. THE OWNER SOMETIMES STOPS BY TO SEE HOW THINGS ARE GOING. THE COMPANY IS VERY FOCUSED TOWARDS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION."
5,"Polite, courteous, on time, very helpful, and knowledgeable. Excellent!!"
5,"They are not real cheap and I have used them about three times now. They really know how to problem solve and all the people I have worked with have been very knowledgeable. They have a service call charge, a trip charge, cost per hour and cost of materials. If you want the quality sometimes you have to pay the price. I would hire them again. They do not make excuses and I have never had to have them come back to fix something."
5,THE HANDY MAN WAS ON-TIME AND DID AN EXCELLENT JOB REPAIRING THE DAMAGE. HE LEFT JOB SITE NEAT AND TOOK PRIDE IN HIS WORK.
3,"I TOLD HIM THAT MY SPECIFICATIONS MUST BE TO VA STANDARDS, HE SAID THAT HE GOES BY THE STATE STANDARDS. I FELT LIKE I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO ARGUE THIS POINT, I JUST WANTED AN ESTIMATE BASED ON MY SPECIFICATIONS. HE DIDN'T ITEMIZE OR GIVE ME A DRAWING OF THE ITEMS THE WAY THAT I NEEDED. HIS PRICING I FELT WAS VERY HIGH."
5,Everything went great
4,Good nice man
1,wont return my texts or calls.
1,He said he couldn’t do it.
1,They do not service 53095 area
3,The job was too big for them
5,Very nice man and I trust him.
5,It went really well!!
5,It went well.
5,"Timely, professional work."
5,"Great, prompt and efficient"
5,"VERY PROMPT IN RESPONDING; HOWEVER, THEIR PRICES WERE NEARLY DOUBLE OF THE HANDYMAN I USED."
5,"Joe did great work. Timely, neat, and pleasant. It was so great to have him around to get to the things I haven't been able to do myself. I provided all the materials, and Joe was able to install everything and make his own adjustments if necessary. Very knowledgeable and definitely worth every penny. I have already hired them on for additional work and I recommend them highly."
5,"THIS COMPANY WAS VERY PROMPT IN RESPONDING AND INSTALLING OUR NEW STORM DOORS. THE INSTALLER WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND DID AN EXEMPLARY JOB. WE WOULD HIRE THEM AGAIN, AND NO DOUBT WE WILL."
5,CHIP WAS MARVELOUS. HE WAS EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL AND I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE CARE HE TOOK KEEPING EVERYTHING CLEAN.
5,Great job by Ralph.
5,Work performed as expected.
4,I was satisfied with the service.
5,Everything went great.
5,I think they did an excellent job.
1,Very disappointed
5,It all went well.
1,Very dissatisfied.
5,It went great.
5,"Lend A Hand was excellent to work with. The team was prompt, responsive, and great communicators."
3,"Paint, move electrical outlets"
5,Excellent service! Would recommend and use again.
5,I was satisfied with their work
5,"Did a great job, timely and professional. Excellent work and design would recommend them to anyone wanting to do any type of deck work,"
5,"It went as planned and on schedule. Had two good carpenters finish an incompleted part of our house, turning it into a very nice workshop."
1,"Mr. Woodcox did estimate on August 18,2020 my property mgr. He didn’t want to deal with her; only home owner. Spoke with him on the phone said she was my sister and property mgr. and that she knew what I wanted done. I received the estimate the next day. He added painting my kitchen cabinets, I told him that they were not being done and I wasn’t paying $2,995. He made the adjustment and I paid the first installment of $3,337.66 On August 24th I met him at my property. He was showing 2 employees what was suppose to be done. Stayed the bathroom downstairs wasn’t included and claim the concrete by the steps wasn’t suppose to be done. Then he was upset because we had done the cabinets ourselves and wanted to know who and how we did it finally we moved on through the house. Got to Master-bathroom and told his employee that the shower was to be regrouped. I said no, it doesn’t need it that it needed clean. He got argumentive about the grout. I said the garage down stairs was the one. I did price that job. My property manager chimed in and said I told you what they wanted. So the bathroom that he said he would have to pull the tub and toilet and cabinet out; now only need 2 floor tile remove and repair the floor and cut the drywall out at the tub and replaced tile. So he introduce his employees and said one was doing the deck and flooring and one did the painting. And another one would do the flashing on the garage and he was going to rewrite contract. He asked how I like pressure washing job. Told him that under the deck was not cleaned nor the house that was under the deck. Had it done again. Sparkling and repairing started Monday - Friday 8-24,25,26,27,28-2020. On the 28th the 2 employees asked if they could work late to have the weekend off, sure I said. My property mgr stayed until 12:30 a.m. and they were still at it after she left. On Saturday morning came into the house being painted, well we though 99.9% of the walls had damage and runs as well as a bleed through. Several pictures later and reminding Mr. Woodcox that I stated I wanted Behr paint because it has a primer built into it. That I didn’t want Sherrington Williams. He said the house looks good, I told him not for $5,995.00 and not for 1 coat of paint. I said you and I had this discussing on the 25th when you came back out. Stated he thought that the trial patch looked good for one coat and didn’t think the bleed through was okay. One employee was painting the kitchen ceiling with no drop clothes and paint on my hardwood floor. No lights on during painting. So on Augst 31st no shows no calls nothing. Called the owner said one man the painter had a Doctor appointment and they would be out before the afternoon. At 1500 hour called again. I got a text saying busy back tomorrow. September 1, 2020, no show until after 11:00 a.m. called the owner and I ways upset. Jeff the owner said now wait a minute the one guy had flu like system and was being tested for COVID 19. Of course I’m. Rey upset. Said will know in 3 days, here we are 6 days later nothing. On the 2nd I was out picking up supplies. He called said we would be back in 90 minutes or longer, we’ll call me. Now my bathroom in the downstairs the door was shut and stuff piled in front of it so people would know not to go in, Got back door was open I went off on 2 employees that claim they didn’t go in there. These employees knew that bathroom had problem issue and the Plummer had been there working on it that morning and 3 days before that day, The toilet was setting for 24 hours to cure the sealant, but know Jeff they said went in there. On the 5th of September when went to use it, after it worked on Wednesday the 2nd, it flooded. The previous day I fired Lend A Hand Handy man. Jeff came in while my property mgr was showing the house yelling my name and wanting to know why we were mad and ripping painter tape off the walls that showed the damages of their half butt painting job. Then informed me he would put a 2nd coat on. The proceeded to ask how I like the deck. I said it would be great if something was 100% completed. I said why would you paint a bathroom that had not been gutted out yet. I asked what idiot it would tell his employee to do it. No comment from Jeff, except all he cared about was gettin a 5 STAR rating. Oh, the deck will be painted tomorrow (Friday 4th). Friday September I asked Idaho who was suppose to be finishing the deck and the one who painted the ceiling with out a drop cloth what was he doing. Picking up all the wood that had nails and screws in them that had been removed on 8-24-2020, and laid I my yard for 11 days oh and when he removed the steps in between the two decks, he didn’t tape them off for caution to other workers or my property mgr or people looking at the rental property. I asked you are painting the deck no. Why not the deck is wet due to the dew. It was 0830 he said I’m putting second coat of paint on the walls. NO, you are not. You are doing the deck, no the inside of house. NO, you are not. Okay I’ll work on smoothing out the concrete, . So I asked when are you pouring concrete. We’re not that’s what the gravel for. I said I could have bought 2 bags of rocks like I did for my backyard and lay it if I wanted gravel. Oh, it’s better this way. I walked away. Left came back 2 hours later to all the painters tape removed a walls ripped and spackled walls half butt sanding a Idaho brush painting my walls. Contacted Heff who stated “What you want me too do, I’m home sick” and hung up. Idaho said Jeff told him to do this. I fired Idaho and text Jeff Woodcox. This whole deal was $10;012.98 that I paid 1/3rd already that now I will be suing. Do not recommend."
5,It went very well. It was a challenging job due to exposed stone work on one wall and fluted antique wood paneling on other walls.
5,"they did excellant work in record time. i am very, very happy...."
2,"It took a bit of time for them to get the job together, but eventually it was done adequately. The job was performed in August of 2019, and it cost me $425. Now, 7 months later, my masonry work is coming apart and cracking in spots again. For $425 I would expect the job to last longer! I called last week and talked to J R ? and he said they would get back to me. So far NADA. If this wasn't their area of expertise they should have said so and I would have hired someone whose it was."
5,Outstanding customer service! Expectations were exceeded!
5,Being done this day
5,"Great, I highly recommend Lendahandhandyman!"
2,The floors they done were done good . but they took the paint job also not a professional look.
5,Excellent Service! I definitely will use them again.
4,Was told to have mirror cut down but if they had measured the counter top I w not have to. Cost $25 and mirror looks terrible where placed.
4,The work of the Handyman was great.
2,Workmanship was shoddy. They damaged the door they were installing. They damaged the handrail on the steps. The door still doesn’t close right.
1,"Top to bottom the worst handyman experience of my life. Simple tv hang turned into property damage and a 1 hour job took 4. It was bad. They didn’t measure or plan, just kept drilling holes (14 holes for 4 bolts) and winging it. Laughed off my concerns. Scratched my floors. I told them up front I’m a renter and to be very careful-they promised they would and then...yeah. Don’t hire these guys."
4,"good job, and I was happy with the work performance."
5,Did a excellent job
5,It took them a little while but they were very very good. I was really impressed with the tile work.
5,"It was excellent, they showed up, excellent work and cleaned up before they left."
5,Tony was prompt and friendly! Screen looks great!
5,Great! The Team at Louisville Handyman listened to requested and communicated during the projects. They really did a great job delivering quality work!
5,Every aspect of the job. Professional from start to finish.
5,"Louisville Handyman and Remodeling wont be the cheapest estimate you get but the quality and thoroughness of the work performed as well as the care given to make sure you are satisfied with the final product is what the standard for all other contractors should be. At every step of the process we were well informed ahead of time what was going to happen, what was to be expected, and when it was estimated to be finished. The work on my kitchen was amazing and thorough as the technician (Brian) took great pride in the quality of his work. I am already inquiring about work I want done in another room in my home."
1,It still has not been done. Two scheduled appointments have been delayed and now they can't find anyone to do it within a reasonable time. I shall never use Handyman Connection nor Angie's List again.
1,"Talked with owners son and he conveyed that he did not have schedule in front of him and he would call me back in 5 minutes.....NEVR heard back, bush league company!"
5,Sam was very polite and professional. He did a fantastic job. Our front door trim now looks like new! Great job!
5,"Louisville Handyman March 2018 I was very pleased with the work that Louisville Handyman performed, March 2018. I had multiple small to medium sized jobs around the house. All were challenging. I worked c Sam W, and I found him to be not only competent, but skillful. He anticipated and maneuvered past the obstacles that had frustrated me. The price was reasonable for what he did. I considered it a high quality job. My motto has always been, “Quality is rarely cheap, but it is almost always a good value”. Sam did very good quality work at a reasonable price. Sam is also courteous and friendly and easy to work with. Tony Duncan"
5,All work performed was excellent but it was pricey.
5,"From the initial call to schedule an estimate to the finished job, everything was just outstanding with this company. Eric was our estimator and came out about 2 weeks after my initial call (they are pretty booked up, which I can see why). He was on time, very professional, talked us through all of the issues we were inquiring about. After we received the estimate and scheduled the service (about a week later) we had Billy do the repairs. Super nice guy, always showed up on time, and the door looks great. I gave the pricing a ""B"" only because we had two other estimates that were lower, but in this case, you get what you pay for. I will definitely be using this company again and highly recommend to anyone."
4,"I had them out for a quote, but I didn't use them. I asked them for a bathroom and basement refinish. They seemed fine, I didn't go with them though. The customer service was fine. I found better options."
1,"The woman I spoke with over the phone was very rude and unprofessional, and their prices were outrageous."
5,I got an estimate on one day and was scheduled quickly. The technician was nice and very efficient. He got the job done quickly and neatly.
5,"Beautiful Work. The repairs looked better than the original. Louisville Handyman was great to work with. Professional, ontime, work was delivered as agreed and price was reasonable. Still hard to believe that they sent a crew on such short notice when the front door was smashed in and could not be locked."
5,Overall it was a pleasant and professional experience.
5,"Excellent contractor. All work was completed within schedule and budget. Some project creep that was my fault, not theirs, did come up, and they rolled with it perfectly. Will be hiring these guys again."
4,"The work LH provided was very high quality. A true craftsman was assigned to our job. His skills were above and beyond as was his demeanor. He showed great respect for the customer and his/her property, keen attention to detail, excellent craftsmanship. If you want a craftsman to complete your project, you would need to request this one by name. We believe the work was as good as is available for the work performed. If you have the ability to pay the higher prices LH charges and you get their most skilled craftsman, you will likely be very satisfied. The project exceeded the 'estimated' time it would take to complete by 6-8 weeks. Initially receiving a whirlpool tub that would not install in the space was partially to blame. Waited on subs created additional extension of the project. Bathroom cabinetry was also made by superior craftsmen, a sub, initial cabinetry was delivered with the wrong doors and drawers, which was remedied --- it took about 3 additional weeks for new cabinetry to be delivered. Subs damaged one brand new cabinet door minimally, LH made an aesthetic repair but didn't offer replacement. Bath tub was minimally cracked at base, not affecting operation, but still cracked, mostly likely by subs who installed. LH had the tub repaired by a manufacturer's authorized person, and extended the warranty for two years. Cost was at least 25% over bid cost; most increases were do to customer's upgrades, other additional costs were 'hidden' in billing. Sometimes an answer was provided regarding charges, other times, an acceptable answer wasn't provided. I would hire LH again, if my budget allowed."
3,"Basement was finished on time, price seemed a little high. There were some mistakes made when a new copy of the blue print was not given before the work was started. Starting to see nail marks on the ceiling and had to have them comeback and push the carpet back under the wall in some places. My job wasn't the biggest so I didn't always feel valued as a customer. I would use again but only after shopping around and seeing my options. Outside of the doors and wood work every thing else is contracted out."
5,"After reviewing work, we hired him to paint interior of house, repair deck and stain deck, build hand rails in garage and on deck. Slava also repaired front door and painted it."
5,"They did not charge me for a quote. I did not have them do they project as the price was to high, I did not want to over improve for our neighborhood. I would love to use them, I wish I could justify the expense."
5,I couldn't be more pleased with the punctuality and professionalism. Mike introduced himself and explained what he had done when he was finished.
5,technician discovered that the home builder did not properly vent the exhaust fan but he was able to properly and correctly vent the fan
5,It went great. They did a really good job. They have good price and good quality.
3,"It was not very well. They wanted $11,000 for a $4,000 job. They showed up when they were supposed to show up. They were on time."
3,The fixtures and trash drawer were installed.
5,"Sam arrived on time, and was very professional and efficient. We are very happy with the service performed and with the company. We would definitely use them again."
1,Eric told me the job would take 6-8 hours and quoted a price of around $600 and the only way it would be guaranteed is if I had ice guard used. I agreed and someone by the name of John came out. He spent two hours at my home including a 30 minute break John spent sitting in the van. A year and a half later I have water pouring into my bathroom. When I contacted Louisville Handyman I was asked to send pictures of inside and outside and then told skylights are always a problem and that I should remove it and board it up. I was told I would get a call back to figure out what needed to be done and never received a call. I eventually called a roofer and they came out fixed the leak for less money and I haven't had a problem since.
5,"The service was prompt, the quality and people were fantastic!"
5,"I had rotten wood around the garage door. Since it was outside, the company came by while I was away to look at the damage and give a quote on the work. They were willing to work with me to get it done quickly, and were on time and extremely nice when they arrived. We had two gentlemen working for ~4 hours. They acted professionally and quickly, but were still interested in talking like normal people! They even offered to bring me back lunch after their lunch break, and showed me some good fishing spots. The work was beautiful. They replaced the rotten wood and aluminum siding around the garage. They brought me out to see the area causing the issue, explain how they were going to fix it to prevent it from happening again, and had no issues with me asking questions. I even smeared some of their caulking and they were kind enough to fix it for me :) The only iffy part was that they quoted the price in a bid format instead of a quote format, I would ask for a quote next time, to ensure I pay the actual price for the work, not a price based on looking at it for a few minutes."
5,It went well. Really knew what he was talking about.
3,"Eric noticed that we had rotted wood around our doors and windows and at the space under my garage door. I?ve had several people come out and he is the only gentleman who came and did a thorough inspection and he caught it right away. I can?t begin to tell you how good he is. He noticed it along one side and started pressing on the ramping and everything and said it felt ?crunchy? below it. He went onto another and pulled it out and all below was rotted wood. He said that it was in such bad shape that he might have to jack it up; he suggested bringing a contractor out and doing a flat estimate or charging by the hour. It will be a very expensive job, but he has saved my house, and no one else caught it before this. I?ve had Champion Windows and Cunningham Garage Doors as well as Handy Pro and Bright Pest Control and none of them noticed it, even when I pointed out some of the rotted wood to HandyPro. Eric from Global Handyman has saved my house. I don?t know if it was water damage, termites or carpenter ants, but it has done a number on my home, but he caught it, and I am so pleased. He deserves accolades all around for catching something no one else has found yet. He is very professional, well-bred and well-mannered, I can?t say enough about him. He?s a good, honest, man. ----UPDATE When it came to my bill he sent the price of $700, when had the other guy come out Eric came back and said ""Great you have steel, concrete, it may not cost as much as I thought"". Once the bill came it was double. He said I hadn't answered his emails and I said I was shocked and didn't know what to say. The price was DOUBLE. How can he say it will be cheaper and then double it?"
5,The person that came out and did the estimate was absolutely accurate as far as the time and the cost. The job the gentleman did was high quality.
4,"Gutter vendor did ok job, but left after job and never allowed us time to inspect. Garage vendor was good and professional, but work done was less than what we expected. Patio vendor was very good."
3,Very responsive and on time appointment for quote. They wanted a 50 percent deposit for minor repair handyman type work. I felt uncomfortable with this way of doing business. Too much risk for the customer. If high dollar parts were involved then maybe.
2,"We were charged almost $300 to reattach a piece of trim that had come away from the brick siding near the peak of our house. Mike showed up on time and after some time trying to figure out how to do this, he made a trip to the store for supplies that he did not have on his van. He reattached the trim using some caulk, and 4 tap con screws that he had to go get from the store. For that effort we were charged almost $300. He was very personable, however, my wife and I could not believe that he didn't have the necessary items on board, and that we were charged for him to go to the store. Not only was the cost of the supplies outrageous, so was the rate we were charged. We will not be using this company again for other projects we have, and I will not be recommending them to others as well."
5,"This company is responsive, quick, and will follow up if I have any questions after the job.? Their workmanship is thorough and professional."
5,"Eric was punctual, friendly and knowledgeable. He said that Sam was the guy for the job. Sam was right on time, very professional and a nice. The wood beneath the stained glass had rotted (being quite old) and the window had slipped down a few inches leaving a gap at the top. Sam removed the old wood and the window and showed me how to clean the window of the gunk it had collected using a razor blade tool he provided. After rebuilding the window frame with new wood, he added a layer of glass to provide further insulation and to protect the stained glass. The finished product is just beautiful! I couldn't be happier. Also, he loaned me some wood glue to fix a broken chair and added a vice tool to hold the wood in place while it dried. I honestly have no idea whether the price was good or not since I've never had that type of work down before. But regardless, I would hire them again."
5,It went well. He was a little difficult to schedule with as he was so slammed with Angie's list.
5,Great to work with. Punctual. Fast work and well done. Very good at correcting my mistakes.
4,people doing the work are very good and profession. our only criticism is the price charged is very high. Louisville handyman takes a higher margin for subcontracting the work than most companies. we will not be using them again.
4,"The quality of the work was very good and on par or better than the existing construction on our 6-7 year old 4,000 s.f.+ home. We were especially pleased with the quality of work with regards to custom wood trim. The employees of Louisville Handyman were professional and communicated well regarding any problems or changes that had to be made during the work. L.H. contracted the paint and drywall work. It took a lot of effort from us to get the custom finish the way that we wanted in the bar area, and there was some drywall work done that was not completed to our satisfaction that had to be redone. I am very happy overall with the quality of the work. The price was fair, but was not cheap. You get what you pay for. However, I would say that, for the money, I should not have had to work as hard as I did to get the contracted work completed to our sastisfaction. The owner of the company was not as responsive as he could have been, forcing me to follow up on issues instead of taking care of them himself. I expected L.H. to be all over any issues and that wasn't always the case. That aspect of the project could have been better. I would still recommend the company, especially the work of the employees of L.H.. They are true craftsmen."
5,"I have used Lvl Handyman for several years and have complete confidence in their talents, workmanship, professionalism, and results."
5,Arrived as scheduled and completed repairs in two days with a high degree of professionalism. Job went smoothly. Doors work like like new and leak appears to be fixed.
5,"Louisville Handyman's office was easy to deal with, set a scheduled date & time that worked for me. John the seviceman showed up went right to work & had the job taken care of very quickly. He looked ed at other repairs that he assured me could be taked care of which I will be scheduling shortly. Good company."
5,"Joe came out to give a free estimate to screen in a porch that required two sides to be screened. His estimate was $2500 to complete this job. He was very friendly and seemed knowledgeable and came up with some good ideas on how to handle the work. However, we did not choose him to do this project due to the price. I guess as a first time home-owner I sometimes get ""sticker shock""!"
5,Joe was very particular with all details. He even had the carpet removed to prevent it from being damaged. He was careful which subcontractors he used to cut the the hole in the basement wall. Gas and water lines had to be rerouted in order to dig the hole for the egress window.
5,"They did a really good job. We had a problem with out back door where water starts standing and it rotted the wood around the door frame, they replaced it. It seems to be expensive but they did it correctly. They used the proper wood for weather. We've been very happy with their work."
5,"A frozen bathtub pipe burst during the first polar vortex. The bathroom and adjoining closet and bedroom had always been cold in the winter and hot in the summer. The plumber who fixed the pipe suggested we look into additional insulation for the wall around the pipe and in the ceiling over the tub. We called Louisville Handyman, because our pipes to the bathroom had frozen again after repair of the broken one. Craig from Louisville Handyman came out the next morning and quickly added the insulation. He had loaded everything he needed on the truck for the service run. He was friendly, professional, and efficient. We quickly felt the improvement in the temperature of the bath and adjoining rooms after the improved insulation, and are ready now for the next polar vortex round of freezing temperatures. Craig and Louisville Handyman gave us our peace of mind back, since we had taken turns throughout the day and night blowing a hairdryer over the frozen pipes to prevent another broken pipe until the insulation could be added. We will use Louisville Handyman again."
5,They did a great job and they are professional.? They called and showed up on time and did everything they said they would do.
5,"The provider, Sam, was on time and very neat. What looked like a simple cut-out turned out to be anything but simple. The original cabinetry had been custom built around the cooktop/stove leaving a non-standard space for a standard sized gas range. Sam expertly re-engineered my cabinet in order to shave the half inch necessary to make the range fit. I had thought I was going to lose the functionality of a drawer and a shelf in my cabinet but he not only spared the drawer but he expertly re-sized the shelf in my cabinet to accommodate the half inch he took off. When you look in the cabinet in question, you cannot tell he was even there. He was quick, precise, and very clean. As I learned during the time he was here, he is the one Lowes and Home Depot refer customers to who realize their new appliances don't fit when they get them home. Sam's carpentry work was amazing. I look forward to using him and Louisville Handyman for my future remodeling and handyman needs."
5,"Results were dramatic! Eric Thornton has genuine talent. I had a list of improvements I wanted for the kitchen, but Eric supplied the ""vision."" I didn't want to overspend on this small house, and he made recommendations In keeping with the budget. I wanted to use Greg Bilyeu for painting the room and cabinets and Son of a Carpenter for the flooring, and Eric made all the timing work. I was very busy with a renovation at work, so my home project was not my top priority, but Eric did not let that impact the necessary communication. We texted and messaged quite a bit, which I appreciate. I'll let the photos say the rest!"
5,Everything done to high standards. Excellent workmanship.
4,"I spoke with the owner at a home remodeling and lawn/gardening show. I had noted their presence at several shows, which to me was a good sign of the company's potential for good work. i spoke with the owner over lunch at the show and had intended to explore further the 3 projects I had in mind, bathroom remodel, kitchen remodel, and construction of a 2000 sq ft shop/garage/storage building. However, after discussion, I felt that the building construction might be beyond the scope of this contractor, so I decided to look elsewhere. It wasn't anything that the owner said or didn't say, just a feeling on my part. In the future, if I have need of a contractor for a remodeling project, I will certainly give Louisville Handyman Inc. another look."
3,They were expensive. The quality of work was okay.
3,I did not use this company.
5,Perfect experience. Reasonably priced.
2,"Called Louisville Handyman to make a small repair to a few pieces of vinyl siding that were coming. Repairs were requested due to home inspection of house pending sale. Person who came out said we also needed several other areas repaired. We said no, only fix what was noted on home inspection. Once on the ladder he said the siding in question was not installed correctly and that he would need additional parts and labor to fix. We again said no, only fix what was noted. He grudgingly complied saying without the extra parts and labor he would not guarantee the work. I called the builder, Ball Homes, and they dispute the claims made by Louisville Handyman."
5,"It went superb. I have been out of reach for about a month due to personal reasons, and he called me back to check up on me. He went above and beyond the call of duty."
4,They showed up on time and did what they said they were going to do. Their prices also stayed the same as their quote but they might have been a little high.
5,"They showed up on time and did a great job under very adverse conditions. It was wet and cold. They tore off the decking, repaired joists and put new decking back on. It took 3 days as they promised. Cleaned up very well."
4,"I called the company based on Angie's list reviews; they were evidently very busy, and so even the estimate date was several weeks in the future, but that didn't matter. The woman I talked to was very polite and precise about dates and making sure we were both on the same page. On the estimate date I received a call a little bit before the actual time, asking if he could come a little early as he was in the area. He arrived promptly, I showed him what needed to be done--a wooden awning had the spokes on one side starting to bow out in an unstable fashion, and some wooden 'soffits' on the front porch had some slats that were starting to sag; I thought the wood was rotten and would need replacing, but he said not. He said it looked like 'a couple hours' work'. He was very pleasant and professional, and the whole thing took less than ten minutes. The estimate was $390, which seemed a little high, but at the time I thought it included some painting of the areas (I found out later I had mistaken something he said, but this was not a big deal, as I can paint things myself). I agreed, and we set up a time for the following week. Again, the man who showed up (not the estimator) came on time, and was very pleasant, and as far as I know did the work competently (the awning spokes are back in line, anyway). The thing that bothered me, was that it turned out the materials for the job seemed to consists of some screws (or nails, maybe) and caulk; and it took him less than 45 minutes. In light of this the estimate seemed to me so expensive, that though I went ahead and paid it without saying anything, I eventually emailed the company to let them know what I thought, and received back a prompt reply explaining how this was a perfectly reasonable price, but offering me either a $75 refund or $150 off my next project (which I had asked them to estimate before the original one had been completed). I chose the $75 since I had decided to cancel the other project, and this brought my closing cost down to the $315.00 listed elsewhere. My dismay at the cost may have been, in part, because I have been spoiled by jobs done by my previous carpenter, who worked only for himself, and thus had I suppose fewer expenses, and could afford to charge $350 for a job that took him most of the day and used considerably more materials (Howard, why, oh why did you have to move to CO??). In summary, Louisville Handyman is a very well run company with great communication skills, responsiveness, and punctuality, but in this economy, I personally need a better hourly rate!"
4,"I think they would have done a good job but I did not go with them. The person who came was very professional. At that time I just felt that their bid was a little higher. But after having the work done, I thought that their prices were probably very realistic. I would rate them very highly as far as their promptness and professionalism based only on the quote experience I had with them."
4,Used Josh and his service for a couple of small repairs and a door installation. He did a through job on each task and did not cut corners. Had a minor issue with the finish on a door installation but he came back promptly and made corrections. I would recommend him for any small handyman work or repairs.
4,"The price was reasonable. It was a good experience. The service was good. It was really, really fast. I am pleased."
2,"It was a bad meeting, the job would have not bee done by this company. I got someone else to put in my door."
5,"I had ideas about what I wanted, and the people where eager to listen to what I wanted; when I wasn't sure which way to turn, they had lots of ideas to help me sort it all out. I worked with Angela (cabinets), Dixie (flooring) and Mike (appliances) and they were all extremely knowledgeable and patient. It took a while (about 2 months) and I hated living without a kitchen for all that time, but I understand that is pretty much standard. When it was all over, I definitely felt it was worth it."
5,He was on time. I bought all the fixtures and had them all ready so he didn't have to go to get parts. He showed up and did the work.
5,"I needed an estimate for a bathroom remodel that was already half finished, but abandoned. This company was prompt and professional, and upfront about the challenges and cost of finishing work started by others. Although I did not hire this company for this project, I felt confident about the details and price of their quote, and would seek quotes on future projects."
5,"Josh began by doing several small handyman jobs for me. He does good work, his prices are fair, and he's trust worthy. My house needed painting and he bid on that and gave me a very fair price. His crew was very neat and I'm very pleased with the whole paint job. So, when there is anything I need done at my house (whatever size job) - Josh is the man!"
5,"Their people were really professional, friendly and nice. The only thing I didn't like was when I had them first out there was that they didn't actually get up on the roof to look around. We had already been up there and I kind of told them different things that were wrong. I didn't like the idea that they didn't get up there and look for themselves. That was the only thing I didn't like. I think overall they were nice."
5,"He is wonderful, the most wonderful contractor in the world. He did more in one day than some of these others do in a whole year. They always walked out before the job was done. He is the one. I don't think I will ever need another. He is too good. I have been taken by so many other people that's why I like Angie's List."
4,"First man came out to my mom's house to find out the problem. No one got on the roof to look around he was just going by what I told him. They e-mailed out a quote, which I accepted and was asked to give half down. Then we scheduled an appointment which was very timely. The handyman that came was very pleasant and did a great job but going back to what I said about no one getting on the roof, they missed a vent pipe. But it turned out fine they sent another truck out with the extra part. i was very happy with this company and would use them again."
5,Excellent. Identified further issues and project completed on time and on estimate. Look forward to working with them again.
5,He arrived on time. Quickly assessed the need and completed the work. Also wanted him to do small plumbing job but he said he could not do it.
4,"He came out a couple of years ago to give me a quote, but I thought it was too high. I really didn't have any opinion either way, the reason I didn't choose him was because he was too high."
4,"The service sent out a man who was extremely nice and very prompt, he complimented my work but ended up having to take down most of the drywall to fix the seams. His work was excellent, however since it was only a 2' by 14' section and I had all the materials and had performed all the demo and structure build looking back I can't see why it cost $600. I've recently had some work performed by another company that involved a major gut and re-drywall and their prices were far better then this cost was. He was very prompt, he even showed up one morning when the roads had ice on them and many businesses and schools were closed. He parked his van in my driveway and when he stepped out and closed the door the van actually slid out of the driveway into the road, it was bad, but he was not only prompt he was about 15 minutes early. He seemed to really care about his work."
5,"They make you pay for a full hour of $110 before they would even come out and then it was $70 after that. They will do just about anything for that price. I had him look at remaking my banister in the house. I had this particular gentleman come in and do it another time because he is very busy with the electrical, but he does that too. I think he is really great. His is really painless service, just one person because he is good. I think they are kind of expensive. I have already used them before and will use them in the future."
5,They were great and did it in half an hour. He spoke to his boss to help reduce the price.
5,"Crew did a thorough job on the repair.?When they came for the first visit, they advised that the area had not completely dried and suggested holding off on the repair for a week to allow an remaining moisture to dry out. ?When they returned, they were able to coordinate all of the work, between drywall and painting in a narrow window of time."
5,"They were prompt, punctual, responsive and got the job done efficiently. We were very pleased with their level of professionalism and expertise."
5,They were very professional. They set up an appointment and were on time. It went well. Their estimate was pretty high. I would use them in the future.
5,"We ended up not using this company, as we did some of the work ourselves, but I was very impressed by this company's response, the professional contract and estimate, and most of all by the follow-up calls to see if we had the work completed and/or if we had any other needs or questions about the remodel work that we did."
1,The response to my request for an estimate was initially very good. I received a call and the handyman showed up on time. My son talked to him about what needed to be done. My son said the gentleman was very polite and seemed very professional. The handyman told my son that an estimate would be emailed to me in a few days. Never received an email or an estimate and never heard from him again.
3,"I was called at 1 pm and told Louisville Handyman Inc?was running late for my 12:30-1:00 appointment for an estimate of deck install/roof/door replacement. We discussed him coming later that afternoon but was unable to set a time due to his schedule and mine. This was ok and I said we can make appointment another day. Then the odd thing was he asked if I had other estimates already. We reviewed the work I needed done. He said he asked because his company would probably not be comparable to the other estimates. If I understood correctly, there was a set $635/day plus $75/hr. Being on a fixed income and the?economy, cost was of course a major factor. ?I told him that seemed very high and he said it was due to the number of workers on the job and what they were paid, gas prices and length of time on the job. I thanked him for his time and told him I would not be needing his services."
5,"Appointment made over the telephone. The service person Sam arrived on the exact time and date. He did an excellent replacement of the damaged drywall. Once compound was applied and dried. He painted the area and it is now impossible to tell where the repair was made. He cleaned up his work area, was very thorough and professional. We will continue to use this company in the future."
5,"After we agreed to the price, the planning began. From the start date, everyone involved showed up exactly when they said they would. All of the work was completed as planned. Eric was involved from the beginning to make sure all was on schedule and that there were no problems. I could call Eric at any time with questions or concerns and he was very responsive and always went out of his way to make sure that we were pleased. The main person working on our kitchen, Philip, was an excellent carpenter and very skilled at all that he did. He was pleasant to have in our home and my children loved having him there. From start to finish, they got the job done quickly and with quality. Couldn't have gone any better. I will use them again on our next project. I have a beautiful kitchen and am very pleased."
5,There were some leaking pipes. They fixed that leak and cut some holes in the wall and patch them up. The guy that came to do the job was really nice. He did a great job. The work he did looks good. I felt they were a little expensive based on another quote we got. I will consider using them in the future again.
5,Great experience. I have now used Louisville Handyman three times. I have always had prompt and professional service. Would definitely recommend this company and I will use them again.
5,"Louisville Handyman was extremely professional, yet wonderfully personable. I definitely got my money's worth! I'm a very inexperienced homeowner, had just moved to a new town, and had a long list of ""little things"" from the home inspection report. Eric Thornton, the estimator, was terrific! He helped me prioritize the home inspection items and had some really helpful suggestions. His empathy far exceeded my expectations, and he was genuinely friendly toward my dogs. After his visit, we communicated very effectively by e-mail. My projects were scheduled about a month after Eric's visit, which didn't meet my expectations, but I can easily see why their services are in demand. They pride themselves on the knowledge and experience of their professionals, so they are selective about who they add to the team--also obvious to me now. On the first morning of my two-day project, Sam arrived on time, was very thorough discussing his plan for my closet, asked plenty of questions about my needs, and also was genuinely patient meeting my barking dogs. He offered to let them out during the day, assured me he would be very careful they wouldn't get out except into their fenced yard. When I arrived home, everything was in order, and my closet was AMAZING!! I instantly realized that I had been in the presence of carpentry greatness that morning, and had hardly challenged Sam's abilities at all. When Sam returned the next morning--again promptly--we admired the closet together, he seemed pleased that it meets my needs. We discussed some projects I would complete on my own, and he made product recommendations and suggestions. Sam had warned me that I needed to try to add more tasks to my list than he could complete in a day, in order make the most of my time. I was so happy to find how many things he was able to accomplish and the attention to detail throughout. I will use them again without hesitation, and am actively working to dream-up carpentry projects for Sam!"
1,I did not appreciate the extreme price they quoted me.
5,"They were good, but, were on the expensive side. I may use their services in the future."
5,He did the work in the most cost-effective way possible. He was very good and very reasonably priced. I was expecting a much bigger deal. He came up with a good common sense and effective solution. I like his service and the way he operates. He tries to the best of his ability to give his honest opinion. He's an excellent carpenter who uses his time efficiently. I loved him. I would use him again.
5,He did an excellent job. I had no complaints. I didn't price anywhere else; I just wanted it done. He was very responsive and came at the time he said he would. He was very professional. I would absolutely use him again.
5,I have used them in the past. They are excellent. I would not hesitate to use them again. They were prompt and gave reasonable bids. They were generally able to stay within their bid amount. They do high quality work.
5,"It entailed a lot of work and it was a good quote. We just didn't use their services. Just by talking to them and having them come out to my house and give me an estimate, they were very professional. If I could have afforded the quote, I would have used them. They were too expensive. They have a really good reputation as far as I could tell from Angie's List and just from other sources around here. They were very responsive. Actually, the president of the company came out and did the quote for me. I was very impressed with what I saw of them. They had 3 of their top guys come out and examine my house and what I was asking to have done. They called back to me within 3 days of being at my house. If I could afford them, I would use them in the future."
3,"Came and gave an estimate,arrived when stated. I mailed a deposit in and set appointment time for work. Handyman arrived without supplies he needed. Went shopping for light and stucco mix, got wrong kind of mix. Installed light and went to get correct mix. When he got back it was to late and was starting to rain. Said he would be back. Ten days or more later after some calls to see where he was, he returned and finished the job. His work was good, I asked how much I owed and he gave me a total and I wrote a check for balance due. A month later I received a bill for almost double what I had written the check for, when I called the office and spoke to Brian he said he would check with the person who did the work and find out about the check I had written that had not been deposited. Two weeks later I call again as I hadn't heard from Brian. He stated he had paperwork in front of him and would get right back with me. Four days later Brian called and wanted me to stop payment on check and issue a new one which I immediately did. I ask Brian why the handyman had not came with supplies he needed and why he wanted to charge me for hours he used while shopping. Estimate said for time and supplies. I thought that was for time worked. The check was for original total the handyman had said was balance in full. I think their estimate needs to clarify the terms more clearly. They give a bid for a specific job and should come prepared to do that job."
5,Excellent - Dan looked at all of the jobs and determined which tools to bring in from the truck and the order in which to do all jobs. He was very efficient and professional.
5,"Very well. When I called I was promptly given an estimate (in this case time and materials) and a date for the work to be performed. The repairman showed up promptly, worked quickly and efficiently. He did a very high quality job and cleaned up when he was done."
1,No one ever came
5,The handyman did an excellent job
5,Can not tell it was ever there!
5,It went very well
3,Didn't use
5,Great as always!
5,Great.
3,"The bookshelves were built to our satisfaction. The work was of very good quality. The craftsmen were polite and efficient. Unfortunately, they spilled oil based paint in our driveway at the beginning of the job. The stain was finally removed after 6 months had elapsed. They attempted to clean it with chemical methods, all of which failed (and killed some new sod to boot). Eventually, a light sand blast was required to remove the stain. I feel the response to this was extremely poor. It should have been addressed immediately after the spill, not 6 months later (and a few calls to prod them to do it)."
5,"THEY WERE PROMPT, POLITE AND EASY TO WORK WITH. THEY DID A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS WHILE THEY WERE THERE AND THEY WORKED VERY QUICKLY IN THE TIME THAT THEY WERE THERE."
2,I can't recommend them.
4,They were good.
3,NO est. no work
5,They performed the work just fine.
5,great
5,"He is reliable, he is prompt. He is cooperative to add a project that originally not on the list. He is fun to work with. He is flexible and agreeable. His talent are diverse. His pricing reasonable. I would recommend him without hesitation.."
5,Great! Very professional and prompt.
4,"Could have been better, really should not have taken 3 days."
5,"Mr. Hammond and his employee were very professional. We had them install siding and windows and then had them do some drywall and trim work. We were on vacation, Mr. Hammond’s work exceeded our expectations, work and cleanup were done when we got home. Would definitely hire him again!"
1,call did not go through. Can’t say I would hire again never got to hire them the first time. I called Takl.
3,"Declined to do concrete work, though they replied to my request promptly."
5,Excellent job will definitely use them again
5,"Mr. Hammond and his assistant stayed focused on their work but were friendly and helpful. They cleaned up after their work and left the house as they found it, but better. I will definitely call on Mr. Hammond for my next jobs."
1,"Took several days to call me, then came out to give me a quote but said he would have to email it to me in the next few days. I’ve never had anyone not be able to give me a quote on the spot. So, seven days later I got the quote & I asked when he would be available to do the work. He was supposed to get back to me in a few days again to schedule something for the next week. Well, it’s now the end of the next week & I haven’t heard a thing from him. I’ve already hired someone else for the job who called me back, gave me a quote & came to do the work all within two days."
5,"Mr. Hammond and his assistant did a first-rate job and accommodated my time constraints. I thought their price was reasonable. The man whom I engaged through Angie's list FIRST was a total disappointment. He tied up the first day calling at the end of the day. He was just there to look over the job. He said he would get in touch with me the next day...his schedule had become to busy to do the work that day. He only called me and came after it was dark the next day, and he did not seem to know how to do the work. He said that an address plaque had to be secured by a bolt that screwed in at two directions. He did not center of finish drilling holes. He was foul-mouth and crude. HE said that he would come the next day, day 3. He acted like I could drop classes and other obligations for him to come ""sometime"" the next day. I told him that if he could not get me into his schedule after two days, I did not want to wait more time to have the whole thing be bumped into a third day. He struck me as being unscrupulous, and he talked about bigger jobs being his main consideration because they paid more. He was proposing that I set aside a whole third day for him to maybe be able to be there to do the work. I said that the arrangement did not suit me. He said that I needed to get someone else to do the work then and hung up on me. I would NEVER call that man to do work for me. He was unreliable, crude, temperamentally unsuited to deal with people, and appeared to be unscrupulous. Hanging up on someone who does not let the small job be bumped into a third day was a deal breaker. The guy's name was ""Larry"" and he worked at the Jeff Davis company in southern Indiana, which is in southern Indiana. Please do not name me as the person who gave him a bad report. I found the man scary. I would give the man low marks in honesty, reliability, sociability, and know-how. I would never call his company again. The review below is for David Hammond, the second man whom I called through Angie's list, did a fine job installing my address plaque and remounting a garage rack. I was very accommodating and did a fine job. I would call for him again."
5,David was very responsive and did a great job. I wouldn't hesitate to contact him in the future for larger jobs.
5,"The work was done well, on time, professionally at a reasonable cost."
5,"Always stayed in contact with us, always on time and very flexible which was very important."
5,Great they were in and out and knew exactly what to do.
5,They finished quickly and worked to make sure it was turning out how I envisioned.
5,"David is a honest and hard-working guy. He and a helper did a really good job repairing some rotten trim and soffit, painting the exterior wood and installed a new backdoor I purchased at home Depot. The price was more than fair and there were no surprises even though the door required more work than expected. He always notified me prior to arriving which was nice. I appreciate David's work and will not hesitate to use him again."
5,He and his helper were very friendly and considerate. they arrived on time and got to work immediately. They were knowledgeable and exacting. We thought it was charming that David whistled while he was working. He knows his stuff. Was a perfectly perfect experience and I couldn't be happier. We will definitely use him again!!
5,"Good quality work, prompt, cleaned up after. Friendly and courteous. In one instance where mortar was dripped onto the sidewalk, he came back with a wire brush to clean it up."
5,Great! Excellent work restoring our barn and building the large compost bins. Very pleasant to work with and work is xcellent.
5,Great. This was a very small job and they were willing to do it. The price was right for the work required.
5,"I have used We Can Do LLC on several projects over the past few years. To date, I have never been disappointed with quality nor cost of their services. They are polite, reliable, pay attention to details, and pick up after themselves. I would recommend them without any reservations."
5,"Dave arrived on time and began working on the deck. Not only did he tear down the deck but also took all the debris with him. Job took about 4.5 hours. He did discover that additional wood would be needed for the job due to more extensive wood rot. He secured the additional supplies and still finished the job on time as promised. The quoted price did go up however even with the increase, the price was within our range and the finished product was well constructed."
5,"I found David Hammond's services (We Can Do. LLC) through Angie's List and was very happy with his professionalism and the quality of the work he completed for us. Not only was he personable, upon first contacting him he happened to be available for an onsite estimate the same day! Our front entryway job included drywalling 3 adjacent surfaces, retexturing the replaced section of ceiling, reframing the door with trim, and replacing the entryway ceiling light fixture. The project was tidy and completed over two consecutive days, despite the drying time for multiple layers of mudding and sanding. In addition, the end cost matched the initial estimate and though I always got an answering machine when I called, David consistently replied within the hour (usually within 30 min!) and communication remained good. He came to do the job on the days he said he would, and even called on those mornings ahead of arrival. Mr. Hammond is definitely at the top of our list for our next home repair/improvement job."
5,David returned call with a prompt estimate. When we decided to go with him he was prompt and reliable. He did the work just as he promised and there were zero surprises. David performed the type of work you expect from a professional but rarely get these days.
5,"We have used several handyman services in the past. David Hammond is the best of the group. He is prompt, professional and pleasant. Quietly gets the job done, and the price is reasonable and fair. It is a good feeling to know we have David Hammond when we need a handyman and then some."
5,"David was very responsive and after the initial estimate, he was able to make it out about two weeks later. The job lasted 3 days and everything was completed as I had expected. This is the second time I've used him and I will call again if I need anything else done."
2,Called twice and never got called back. Suck.
5,"Punctual, performed work exactly as agreed, nice guys. Doors look great!"
5,"The owner, David Hammond, provided a detailed, written estimate of the job. After the estimate was accepted, we agreed on a time to complete the work. David met the schedule. He called before his employee and he arrived. Both worked steadily to complete the job and were skilled, knowledgeable and respectful. My husband and I were very happy with the work and would recommend We Can Do to anyone."
5,"This was new construction. a bedroom for our 3 year old grand daughter. They worked quickly, were fun to have around and never minded that they were under the watchful eye of a three year old supervisor. Great work, careful cleanup."
5,David was pleasant to work with and did an excellent job on screening in our patio.
5,They came out the day that I called. They contacted me one hour before they arrived. Cleaned up there mess and gave me an approximate coat before they arrived. I will definitely contact this company again.
5,"This was the second time we used Mr. Hammond's services. The first time, was to remodle an old bathroom that required a replacement bathtub and shower, sink, new tile floor, exhaust fan, and replastering. Our experience this time around with Mr. Hammond was no less favorable than the first one. He proved himself to be a courteous and experienced professional in his line of work. On a couple of occasions he made suggestions that saved us time or money toward the completion of the project. He also took pains to keep the dust level in the house to a minimum. Should we need the services of a skilled handyman in the future Mr. Hammond would be the first person I would call. On both occasions he did a great job for us."
5,"David of We Can Do, LLC arrived precisely on-time. Appeared he had all the materials and tools needed from his previous estimate. David carefully moved our clothes dryer closer to the exterior vent, and he explained why - a shorter vent pipe means less lint thereby reducing fire hazard. He removed the old 15-foot long vent (aluminized plastic) and replaced it with corrugated aluminum - greatly improving the fire resistance. Surprisingly he also used brackets instead of spring clamps to attach the new vent pipe to the dryer and the exhaust. He explained this should solve the problem we had with the old vent piping disconnecting from the dryer due to vibrations. Overall, most pleased. We Can Do is slightly more expensive than other handyman services. However, David listened to my concerns and needs, solved each one, and explained what and why he did something."
3,"They returned a phone call to came to give an estimate promptly. The job was $650 which sounded a bit high, but I just wanted it done, and quickly so I could get everything put back together! They told me that they thought they would be able to do the work the next week. Then it turned out to be the next week, then the next. I had to call them to find out about the rescheduling. In the meantime, they did give me the name of another person to do some other work around my house that I needed done that they didn't do. I called him and he came and gave me estimates, one them was for some of the same work and it was literally 1/2 the price--to remove and replace 6 planks on my front porch/deck. ""We Can Do"" gave me an estimate of $120, the other guy $60. The new guy did that job fortunately, but drywall wasn't his area. Anyway, the drywall was done, done promptly, and done well when they came. They were there each day (it had to dry after each day) first thing in the morning and called each time to say they were on their way. Again, their drywall was good. However, in the iiving room, they pulled up the carpet tack strip to take out (or replace, I'm not sure which) the drywall, and when they did it left big holes/divits in the concrete. When we called them about it, they did come back to repair them, but they said that they thought that when the carpeting people came to lay the carpeting back down they figured that they would fix it! It was fixed, but David didn't seem happy about making the trip to do so. I'm not too picky, I mean, I am, it's my house, but the little details can impress, or unimpress me. Like, they didn't fix the concrete, they didn't put outlet covers back on the walls, I had to touch up paint where they didn't when they put the trim back up in the living room."
4,"He Informed me that he doesn't do work in the Old Louisville Area. This is neither a positive or negative review, just informational."
5,"The work went well, he was on time, neat & everything was done professionally. He brought the necessary trim & matching paint & the garage doors look great. The faucet works well, no drips or leaks. I'm going to be using his service in the future."
5,Everything they did was very good.
1,"We chose We Can Do depending on the Angie's List ratings. I called and left a message several days passed and he called and left a message. I called and left a message several days passed and he called and left a message. I called to respond and could not leave a message. I understand being busy. However, not even responding to a possible client or making an attempt is not professional."
4,Response took a few days. I wanted laminate flooring installed. They don't do this type of work.
5,They were very dependable. They did high quality work. Scheduling was kind of slow but they would call and check in with me.
5,Scheduled appt. and repairs were done quickly and for the price agreed to
5,"He was there when he said he would be. He finished when he said he would, The job was great, he cleaned up after himself and was very forthright with his communications. a great experience, (which does not happen often) I WILL use him again"
5,"I found We Can Do through Angie's Big Deal, and things have turned out really great. Following a call to explain and arrange a time, David came and estimated how long it would take (the deal was for two man hours of work), and then has come back to patch the walls. David is still going to come back one more time and sand and then paint the repairs being made, but has been waiting on me to get the matching paint. He's been very friendly, yet professional, and excellent with communication. That is something that often frustrates me with contractors - not communicating when they can arrive or following up with return calls. That hasn't been a problem at all with We Can Do. Pending the outcome of the sanding and painting, I am definitely planning to use them again when I need handy-man work done. I especially also appreciate that he's been willing to make three separate trips - the 2nd one was to cut out small pieces of the walls that had been repaired so I could get an accurate paint match) for the discounted work."
5,"David was prompt to show when he came for the estimate. Initially we were just going to do the deck doors (the seal was broken on one) but I also got an estimate to enclose the bottom of the deck. He had an excellent idea, to use T-111 wood siding, which we will stain in the spring....a much cheaper alternative that hadn't occurred to us. He and his partner/helper did a great job, were kind and considerate the entire time, cleaned up after themselves, and could not have been any better. We intend to call David again when we need a handyman. I highly recommend him!"
5,"David was good about calling when he was on his way to my house. Since he is only about 15 minutes away, this was very helpful. He was careful about covering the surrounding areas with drop cloths before beginning the sanding. Tthe job was finished to my complete satisfaction. David was professional, attentive to details, and pleasant to work with. He made friends with my dog who was always happy to see him arrive. I will definitely call upon him in the future."
5,"Great experience, will use 'We Can Do' again.Prompt and courteous. Always called before coming over. Very satisfied."
5,"He and his helper were very friendly and did a good job. I had a problem about a week later with one of the door knobs and he came out the same day and fixed it immediately. Then I had a question about something else and called him and he responded the same day, answered my question and was very professional"
5,Our bathroom upstairs had a leaking and stained the ceiling over the kitchen area. So we wanted to have it repainted. I have tried a few handymen and neither wanted to take the job because it was a small job and required multiple trips. Dave gladly accepted it and did a wonderful job.
4,David was reliable and good to work with. We went back and forth on ideas about completing the project and he was patient through the process and did a good job
5,All services were performed in a timely manner with very professional personnel. David was very fast and courteous as was his helper. I will use them again as things arise in the house.
5,"Fantastic. Easy to schedule. Easy to work with. Nice job done, reasonable rates. Will gladly work with again!"
5,"David did a fantastic job - we couldn't be more pleased. He was hardworking and honest in his dealings. He did a lot of work in a short period of time, I'm certain we would have paid twice as much with a different provider. He took on our BIG problems with ease and make them look like small issues. We will definitely use him again as we need other things done around the house."
5,David called soon after I purchased the coupon from Angie's List and scheduled a time to come and see what I needed done. He took all the measurements for purchasing and installing a banister to my basement on a concrete wall. He returned about a week later and completed the work in about 45 minutes. I am beyond pleased with the job he did.
5,"The contractor was very efficient in attempting to fix the existing fixture. After determining that we would need a replacement, we were able to find the same model at Home Depot. Mr. Hammond responded very quickly in another trip to our home to install the new fixture.We were very pleased with the response time and the effort made to fix the old fixture."
5,"I have several rental properties and David has done several projects for me. He does a very good job , is always professional. I know I can trust him to get the job doe correctly the first time without any follow up on my part."
5,He came and was only here for 1 hr. He got everything I needed and is going to come back for the other hour at a later date. I really didn't even have to make an appointment with him; he was just that prompt.
4,We are remodeling a house that we just purchased. I called We Can Do and spoke with David Hammond the owner. We set up a time for a review for an estimate. Well it was about a week later than he said but he came a provided us with an estimate. After getting a few other estimates we decided to use We Can Do. I had removed most of the wallpaper in the dining room but the drywall was damaged and the wallpaper backing remained. The first layers of the drywall came off in places. In the kitchen we removed a back splash and it also made a mess of the drywall. Same problems in 2 baths. David showed up when he said he would and he and his helper worked a very long day that first day. While they were working I pointed a few other small drywall problems and asked if they would repair them and move an electrical wire for a light in the pantry. They fixed them all. They covered the hardwood floors and cleaned up each day. They came back 2 more days and finished the work. The drywall is ready for priming. Even after the extra work they did for me the final bill came in under estimate. I would highly recommend them and will use them again if I need any drywall work done. I've got a basement that needs to be finished.
1,It took too long to set an appointment to come out and obtain an estimate. Finally set an appointment and they came out to look at my house. They told me they would have the estimate to me the following Monday but it has now been over a week and a half since they came out and still no estimate.
5,David was on time and very professional. He worked hard and did very nice work. He left the work sight clean. I received good value for the money spent. I will hire them in the future and I highly recommend them to anyone. I have him on speed dial.
2,Wanted some dywall repaired. Left email and phone messages never recived a call back
5,"It went very well--I was so pleased to get this long-standing nuisance taken care of in such a short time. I estimate he was here a bit less than an hour. He charged by the job, not the hour. He also gave me some tips on keeping the downspouts clear. (See "" Description of Services Performed"" for details)"
5,See above - very professional & courteous!
5,David was extremely easy to work with. He returned my calls promptly. Estimate to completion of job was about two weeks. It was a relief to have someone call us back in a timely manner and complete the work. We are very pleased with the work he did for us. He is very honest and up front about cost and materials needed. He even took it upon himself to fix our slamming storm door on his way out. We've already requested him to repair a small crack in one of our exterior columns on the front porch. We will definitely use him again! Could not be happier!
5,David did a wonderful job. He arrived when he said he would and was even a day early in one case. He did the work even when we were at work. He is a really nice and dependable individual. We will definitely use him in the future!
5,"It went great. He went over the detailed list, identifying those jobs he could do; those he could not; and those he would handle differently. The jobs he could not do he recommended someone. and he provided a realistic, informative discussion of the materials needed which I purchased which saves the consumer a lot of money. He clearly has an eye toward saving consumer money and works diligently while he was here. The time he was running late, he called promptly. Very pleasant to work with. Will definitely use for all handymen type jobs. Highly recommend for all those jobs you have been putting off."
5,They have excellent service and they did good work. They are very good company to work with. I have had no problems whatsoever.
5,"He was very professional, showed up on time every morning and even came back out earlier the next day to make sure the job was completed before the painters got here.. Did a great job with out charging an arm and a leg and I will deffinatley be calling him again in the future.. I have saved his number in my phone. Bypass all other handymen and go straight for him, he is worth it and you wont regret it... I just hope he is available when i need him next time."
5,I hesitate to say how good he is for fear of him getting too busy! But he deserves the highest praise! He knows what he is doing and doesn't waste any time getting his jobs done. I'm making a list!
5,"Put together furniture, fixed light switch, put nails in brick..... they were quick and did exactly like i wanted"
5,Contacted David by email using the link on Angie's list. He got back with me within a couple of days and was able to do the work according to our schedule.
5,"We Can Do was very easy to work with. Very pleasant, punctual and easy to get in touch with. He quoted a very reasonable price for the work and actually charged less when it was done. Cleaned up work space. Finished work very quickly even though he had to come out 2 more times to finish sanding the drywall. Excellent work. You can't tell that there wherever 5 large holes in the wall. Will definitely call him again and recommend him to my friends and family."
5,"Main handyman arrived on time with his father-in-law who originally started the business and provided assistance as necessary. Both men were professional, capable, and very personable. They stayed on task, answered all questions, and were able to trouble-shoot problems as they arose. I feel confident that they would let me know if a job required another person with different skills than they have."
5,he does great work but best of all he explains every thing and the ways we might want something done and how much each way would cost so that we can choose. We will certainly have him do work for us in the near future. My husband would like a little lower cost.
5,I had a great experience using WeCanDo handyman service and would highly recommend it to others.
5,Great job.
5,"fine, did a good job"
5,Perfectly well
5,Guy was a perfectionist!
4,They don't level mobile homes
5,"Amazing people, Amazing Work!"
5,He was very detailed and did a great job. I have used before.
4,"gThey came out very promptly after I called, and did a professional and thorough job. They installed the closet rack, mounting the hooks more securely so it won't rip out of the drywall again. The same day they installed 2 bath lights and fixed the drywall around it. A few days later they came back and cut beveled wood boards to replace my old ones on my front porch posts. They primed and painted the boards also to match."
5,"Mr. Hammond proved to be a skilled, contentious, and reliable worker. He was pleasant to work with and maintained a tidy work site. Iwould not hesitate to use his services again."
1,I called them and they could not help me out until a week or so after.
5,"They came out and looked at the job. The guy who came out, said it will take 2-3 hours to complete the job. He gave me an estimate of around $35 an hour, which was less than what another guy charged me. He was pleasant. He talked about some other things. He gave me some advice on future jobs I was thinking about. When I called him, he said he would here the next day, and he was here the next day. He was on time."
5,He did it very quickly the day we requested the service. A quality job was done swiftly and we will definitely use this company's services again!
5,"We couldn't be more pleased. David was professional, kept us informed on schedule and had wonderful ideas. He completed everything on time and under budget and finished before Derby despite the April monsoons. He also managed to complete extensive plaster repairs and painting and kitchen cabinet painting and hardware replacement at our daughter's house during the same time period. We will definitely be using him again."
5,went great. Wil be using him again in the very near furture. painting this time
5,"Outstanding work. We had to cancel the first appointment due to weather, but he promptly rescheduled and arrived on time for the second appointment. My husband was home when the door was hung. My husband was pleased and that says a lot. We will use this company in the future."
5,"These guys did a great job! They were very quick to arrive and quote the job and the total installation did not take more than a few days to give the mud appropriate drying time. We noticed some small imperfections in a couple areas and they took care of it without issue, they also insulated the outer wall at no extra charge."
5,"Ordinarily I am too busy to ""report"" on service providers. But Mr. Hammond is a gem. Last job he did for me was to remove a lighting fixture, and install two in its place at opposite ends of a room, one of which was a fan. He had to got out and get some extra parts and crawl into my attic to get the job done. Great job. Done in a day. When Mr. Hammond did his first job for me, I offered to pay part of the job up front. He refused to take my money and told me right away that he never accepted any payment until he was sure his customer was completely satisfied. You can't go wrong hiring this man."
5,"Two other contractors were lined up to do the job, but were repeat ""no call, no shows"". I called ""We Can Do LLC"" and Mr. Hammond showed up at my door a few hours later, gave me a reasonable quote and started the job right there. My ceiling did not require a huge drywall job (like the other two led me to believe), but merely a plaster repair. He came everyday to apply coats of plaster and then sanded it down on the fourth day. It's a perfect job, I'm so pleased. It's rare to find a company that answers their own phone and keeps their promises these days, thanks ""We Can Do LLC""! I'll be a lifelong customer!"
5,They did a very good job. The job was done quickly by one worker and he completed the job within 2 hours. He did show up on time and cleaned up after he was done with the job. They came and started the project within two days of the time when I called them.
5,"I thought he was great. He came when he said he would. He did what he said he would do. We were very pleased with him. He called us back, a lot of times people in that industry don't do that. He showed up on time. He cleaned up all the mess. I was very happy with him."
5,Excellent service and work!
5,Great service.
5,Great.
5,see review.
5,Went great. Very thorough
5,A very good experience.
5,"Joshua was incredible! He did a perfect job and did it quickly! With Covid being a worry, I asked him to do the work in my garage which is not heated. I felt terrible about that but he was very agreeable and polite. I could not have asked for a better person to do the job. I would definitely hire him again. He gets a A+ from me!"
5,Wonderful. I would hire them again.
5,We are very pleased with this work. Repair of walls looks great. The pattern in the plaster was matched and painted. Joshua was on time and got right to work. He cleaned up after the job was complete.
5,"Joshua showed up on time and was ready to go with all the materials. He estimated it would take 2-3 hours, and it ended up taking about that time. He is professional with a great attitude and I would hire him again. This was a fairly small project which many won't do because it's not worth it, but Joshua understands one small project usually leads to more in the future. He has good business sense, and did a great job on this project."
5,"Had couple drywall repairs that he took care of for me. Very punctual, reasonable & did a Great Job!!"
5,"Josh and his nephew did a an outstanding job, very professional in his work. 5 +stars"
1,"first time the call did not go through. Next time, I left a message, no one ever called back"
5,"Joshua has been great. He has proven to be a tremendous help in preparing our house in the Highlands for our move this spring. So far he has installed a kitchen sink, water filtration system, garbage disposal, new lighting inside and outside, oak handrails and newel posts for the main stairs, a new 15' countertop in the laundry area, new front storm door, replaced a dimmer switch while re-anchoring a track lighting fixture and he has fortified the long closet rod in an upstairs closet. Joshua is prompt, efficient and extremely professional. As a sole proprietor of his business, his name goes on every project and he is very mindful of that fact. I will absolutely continue using Joshua's services and highly recommend him to anyone who needs a well-rounded handyman. Having gotten several quotes before beginning work, I determined Joshua's pricing to be very reasonable."
5,Very well. I was very impressed with his attitude and professionalism
5,"The first handyman I contacted through Angie's list did NOT get the job done because he had ""bigger irons in the fire,"" and I do not think he knew what he was doing. He kept bumping me off of his agenda over a period of three days. I would NEVER call him again The second one was considerate, gave me a reasonable price, fixed my two projects, and was prompt. Both jobs were done to my satisfaction as promised within an hour for a reasonable price. He had an assistant. This second handyman is one the husband of the childhood friend of my daughter. This second workman, who did a first-rate job, is a very capable and polite man that I would be glad to ask to do jobs for me in the future. His name is David Hammond."
5,Ceiling looks great and he did a great job! Will definitely hire again!
4,"The work was performed on schedule and correctly. However, the drywall finish wasn't great. The mesh was still showing when complete. Thankfully the drywall contractor I had come in afterwards fixed the work."
5,"I'm providing an A grade rating to this company because of their honesty. I loved that this company was transparent and did not commit just to get our business and then make us wait like so many others do. I spoke to Josh and he was honest at providing his availability. Even though we didn't to do business with him due to our immediate needs, we will certainly keep him in mind if ever needed."
5,It went well. The work was done quickly and the craftsmanship is good.
5,"Handyman was timely, professional and helpful."
5,"When we finally connected, he came over and did an excellent job!"
5,It went well. He was the lower of two bids for the above work.
5,He as always did a great job for a fair price. Highly recommended!
5,The work turned out excellent and I would hire again and/or recommend him to other people. The workman ship was excellent and complete.
5,"Joshua is very good at what he does! I LOVE my new bathroom. I had intended to just get needed repairs done in my bathroom, but Joshua suggested some tweaks that would update the entire room. He was willing to do whatever I wanted, but I went with his suggestions and could not be more thrilled!! And he stayed within my budget. Excellent work, professional, kept work space clean, responded quickly to any concerns, and price was very reasonable."
5,"Very good, extremely nice and did a great job of repairing walls and ceiling. Even went to Home Depot to get caulk to complete time I had paid for."
5,"Joshua was great. Arrived early, did the job needed, was very friendly and answered all my questions."
2,"After much back and forth as to time to do the work, a schedule was finally agreed upon. I took off work and waited and waited. . . finally I emailed him and his response was that he had not put my name in the time slot. Not a word yet about rescheduling or refunding coupon cost."
5,"Very well so smooth on dry wall, I only have to sand a little bit -very professional."
5,Joshua performed the work above and beyond my expectations. He explained what he was going to do and gave me great information for what to look for to determine if we have a larger issue than just old grout.
5,"Great! Prompt, courteous, excellent work."
4,"Punctual, very nice. I may have been expecting too much on the crack in my ceiling."
5,Josh came on time and did an excellent job. He explained everything he did and told me hints to try to prevent it from happening again. I will definitely use Josh again on future projects.
5,I am very pleased with the quality of work and would recommend this professional.
5,I was very impressed. We will be hiring him again.
5,"He began work as agreed and on-time. Was careful in repairing what could be repaired and what had to be replaced. Nice job ""distressing"" replacement wood to match original. Came in at the lower end of the quoted range."
5,Excellent! He even bought the new hinges.
5,"Sun porch is approximately 10 x 12. We supplied paint and primer. Joshua recommended a high-quality primer since we were painting an interior vinyl surface. He also supplied some extra primer. Joshua took extra care with caulking brad holes, taping baseboard and metal hardware, and any other imperfections. Nice job! Repaired a 90-year old ""Russwin"" door latch. Removed a bathroom door to completely rehab, which included removing and polishing all metal hardware. Very well done! Work done on-time and, as always, at a fair and reasonable price."
5,"He is excellent and very fast and neat. He does excellent work as well. In fact, I damaged someone elses house and I had him go and fix that too at a reasonable rate. I would highly recommend him."
5,"Josh did a great job. He arrived on time, worked fast, and did a great job. He is highly qualified and is a very nice guy, too. We have already asked him to do more work for us."
5,"While in the midst of a renovation, we ran into a problem requiring installation of a new ceiling electrical box. Joshua has done multiple jobs for us in the past so I called and asked if he could come the next day so we wouldn't have to delay our project. Joshua was gracious to come even though he had a full day's work scheduled. He's a gentleman and always does a good job."
2,"His caulking job was fine, good work. BUT: IT took him 3 1/2 hours to caulk 4 tubs??? He double charged me because he said the Angies List deal was only for one residence and I had him do two apartments. What's the difference: $75/hr for two hrs. of caulking in either kitchen or bathroom is what I bought. So I paid him additional $75 - culda got it done with Lowe's or Home Depot guys for $50. But: The guy knocked a tile off the wall, left it barely hanging. Going to have to have that fixed now, thanks to him. And then, somehow he pulled the handle on the handheld shower head, dropped it, and broke it. So, now because of him I have to go out and buy another showerhead extension and pay another handyman to put it on for me. So,,,,,no, don't think it went very well for me at all. Mr. Roark, however, made out like a bandit."
5,"If you are a perfectionist (or are married to a perfectionist like I am), Josh is your guy. He replaced four exterior doors and three screen doors in our circa 1964 house with new doors from Home Depot. They look great and fit perfectly. He is a great communicator, and does an outstanding job for a very reasonable price!"
2,"The drywall repair was okay, but wasn't smooth, and they suggested it was ready to be repainted, which is just silly. In the process of the ceiling drywall repairs, the moulding at the top of one of my cabinets was broken off, and repaired by haphazardly nailing it back in place (crooked) and bending the nails onto the wood (?!). I would have preferred that they admit they did not have the proper tools, and wait to do the repair. We contacted them to come back and repair it, which they did. It was done, but still not very well. it's obvious not flush with the rest of the cabinet, but it seems to be permanently warped or something. He showed up in a bad mood-- pretty much just coming in and leaving without saying anything, obviously upset that he had to come back. Even though the repair was mediocre, we were ready to be done with them."
4,It was alright. We were not able to come a convenient appointment until the March or so. He offered to come but we were unable to make our appointments work. He showed up when we agreed to and kind of cleaned up after himself. The price good. I don't think that he did as good a job on finishing it up especially with the spackle. I think that could have been done a little bit better.
5,Josh did a terrific job! He arrived in time was friendly and professional. Kept the area clean. Would definitely recommend Josh and would hire again.
5,Joshua provided the estimate on a prior visit and showed up the day he scheduled the repair even though it was raining all day. He completed the work in a day and agreed to add on some extra indoor repairs I requested. He and his coworker were professional and thoughtful.
5,It went fine. It was just the cost of the Deal. They were a little late but they called and let me know so it was fine. I would recommend them. They had a lot done in the 2 hours.
5,"At first we had some difficulty (punctuality, professionalism, thoroughness of the job) as we were working with a gentleman who was an employee for the owner, Joshua. For reasons unknown to me this employee no longer works for Joshua. After I began working directly with Joshua things got immediately better. He and his assistant were very professional, polite and flexible. They were eager to work with me to make things right and exceeded my expectations. I have since scheduled more work to be performed."
5,"Joshua ran a little late the morning of the appointment, but was good about informing me (I was off all day, so it wasn't any kind of problem). Quality work and looks good. The job was bigger than the 2-hours purchased through Angie's List, but he's coming back late this week to finish the job."
4,"The worker arrived on time the first day, and worked on caulking the shower/tub. I also asked him to return to repair some drywall in various areas of the house at an additional price. He was late the second time he came, and did not call to let me know. The caulking work was not acceptable, and I asked him to re-do it. Even the re-do was not acceptable to me. The drywall repair was good. The young man and his co-worker were pleasant, but I don't feel that the caulking work was professional quality. I wanted it to look better than if my husband had done it, and it didn't. Very disappointed, but at least it didn't cost very much."
3,New grout did not match the remaining old grout - the new was much darker. I declined the provider's offer of a re-do.
5,Joshua Roark came write on time. He promptly started working. I had a leak over the granite tile above the kitchen counter. The kitchen counter tile had lifted. Joshua carefully removed the tile without a scratch and placed it back in place He also fixed the drywall above the kitchen counter. My wife came home and was very pleased with the work performed. I would highly recommend him.
1,We received no reply form our inquiry to this provider.
5,"The handyman and his helper arrived on time, worked quickly and finished the task in the two-hour time-frame that I had already paid for. I was very pleased with the finished product, and with how knowledgeable this handyman was of historic properties. He shared some very good ideas with me about how to proceed with the bathroom renovation."
5,Came on time and completed job I less than 3 hours. My wife had been wanting this done but I just couldn't get around to it. Happy I called them. Excellent job
5,"Very professional, friendly, cost-efficient work. Would use again."
5,"Josh and Jamal were on time, extremely courteous and professional. They completed the work requested in a timely manner and cleaned the area accordingly. I would definitely recommend them and would hire them again."
5,Old caulk was removed (which was a challenge). New caulking was completed. It made a tremendous difference in the appearance in the areas that were done. Everyone was professional. I would definitely use them again!
5,Professional Handyman arrived on time and went right to work. I showed him some other projects I wanted done and he prepared an estimate. His rates are reasonable and his work is professional.
5,Josh was prompt and professional. He called ahead to let me know when he was coming. He was on time and completed the work exactly as promised and cleaned up the bathroom following the job. Great service.
5,It worked out really well. They did a very professional job and it was exactly what we needed. I rated it highly.
5,It worked out really well. There were no extra fees. They did a very professional job. It was exactly what we needed.
5,"Josh and his assistant were great! I was very impressed with him as he gave me a time to meet him at my house and he was actually there a minute early. He gave me a fair estimate and I accepted. He showed up at my house (again on time) and completed the work when he said he would and it looks great! My wife was hesitant about strangers being in our home when we weren't there, but Josh is very trustworthy and no need to worry if you can't be there while he is working. He does general handyman jobs and I will use him again should the need arise."
5,"Excellent. They arrived exactly on time, completed the work efficiently and well. I will definitely use them again."
5,"These guys were great. I had really only planned to have the shower caulk removed and recaulked and that would have been worth the $75 to me but they told me that wouldn't take 2 hours so we added 2 tubs caulking to the original job. Since they were here and I had another thing I needed fixed, I asked if fixing a pocket door would be something they would be able to do. Of course they could and they fixed it at a very reasonable cost. They were very punctual, polite, professional and I asked for their card as I plan to hire them again whenever I need a handyman. Highly recommend! Thanks Josh and Jamal!"
5,"Meticulous removal of old caulking with new razor blade for each room. Perfect new caulking, deep and neat. A true craftsman and artist with a caulking gun. A great value with so much accomplished for such a reasonable cost. I will never try caulking myself again."
5,Joshua arrived on time and went right to work. My husband and I were amazed at how quickly and expertly he performed the job. This is an older home and neither the floor or walls are level or square. Joshua efficiently made adjustments to make the cabinets and countertops work without additional expense to us. I had ideas that weren't the easiest to execute but Joshua completed the task without complaint and even politely suggested ways to improve on my ideas. He did a superb job installing a dishwasher where one didn't exist. He is a quality craftsman as well as a very fine person. He was extremely easy to work with and I will always use Joshua for repairs. His pricing is very reasonable when you consider how quickly he performs the work. We really appreciate his attention to detail and his commitment to pleasing his client. I've already scheduled Joshua for another job!
5,"Joshua is great! He looked over the work I needed done and quietly made great suggestions that saved me money. He was there working efficiently. Yes, there are times when he needs to pick up his sons because his wife is finishing school, but I was flexible and trusted him to let himself in and out of the house as needed. I was out of town and impressed that he had everything done so quickly and well. When he saw an area outside that he missed mortaring, he was back the next day and fixed it without me even knowing it. He's a hard worker, and he came up with some creative solutions for an area that was really hard to work with. Hire him! I'm going to write him write now and ask him to come do some other tasks. So wait a day or two, please, before contacting him."
4,"They arrived on time but did not have all their tools on the truck. Left to go back and get what was needed then realized that the ""snake"" had been broken on a previous job and not repaired. I marked down a little on professionalism because they should have checked all their tools and supplies before heading out for the day, The work they did was fine and I would use them again. I think the experience was a learning one for them on checking their equipment!"
5,"Joshua came with his partner John and completed the work they hung 22 pieces of art and 2 mirrors and moved three huge carpets and put three different carpets in their place. They were great as long has he's willing to do handyman services we'll use him and or his team. They completed the job taking care to hang art with wall mollies to ensure their safety all the while being very very professional I have just remodeled our home and have had electricians, plumbers and painters who would be wise to take a page from Joshua's book in professionalism. LOOK NO FURTHER you've found your next handyman...just call Joshua."
5,"also calked under my kitchen cabinets. Like I said, he has a good eye for detail. I would use him again."
5,Joshua and his helper quickly moved through my projects. They were very professional. I'm having them back to install screen door when it's delivered.
5,"They did a great job! There were no additional fees associated with the Big Deal, not even for materials. The guy who comes out is easily available and does what we ask him to do. He is professional at caulking bathrooms and his pricing is great on Angie's List."
5,"He was efficient, nice, attentive. He did what I asked and it was quality work"
5,"I was allowed to use the coupon that I had purchased from Angie's list, but due to the problem, the cost was higher. Both men were professional, courteous, and respectful. The job was explained as what needed to be done and its cost. Only wish that I had was that they had provided and installed a new tub drain mesh as well."
5,Everything turned out well. They showed on time and did the work as promised.
4,"It was good. He was a pleasant guy, did good work, and did a good job. He looked good and cleaned up. He took him about six hours and probably paid him an extra thirty dollars."
5,The drain cleaning ran into a hiccup with piping what was in poor condition. The gentleman took extra time and repaired the piping.
5,Joshua was very nice to work with. He arrived promptly and went right to work on cleaning grout around our two tubs. He applied caulking where needed. He also applied a layer of silicon seal to finish the project. We are very pleased with the finished project. He also did a nice job cleaning up when he was finished.
5,"We just wanted to hire someone who is dependable and is good at what they do. After looking at his reviews, we decided to hire him. When we contacted him, he was able to come out on a Saturday to provide an estimate. He ended up being able to complete the work on the same day. It turned out really good and it looked much better after he completed the work. We are going to be calling him to install the bathroom fan in the future."
4,Josh arrived exactly as scheduled and went right to work. He was a very pleasant young man and a pleasure to have in our home. He regrouted the shower and caulked where needed. He also caulked around the tub and vanities without being asked.
4,"he did a pretty good job, looked clean and fresh after he was finished"
4,"Service came out and previewed work requested and approved list. The work done was done well, except for the ceiling fan. Fan was out of balance and needed to be cleaned and balanced. He worked on the fan for a long time, 3 hours, and no fan remote will not work. Spent a lot to time trying to fix a problem that wasn't the issue. He didn't carry a lot of tools, and had to make trips to get them. He even requested that we pay for renting a taller ladder to facilitate the work. The eight hours work was scheduled over the course of a month, because of the limited time he was available, only week days from mid morning until 3 PM due to child care issues. I will say again, the work was good, just long and drawn out."
5,The service provided by Professional Handyman worked out fine. I got the job done. He was quick and communication was fine.
5,He was on time. He did his work. He was clean. He gave us a good estimate. There were no complaints about it. Everything was fine.
3,"Our kitchen sink is badly clogged and they tried to unclog it but broke a pipe. The sink is still clogged, but I think that's mostly because our plumbing system is badly designed, so there's more work to do no matter what. My landlord was not happy with the results but I thought the father and son who came and fixed it were very nice people. If anything I think their customer service was great."
5,"Joshua did an excellent job. In fact, Joshua also put in a back yard fence, re routed gutters, and cleaned brick mortar for me. Also, when there were problems with the air conditioning, Joshua went right over, checked out and repaired the problems. I have been so pleased with Joshua's vast knowledge in diagnosing and repairing the home maintenance problems I've had this year. I would use Joshua in the future and both recommend and endorse his work quality. Mary P"
5,"He was very fast, friendly and efficient. He also seemed quite knowledgeable about all types of projects."
4,"I have used this provider three times. The first time, Josh did the work himself and he did a beautiful job. The bathroom looked great and the clean-up was immaculate. The next two times he had a new worker in training. The quality of the work was not the same, and I had to cleanup the excess grout myself. I would use this company again if Josh was doing the work himsef."
3,"Part of the work was of pretty good quality and part not very satisfactory. Not very good on cleanup or do over where needed. If I needed tile work done again other than the very simplest thing, I would hire a tile specialist. This contractor in my opinion is not in that category. A Very nice person, but the work as a whole was somewhat disappointing."
3,"It was okay. It was supposed to be 8 hours worth of work. It was not a direct 8 hours of service; they are allowed to bring somebody and split the time up. I didn't see that part. He came and said someone else was coming. I just thought it was a friend and didn't know that it was on my dollar, which it was. He did 4 hours and the other guy did 4 hours. I probably wouldn't use them again."
5,"He responded quickly to my emails and showed up on time. He came out to take a look at the job and then came back on 2 different dates to finish the work. This was great because the coupon we bought just covered 4 hours of grouting and caulking and he actually needed some thin set for the tiles in addition to grout and caulk. We are very pleased with the work. Turns out he's a widely talented ""handyman"" so we'll be able to work with him again in the future on other odd jobs. He cleaned up after himself and only charged us extra for the special caulk he had to purchase to match our tile grout (which was a great attention to detail)."
5,The person who came out was very prompt and very efficient. The price was appropriate. I'd absolutely hire him again.
4,I was looking to replace the missing and damage wood siding on my chimney. They seemed knowledgeable and they were professional. But I decided to use a local company instead. I will not use them in the future.
5,The repairman fixed all broken grout and cleaned shower. He did not however have the sealant and asked me if I had already purchased it. I was not aware that I had to. Other than that he did a great job. Will probably use him again.
2,"The handyman from Professional Handyman was on crutches when he got here and he brought somebody with him to take up the slack and I had purchased 2 hours of professional handyman service and I wanted a ceiling fan to be hung and it required me making a scaffold in the room so that they could work. He told me that it would take longer than 2 hours to hang the fan and he said he would charge an extra USD 200 to get the fan up and that was estimating an extra couple hours. The fan got put up and the handyman wasn't here very much and he was gone to different places, but the guy who was helping him did most of the work. I really had questions as to whether it took as long as they did to hang the fan and I went ahead and paid the extra USD 200 and he said that he thought that it was more than that because he had 2 guys on the job and I told him that he was himself on crutches but he paid me by the man hour, so I ended up paying much more to get the job finished. I just wasn't happy, I don't think I good deal.He made the comment that he had 2 men on the job, but one man was not capable of doing anything. I told the guy to use his best conscience and let that be his guide. He offered to give me a USD 20 refund and I thought that was a slap in the face. They took so long to do it and I have hung fans in the ceilings and it doesn't take 4-5 hours to do it. It was a vaulted ceiling and he knew that before he got it, he should have passed the job over instead of doing that."
5,Joshua meant with me to get the floor loaded And bought back to the house and unloaded It as we'll.. Great guy!!
1,"I contacted the company via email with information about what work I needed done. I did not receive a all for two weeks. Once contacted I was informed the owner was in the hospital and that the caller worked with him and could assist in providing an estimate for the work I needed. The caller informed me they were busy since the owner was in the hospital but could come out the following week. I requested him to call me the next week to confirm his Saturday appt. he called Friday to let me know he could come that day but would be able to come Saturday. He never showed up, never called to cancel or reschedule."
3,"I called provider before scheduling the work to describe the job and make sure he was equipped and able to do what we needed. The job was described to the provider as cutting and installing tiles around the base of bathroom vanities. It would require cutting so the tile would fit around the corner base of each vanity. He said he would be able to do what was required and had experience so I scheduled the job. After arriving, I showed him the three vanities, the four corners of the vanities (two tiles on one vanity and one tile on each of the other two vanities) for which tile was to be cut and placed. He suggested just putting grout under the cabinet instead of tile because he thought no one would be able to see it. I repeated that we wanted the tile to be cut to fit around the cabinet base and that you could see underneath when sitting in the bathroom. When he finished three of the four tiles, he said he thought he was done. I checked and saw that he had left one area undone, so I gave him the tile and he started again. When he cut the tile, he said it didn't break where he wanted it to because it was brittle. He asked again if he could just grout under the cabinet. I called the owner and he affirmed that the tile was to be cut around the cabinet, rather than just a straight cut and grout. The tile was the only one we had, so it was too late to do an L cut that would fit around the cabinet, so he just cut another small piece from the scrap tile and installed it under the cabinet instead of just grout. I said, though not the best, it was better than just grout. I discovered then that the other 3 had been just grouted under the cabinets instead of cutting the tile as he had been told. But then his 4 hours were up and he had another job, so it was too late to do it right. He mentioned as he was leaving, that he usually only did ""repair work which didn't justify him having the saw for detail work."" I wish he'd told me that and been honest with me before we scheduled the job, and told me he couldn't do the required work. I feel the provider was not honest in representing what he could do, both before we scheduled and during the install. We are now stuck with the only tile we had being destroyed for any repair work we'd like to have done to remove, repair wall, cut and install tile like we requested. We were very unhappy and will not use again or give a good reference."
5,Project completed in a short time. No problems.
5,"Great! They completed the work in a timely manner. Grouting & caulking the entire tub area. They also recaulked around my sink. I would recommend this Co. to anyone who needs grouting, caulking, etc. They did an excellent job for a fair price."
5,Great! I'm very happy with the finished product!
5,"Worked very carefully - it took him a few days to complete the work, but it was beautiful when finished!"
5,Everything he does is good and he is a good finish carpenter.
5,He did a fantastic job.
5,JOB WENT WELL
5,Fantastic!
1,Handyman never returned my call !
1,No one ever even responded
5,Went great
3,Too expensive. $150.00 per sill.
5,Extremely well
1,They never called me back
5,"Josh arrived on time. Performed his duties in a very timely manner, cleaned up and was gone."
1,I called on 10/4/12 to arrange for roof repair. The guy stated he would be here at 7:30 am on 10/5/12. NEVER SHOWED . He called approximately 1 hour after his stated arrival time wanting to come in the sfternoon. I had already called someone else to do the repair due to rain forcast for afternoon.
1,"I don't think they were professional at all because they didn't write me anything out, that is what bothered me and when I questioned his prices and I ask him if he could please write me something out he went to the store and sent me pictures of the parts and prices. I thought that was ridicules and they he changed his prices. He said he way under quoted me but he still was pretty low so I was going to have him do the work and then he emailed me back and said he would not be able to do the work. He said he had way underbid me and he wouldn't be able to come to my house and give me a quote. I thought all of that was unprofessional. To me somebody should write you out an estimate that says this is what I am going to do and these are the prices. To tell somebody you are going to do the work and then the day before back out. I just would never recommend them. They were punctual but they were not professional. I was very shocked because I thought they were on Angie's List because they were very good and professional."
5,He was meticulous in his work and clean up. He will be back to perform other services for us.
5,"He arrived around 8:00 AM armed with all his tools and even a tarp to throw on the floor to contain the mess from the removal of old grout, soap scum and mildew from our shower. He worked steadily until the job was done about 3:00 PM. When he left the shower shined like a jewel so I was very pleased with trying my first service through Angie's List. He was extremely professional and caring about his work! I am going to keep his name and contact information in my iPhone so I can give his contact information to my friends and family."
5,He did great. He always tries to save me money without cutting corners.
5,"Fantastic value! Went above and beyond for our bathroom -- including removing our shower doors for extra thorough cleaning and remounting them after the job was done. Clean, polite, diligent and considerate. Well done."
5,Overall this job went off without a hitch. No major snags and he took care of the minor ones.
5,He showed up on time and completed his work quickly and professionally. He cleaned up after himself and asked me to approve the work before he left. I was very pleased with his work and would contact him again for handyman types of work.
5,"Arrived on time, friendly, and efficient."
5,"Did a great job. Came out as promised. Dug deep to remove all signs of mold. Replaced grout and came back a few days later to caulk because grout hadn't dried yet. I appreciated that he didn't just caulk and I'd never have known. I had paid him for 3 hours and he had some time left and offer to replace caulk and grout around my tube. Again, I that wasn't part of our deal but I sure appreciated it."
5,"We originally bought 4 hrs of tile, grout and caulk work from one of Angies list specials. However, when Joshua came to do the work it was discovered that we had extensive water damage behind one wall in the tub area. Found out there was water condensation doing the damage from improper installation of drywall from a previous job). He replaced the drywall with durock (a sheet of concrete) replaced tile, grout and caulk. He spent 4 days here making sure the job was done properly. There was a day he was unable to arrive as scheduled but called us to let us know of his delay and the delay wasn't that bad. We are very pleased with Joshua's work and are planning on using him in the future"
5,"Joshua was here when he said he would be, did the work in a professional manner; and when he finished prior to the four hour time frame to which we had committed, he offered to hang a towel rack which had fallen down in the area in which he was working. (It fell through no fault of his.) He did the job cleaning up any mess that was created as the result of doing so. I will definately have him back to provide some of the other services he list on his profile."
5,Excellent job.Our 50 year old floor looks like new. Very professional and at a very good price.
5,They arrived on time and did a good job.
5,Very prompt in coming for estimate and in doing work when contracted; quality of work appears to be satisfactory; and very low price compared to other estimates.
5,excellent work
4,That went fine.
5,Very professional
4,Short and sweet!
5,Fine
5,Perfect job. Very satisfied
5,He really did a good job.
1,Never showed up.
5,"Extremely well. We didn't realize the cabinets had to be assembled, but Nate forged on and completed the job even though it was bigger than we thought. He did a beautiful job, balancing their placement perfectly and taking the time to make adjustments to make sure they were even. I would call him again for any work I need done."
5,"It was perfect, the guy is great and unbelievable. I will be calling them again for another job."
5,"Nate was a true Professional. Highly recommend him. Punctual, respectful of home, and did a great job."
5,"Nate is a consummate professional, he did an exceptional job and clearly communicated the process for completing the requested work. We are thrilled with the results of Nate’s work and I highly recommend Nate. Nate exceeded our expectations, very timely, professional and he keep his work areas very clean and neat."
5,"Nate was exceptional from beginning to end. When I initially called him with a list of 4 'random' items I needed to have looked at (replace fence posts; replace a railroad tie that we have by our driveway; some siding repair & ceiling issues due to a previous leak), he responded within an hour. He came by later that evening on the way home just to look over the jobs and let me know what he would be able to do (everything except the ceiling). He got back to me with an estimate with 2 days and scheduled the work for approximately 3 weeks in advance. His schedule opened up and he came within a week. Even though he had not done siding repair before, it looked incredible! The fence posts were perfect - very sturdy, and he somehow replaced the railroad tie without having to remove the shrubs right next to it. He was extremely responsible, polite & the clean-up was immaculate. I definitely will use his services in the future and refer him to anyone needing Handyman services. There is a reason he has an 'A' rating."
5,"It went great. Nate communicates before project on his time, shows up at home as scheduled and gets right to work. Once arriving he worked continuously and moved from one project to the next. He is willing to tackle just about anything. His expertise level is superior."
5,He is very good. The work was beautiful I give him 5 Star.
5,Both jobs were well done and priced right. He is excellent.
5,Nate is the best! Always responsive and uses time very efficiently while doing a high quality job. Prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend!
5,"Nate is a good craftsman. He has varied skills that can be used in maintaining a house including minor electrical, fence /gate modifications, drywall repairs, painting, and mounting artwork. I've had to hire him to fix jobs other handymen have botched."
5,"I love my new shiplapped entryway! Nate has helped us with several smaller projects involving ceiling fan and lighting installation. When I reached out to him on a idea to shiplap the entryway, he was ready with solutions. From idea to execution took less than week. Nate is always responsive and reliable. His pricing is competitive and the quality of the work is top notch. We'll continue to seek Nate's help as we dream up new ways to customize our home!"
5,It was excellent! He was ahead of time and very professional.
5,"Excellent, reasonably price, knowledgeable."
5,"Wonderful. Nate responded to my Angie’sList inquiry within 24hrs. Based on my description of work needed, (install a chandelier at about the 18’ height) he gave me quote and projected a callback where we agreed upon the date. As everyone else has reviewed, Nate arrived on time; exercised care when maneuvering an extended ladder through my home; performed the work needed; and cleaned up behind himself beautifully. All I had to do was put my room back together. I have my new go-to person for Handyman needs! Thank you Nate."
5,"Great work once again by Nate. He is a very rare example of providing top notch quality of work and customer service/responsiveness. Not surprisingly, when I first contacted Nate he told me he was backed up a couple of weeks, yet he continually followed up with me until we found a mutually convenient time for him to do the job. I would hire him again in a heartbeat."
5,Nate arrived on time and completed our entire less in less time than I believed possible. The quality of his work is superb. He is the best handyman we have ever used. We would use his services again and we recommend him without reservation.
5,"It went great, the guy was fantastic."
5,Nate showed up on time. He did a very nice job and left the area as clean as if he was never there.. Highly recommended.
5,Nate was on time and got to work right away. He is very conscientious which built my trust in him. Nate did a couple of other small tasks that were not on my original list. He is a true professional and one I will hire again.
5,This is the second time we have utilized Nate's services during the last month. The first was in our current home which we are preparing to sell. We have utilized the services of several handymen during the last 25 years. Nate is not only the best in terms of his range of capabilities but also the best by far in the consistent quality of his work. We wish we had found Nate much earlier. He is straightforward and honest. He works hard and very intelligently. He is friendly. He has our strongest possible recommendation. Nate is the best!
5,"Everything went wonderfully well and it took a lot less time and cost less than I anticipated. Nate did everything from replacing seating straps on porch furniture to replacing screen panels on our screened porch to changing front door hardware to replacing toilet seats to replacing screened porch light fixtures to taking down a wall mounted TV (and the mounting device) to moving furniture, to replacing all door stops, to setting a hinge pins on doors to running an errand to Lowe's, etc, etc. His attitude was great. We would happily utilize his services again."
5,It went well. Nate is always a professional.
5,"By far, one the best I've ever had to my house. First of all, Nate communicates prior to visit and is always prompt with responses. Checks in day before to confirm and arrived on time the next day. As for his work, Nate arrives and gets right to business. Updates me during job and asks me to check out each task as completed. Understands cost-effectiveness for jobs being performed and provides good advice. His skill set is large and he will be my first call next time I need help. I had mostly small tasks but won't hesitate to call on bigger items next time."
5,"Nate is an outstanding service provider. He is a careful and competent professional and his prices are very reasonable. I call him when I have a ""handyman"" job and I highly recommend him to others."
5,"Great! Nate is our ""go-to"" handyman, and as always, he did topnotch work, promptly, professionally, and at a great price. Our bathroom looks terrific."
5,"Nate was very responsive to my inquiry and in providing an estimate. He was able to fit me in earlier than expected and arrived when he said he would. Nate was professional, courteous and did an excellent job. I will definitely reach out to him in the future!"
5,"Excellent. He is really a nice guy. Everything was perfect, he was really good."
5,"Nate was courteous, clean, on time, and knew his stuff. He was in and out in no time. He's definitely worth hiring."
5,"Nate arrived on time and ready to work. We just moved into a new house and had several small jobs to be done, like hang curtain rods, tv wall mounts, remote garage door opener. Nate has also worked for us at our previous house in Charlotte and always does a nice neat job. Will certainly hire again. Need to book in advance"
5,"Did great work. Very responsive to phone calls. Prompt and punctual for appointment, even though it was scheduled on the day of the biggest snowfall of the year."
5,"Wow!!! It's been a long time since we have had someone the caliber of Nate come to do work on our home. He returned our phone call almost immediately...arrived exactly on time...got to work immediately...was thoughtful, professional and kept us in the loop the entire time. And the end result? PERFECT deck steps!!!! He was faced with a problem, quickly analyzed the situation and resolved it and now we have a beautifully fixed deck with some very sturdy amazing steps!! So grateful for Nate's work ethic and skills as a craftsman...like I said, it's been a long time since my husband and I hired a handyman that actually did what he said he was going to do and then went above and beyond to do an excellent job!!! Thank you, Nate - we highly recommend you!!!"
5,"The service was excellent, they were punctual, fair priced and good quality of work."
5,Nate was very responsive...he was able to visit my home and provide an estimate in a very prompt manner. Nate finished the job on time. He did an excellent replacing ceiling sheetrock and painting. Nate left the place spotless. Overall a great experience and I highly recommend him!
5,"Nate was able to fix a number of items around our home, to my wife's delight. He was professional, courteous and reasonably priced. I would recommend Nate to anyone who asked if I ""knew a guy who could fix..."""
5,"Great! Nate is knowledgeable, professional, prompt, and very accommodating. I can always count on him for topnotch service! Work above was performed over two visits."
5,"It was a pleasure having Nate work in my home. He was courteous, punctual, professional, and kept me apprised of his work as he went along - what he had completed, and what he planned to complete the next day. The quality of his work was excellent, and I would not hesitate to recommend him to anybody."
5,"On time, accommodating, friendly, professional, quality service"
5,Responded promptly but told he was not available for few weeks.
5,"Nate fixed some holes and rot on my siding. he was on time, quick, friendly and did a fantastic job! can't even tell there were holes/rot to start with, perfect match. coming out next week to fix/replace my fence and gate and know he'll do a great job. now i just have to make a list of everything on my to do list cause this is the guy i'm going to call. I highly recommend Nate"
5,"Nate is very professional. I wish all service providers were like him. Because Nate lives clear on the other side of the city from me, I took pictures of the projects that needed to be done in order to receive an estimate. Nate got back to me almost immediately with an estimate. After deciding to hire Nate, the job was scheduled with the first day of work to start at 8:30 AM Nate arrived on time and got to work right away and worked through the day only taking breaks to pick up needed supplies and for lunch. The 2nd day of the project was the same. Nate does quality work and doesn't take short cuts. Prior to contacting Nate, I had contacted several others about doing the job. Most of the bids were for less work (such as putting the new vinyl flooring over the top of the old vinyl flooring instead of removing the old flooring first, which is what I wanted) but at a significantly higher cost. For future projects, I will definitely be contacting Nate."
5,"Great. He was professional, timely, did quality work."
5,"Went great. Nate was extremely responsive to my initial call, and he was able to come to my house later that day. He was prompt, professional and did the job exactly as I had hoped. Would definitely call him for other projects."
5,We have used Nate for multiple services now and he has always been great to work with. Very professional and does a very good job. We will continue to use him on future projects and have referred him to friends and family.
5,"Great! I am hiring him again for a double ceiling fan install. He was professional, courteous, punctual, and exceeded all of my expectations."
5,"I wrote a review at the time but I don't see it and I was so impressed with Nate that I am doing it again. Back in the spring we had Nate come and do a couple of hours worth of small tasks and repairs, and then had him come back and pressure wash and stain the deck. He is professional, efficient, timely and goes the extra step. I am so happy to have found him and will definitely use him again."
5,"Very well. Nate called and scheduled the appointment. Arrived on time and gave an approximate time to do the work -- and he finished 45 minutes ahead of estimated time. Very polite, professional, and efficient. He also cleaned up his work area.Would definitely recommend AND hire again."
5,Surperb. He found another rotten piece of wood on the railing that we were unaware of and replaced it without increasing the price of labor. He also replace a piece of weather stripping on the door that he noticed should be replaced.
5,Wonderfully! Called ahead to confirm date/time; very pleasant and efficient...cleaned up too!
5,"Nate was early (which is awesome and something that rarely happens). He was professional and cleaned up after he was finished (also something we haven't seen very often when we've had people do work in our home). There was an issue with the first electrical box being very difficult to remove so it took more time than he planned, so he worked on the first light, left to take care of another customer, then came back to finish the second. He had to replace the existing electrical boxes with the reinforced boxes which we anticipated, so we purchased them along with the fans ahead of time. There was an additional fee of $50 per each fan for Nate to replace the electrical box with the reinforced ones which he let me know ahead of time. If it was a 1:1 swap, there would've been no additional charge."
5,Everything went well. I plan to hire him again to install two lights once the come in.
5,great! very respectful-wonderful experience--professional
5,He Did great work . Will hire again.
5,"Provided an estimate within a day or two, and had availability to execute the work within a few days of my request. He purchased materials and completed the work in one single day. The hand rails that Nate built are much more sturdy than those which were replaced. Nate worked quickly and efficiently. He cleaned up nicely, and was conscientious about providing a ""product"" that met my expectations."
5,Nate called the evening before to confirm the time and showed up on time. He worked the whole and did a great job.
5,I can see why Nate has Service Awards - he is extremely professional and a very nice person. He did a great job installing all 4 of my ceiling fans (2 which were vaulted ceilings) and took the time to ensure that the height was satisfactory. I have a couple of jobs in the near future and he is now added to my phone contacts as the person to call for all of my additional work. The cost was $325.00 which is very reasonable for the job done. Thank you Nate.
5,"Nate was punctual, professional, and worked very quickly. He is definitely someone I would call on again"
5,"On time, very thorough - highly recommend"
5,"Wonderful person to work with. Professional, courteous and reasonable."
5,Nate showed up on time and did great work. I would definitively use him again in the future.
5,"No doubt about it, Nate did more than I had expected and very efficiently. His work attitude is an A+ and he will be on my list for future jobs. His fee is more than fair and he has good communication skills which means alot."
5,"It went great. I loved that I did not have to follow him around to make sure he was staying busy and that he NOTICED stuff. (He was the one who noticed the exterior flood light was broken, and the one that offered to replace the porch light cover.) I initially hired him because he was the only handyman I contacted who could make it out in less than a week and I was concerned about the water. I'll hire him again because he does great work and works quickly."
5,Nate did an excellent job installing the ceiling fan and even came back when the fans didn't work right the first time. Great job
5,Nate was resourceful in providing suggestions on how to seal the concrete gaps on the drive way and patio. He was able to make a quick trip to the local home depot to get the necessary materials and get the job done promptly. Would hire again!
5,"Did a great job, was very careful not to cause any damage to the parts of the door not affected by the install. Cleaned up afterwards and did not leave until I was totally satisfied that the installation was to my satisfaction"
5,Great! Nate was on time and did a great job. Very efficient.
5,"Nate was very professional, completed my to do list quickly and clean. He ask the right questions on hanging my shelf and pictures. They look really good. I appreciate him providing a service to get this type of jobs done. Upon first calling Nate he confirmed an appointment also followed up the day before to make sure everything was on point. I will request his handyman service again. He charged a fair price."
5,"Nate was very professional, on time and very good at his work. I love my ceiling fans. Nate will be the one I call if I ever need electric work done again."
5,Nate is always dependable and does very fine work
5,"Nate is a really nice guy. Job well done, neat and clean. Very respectable friendly person. I would use his services again."
5,"Great! Nate was willing to work me in on short notice. He did a great job, and the price was very fair. I appreciate Nate!"
5,"Nate arrived as promised, finished the work in a timely manner and did a great job. He is friendly and personable. We will use him again and in fact he is coming back in a few weeks to powerwash and stain the deck. Highly recommend."
5,"Went well. He works hard, takes his time and gets the job done. He went above and beyond a simple installation with one of the fans by having to go into the attic because the electrical box was loose and needed some tweaking. It took him longer to install this one particular fan because of that. We appreciated his professionalism. I've used him before and will use him again. Thx, Nate!"
5,went very well. he's a great guy and knows what he's doing. he called and followed up and came back a second time.
5,"Great. Nate is a great communicator, was on time, let us know what he'd need to charge project-by-project, and did great quality work. We recommend him highly."
5,I emailed Nate with the list and he called me back very quickly. I explained what was expected because the house was vacant and we lived in another state. He gave me a very reasonable quote and scheduled to come and do the work and I sent him a more detailed list with pictures. On the day of the work he called to let me know he had arrived and had looked at the work to be done and was ready to go buy supplies. He checked to make sure there were no changes. He spent about 8 hours doing a list of about 21 things including digging out two posts and cementing two new ones on the backyard gate. He took pictures of his work and called me when he had questions. I highly recommend Nate for his professionalism and commitment to detail. The work done was great!
5,Nate did a superb job and was very professional and trustworthy. Price was very fair and quality was great. I would definitely use him again.
5,"He was very efficient and quick. Nice, personable, friendly, and professional."
5,"Nate was right on time and performed the work exceptionally well, and I was very satisfied. Even though his calendar was booked, he made time and came to my house first thing in the morning to install the new microwave. I would not hesitate to call Nate again for any additional work that may arise."
5,"I used Nate in the past for exterior light installation. The cost and work were excellent, so I decided to use him again. Nate did an excellent job this time as well. We had 9 lights installed throughout our home. A lot of the lights had intricate details and strands, which were time consuming to install. Nate assembled and installed everything with ease. I highly recommend him. I will definitely use him again for future projects. Thanks Nate!"
5,He was great! We were moving from one house and bought another house. He came in and did the whole punch list thing for me and I was very impressed.
5,"Did a great job. Had to install an anchor on one, and had to re-work the wiring on one of the light kits. He stuck with it and got it done. Appreciated the effort and would hire again,"
5,"I was blown away at how nice and helpful this guy was-hired him for a small job putting in a door jam but he changed out my smoke detector batteries, all the bulbs on my bedroom light fixture and even hung some of my Christmas lights on my outside bushes so I could use up my minimum time. Loved it-definitely recommend him!"
5,"Excellent work. Nate came out to see what needed doing, gave me a price (not including faucet which I purchased) and came back the next day with his assistant to complete the work."
5,He was prompt and professional. I would highly recommend
5,Nate arrived on time and did the job very quickly. We have about 300' of 6' tall fencing installed 6 months ago that needed weather proof staining front and back. Some areas of the fence panels were coming off the post so Nate fix those areas too. Nate purchased the materials needed and showed us the receipts. There was leftover stain that he left for us to use later on. He is very professional and trustworthy. We will defiantly hire him again.
5,"Nate did a great job , he was on time and the job didnt take long. I would highly recommend him to others. A few months later and I noticed one of the fan blades is a different shade but it hasnt bothered me enough to flip it around."
5,This was an excellent Angies's deal. What I needed done was done at an excellent price with an excellent handyman.
5,"Everything went smoothly. Nate's professionalism is evident in all he does. He responded to all my requests promptly, did the work perfectly, and the cost was more than fair. I highly recommend Nate and will definitely contact him again in the future when the need arises."
5,Nate has done several projects around my house over the past two years and has always done excellent work in a timely fashion at very reasonable prices. Very professional and is always my first call and will continue to be my first call for any handyman work.
5,Very well. Quick and we'll done job
5,Excellent. Was in and out in no time. Everything working fine !
5,"Everything went great! Nate arrived well on schedule, was incredibly friendly, personable and professional. We walked the property and he was open and direct regarding the work he felt needed to be done and wanted to ensure that I was in agreement and that it was the scope of work I had requested. I left him to his work feeling confident that this was a hard working guy with integrity, and he certainly is. I highly recommend him and will certainly hire him again in the future!"
5,This was the second time we have worked with Nate. I texted him and he was at our home within a day to give us an estimate. We had a color already picked out but he suggested a lighter shade and I'm so glad he did. The room looks great. Nate is very professional and so easy to talk with. We will definitely work with him again.
5,"It was great, Nate was able to fit me in the same day I requested service and was fast and clean. I was very happy with the service provided."
5,"Nate did a great job. He got the appointment set up quickly, confirmed it and showed up on time. Work was done quickly and flawlessly. Looking forward to using him on other projects."
5,"Excellent! Nate has provided handyman services before, and I highly recommend him. He is very thorough and does a great job."
5,"This is the second time I've hired Nate to do some work for us. He is always punctual, fair priced and does good work. Would not hesitate to use him again."
5,"I had several small things that I needed to have done. Based on reading the reviews, Nate was my first choice. I definitely was not disappointed! He was on time, professional, and courteous. He takes pride in his work and it definitely shows.I was very pleased with the work performed and should the need arise, I will definitely call on him again."
5,"He has a $100 minimum and it was certainly worth it. These had been installed incorrectly and he had to fix them both. He is very professional, knows what he is doing, is punctual and responsive."
5,"Nate was a very professional guy, and he had an awesome work ethic! He was driven to do the job and to do the job well from beginning to end. He responded quickly to my request for a quote, followed-up, asked questions if he needed me to make a decision during work-in-process, and he kept his word. Nate was a pleasure to work with, and I would definitely recommend him and ask him back. Nate was very conscientious. It amazes me that people have these types of skills because I have none of them at all! It is such a relief to have this work done and done well."
5,Nate was really great to work with. He picked up when I called him the first time and set expectations on when he could perform the work. He was able to perform the work sooner than he originally thought. He communicated well and was organized. He did the job well. I would definitely hire him again and recommend him.
5,Nate was very professional. He worked me in quickly. I plan on hiring him again for future projects
5,"Nate installed a kitchen light fixture, dimmer switch and a bathroom fan/light. Both were difficult to install but especially the bathroom light and fan combo. The fan was very difficult to install because of its location and the difficulty of extracting the old fan. He did an excellent job and I would hire him again and highly recommend him to anyone. He is very nice and easy to work with. Definitely hire him!"
5,"Nate was punctual, courteous, professional, friendly and tidy. We have him scheduled to replace four additional fixtures next week. Could not recommend more highly."
5,"Used the 'Deal' offer and Nate was very responsive as soon as I completed the purchase. He worked me into a very busy schedule, was prompt and very efficient in completely the job. Would definitely recommend and will use him again if need arises. Very happy with price and service provided!"
5,"Used the 'Deal' offer and Nate was very responsive as soon as I completed the purchase. He worked me into a very busy schedule, was prompt and very efficient in completely the job. Would definitely recommend and will use him again if need arises. Very happy with price and service provided!"
5,"Used the 'Deal' offer and Nate was very responsive as soon as I completed the purchase. He worked me into a very busy schedule, was prompt and very efficient in completely the job. Would definitely recommend and will use him again if need arises. Very happy with price and service provided!"
5,"I've used Nate before to hang some fans in the house for me. Always punctual and very pleasant guy and he's priced fairly. Works by himself so he takes his time and is meticulous about the work. Working in the attic was a real pain in the butt. He spent the better part of 3 hours completing the job. He had to wrestle the rotted board out from approx 20 ft up outside, then had to brave the attic heat to finish the job inside. I didn't have a subfloor in attic so we put some boards down for him to place his ladder on to reach the inside attic vent, very tricky business for Nate. He was a real trooper about sticking with the project and seeing it to the end. Fence posts and trim look great. He sanded/ painted and wood filled low seams on trim. He cleans up after himself too. Price included digging and replacing 2 fence posts as well, but I have Poison Ivy in the area so we scrubbed that project. I stuck with price because he worked very hard in hot/ compromising conditions. He is a good handyman."
5,Excellent job install ceiling fan. Very professional and courteous.
5,"He was on time, completed work for quoted price and his work is top notch."
3,"Fan installation was done, but lights in some rooms in my house was not working later! Found the actual problem hard way after 2 days. He did not insulate the wires inside the box which caused the electric arc issue causing short on a circuit in my home. I had to get a licensed electrician an pay $200 to diagnose and fix this problem!! :("
5,couldn't have been easier. Nate knows what he is doing and does a great job
5,"Nate is a very competent workman and very pleasant to be around. He had planned to be at our home for a half day, but stayed all day as we kept adding new tasks to his list. He was very pleasant and patiently keep running to Lowe's/Home Depot to get new parts and supplies as we kept adding to his tasks. This guy is one-in-a million! The above price does not include the substantial bonus we added to Nate's bill to express our gratitude."
5,Nate was very efficient. We will definitely use his services again.
5,"Nate did a great job. Quick, professional and all around nice guy. I hired him to paint my deck and he did a great job with that too."
5,"Great service from Nate. I saw his special on AL and while it didn't match what I needed, I figured it was close enough for me to call him and see if he could do the work. We have switched furniture in a couple of rooms and now the fans did not match the furniture. We wanted Nate to switch the fans for us. He was very responsive on the phone and very helpful in scheduling an appointment quickly. He showed up on time and was done in less than an hour. The $99 is his minimum charge. Excellent service and work and highly recommended."
5,Great - will use again for other work
5,Nate was fantastic. Very helpful and actually performed more services than originally agreed upon as we realized the task was more involved. Would definitely hire Nate for any household improvement needs.
5,Nate was able to replace one and then he had to come back since I was not able to install the second one. He was very helpful and will be using him again.
5,"Nate communicated with me promptly after service was purchased, setup time and arrived as discussed. Once on premises, job was completed fast, efficiently and with good quality. I can highly recommend Nate."
5,Nate was great! He worked so hard and did a great job. He was very fast and cleaned up after himself. We will definitely use him again.
5,"He was very fast, efficient, and pleasant. He came the same day I contacted him which was fabulous."
5,Very professional and considerate. One of the best and will use him for all home repairs. I highly recommend Nate.
5,"I highly recommend Nate. He confirmed his appointment, arrived promptly and worked tirelessly. There were some issues with the items I gave him to install and he worked around them, bought the additional parts necessary to complete the job and performed additional electrical work that was required. Nate routinely gets excellent reviews and if you use him you will see why. He is accommodating, friendly and neat. He doesn't take shortcuts and seems to do every job as if it was his own house."
5,"All went well. Arrived on time, work done efficiently and cleaned up afterwards. Nate was very professional and was able to look at a few other jobs I was considering while he was there."
5,Nate was professional and efficient.
5,Nate did a great job - very professional and efficient.
5,Excellent handyman. Was very prompt and responsive prior to the appointment. Showed up on time and was friendly and professional. Handled both jobs I needed with ease. Results were great. Would use again.
5,Went well. He was pleasant and provided good quality work. Plus he went a step further and corrected poor installation of old fan.
5,Nate was easy to schedule the service with. He arrived right on time and was very professional. I had purchased an Angie's List deal but needed an additional light fixture installed that was not part of the deal so he gave me a very fair price and completed all of the work. I am happy with the results and would use him again.
5,"Last part of the kitchen remodel. The old backsplash had been taken out some time back while we were doing the countertops. Took time to find the right backsplash material and when finally installed, there were a few places where new drywall was needed. Nate came (on time) the first day, scoped the job, went to get materials, and came back to begin work. Was a two day job, to allow drywall mud to set, then sand, etc. Painted it after that and bam -- done."
5,Service was prompt and friendly. Will definitely call again and recommend to friends.
5,Nate did an excellent Job! He is very nice and courteous and he went above and beyond what was necessary to get the paint job done. He also did an excellent job cleaning up afterwards! I will absolutely use him again in the future!
5,Nate was very professional and did an awesome job. He was on time and before I knew it he was finished. I would highly recommend Nate and will definitely send business his way.
5,"Midway through the initial install (3 fans removed and 2 replaced) I realized the replacements I ordered were too small. Nate was understanding, accommodating, and indicated he was fine foregoing payment until he returned to install the correct sized fans. I offered to pay him twice for the fans that were switched twice, but even if I hadn't I don't think he would have been offended. At the end of the day, you want a competent, conscientious and trustworthy guy in your house and Nate is just that. Don't pay an electrician for fan/lighting work. I've completed several fan installs myself, but now I'd rather leave it to a pro, and Nate is just that. We will have him back again!"
5,"I joined Angie's List to find a competent and reliable Handyman. I spent a good amount of time reviewing the ones that had A ratings. Even though there were quite a few I felt best about the reviews for Updates by Nate. I decided to try one of the deals that he offered to replace 2 light fixtures. I thought it would be a good opportunity to see how things went. Nate arrived on time, he was both friendly and professional and he made sure I was happy with everything he did. Since the first experience went well I had him come back out to do some additional items. One of the things that I liked best is that Nate did all of the work himself so I did not have multiple people for different tasks. He is also very neat and he cleaned up everything before he left. I will definitely use him for additional projects in the future."
5,I would highly recommend Nate. We purchased a deal on Angie's List and Nate contacted me immediately. He scheduled the install the following day and did a great job.
5,"Nate was very professional and completed the work in a timely manner. He cleaned up after the job and you would never have know he was there. I was impressed as he had only had foot surgery about 2 weeks before coming out to install our fans. He worked around our bed, which one of the fans hangs over, so we would not have to take it apart and move it. I was very impressed with his service and professionalism."
5,"Nate is a skilled and friendly professional. Work was scheduled promptly, completed quickly and to perfection. Could not be happier with the end result. Highly recommended."
5,"Nate emailed within 24 hours to schedule. He came by the next day for estimate, and said that he could go ahead and do the work that day! I was thrilled! He was in and out in about an hour and a half. My bathrooms look great, ready for holiday guests."
5,Great! The provider was extremely responsive (we had several email exchanges while I was purchasing the lights). His communication was prompt. He arrived on time and cleaned up afterwards! I would definitely recommend Nate Handyman Services and will definitely use him again for a number of house projects.
5,Called before service arrived on time. Very quick and professional. Will definitely hire again.
5,Nate was fantastic and I will definately use his service again in the future.
5,Nate was great. Pinged me to let me know traffic was bad and he'd be a few minutes late. He fit me in his schedule as I was off all week. Work was very good and he pointed out several issues that I needed a plumber and a qualified electrician to take care of. I will definitely use Nate again. I plan on having him come out to do outside repairs if the weather co-operates.
5,"Nate has helped us out with a couple of projects in our fixer-upper. Recently he helped install some large cabinets in our kitchen. What should have been an simple job turned into a full morning due to our uneven flooring. He refused to leave the job undone, and was actually more of a perfectionist than I am. Nate is always pleasant, easy to reach and goes out of his way to make sure we're satisfied with the end product. We'll definitely be calling him again as we continue to work on our ""to-do"" list"
5,Nate was very responsive. He came out and looked at our deck before making recommendation of how to treat. Additionally he helped us select the product to be applied. We bought the restore product and had it ready for him. Nate came out a day early to remove the deck furniture and pressure wash. Next day he was back early and worked all day applying the product. Deck is 20x12 with 3 steps to the yard and rails on 2 sides. Excellent job. We are very pleased and highly recommend Nate's services.
5,Nate did a great job of taking down the old ceiling fans and replacing them with new ones. Would definitely use again.
5,Nate did a great job. He was professional and meticulous. Even cleaned the new fixtures to remove dust and hand prints. Will definitely contact him for future needs.
5,"The job went well. Nate was punctual, professional and did a quality job."
5,"I purchased the Angie's List deal to have ceiling fans installed and it took Nate a few days to get back to me because he was out of town. However, once he returned, he phoned to schedule a time to come out. I was delayed and once I was ready, scheduling was easy and he was on time. He was quick and quiet (I have newborns who were napping). His work was great."
5,Nate called me back immediately and quickly came to the rescue to help get our house ready to sell. His attention to detail and quality of work was impeccable. This is the second time I used Nate and I highly recommend his services.
5,Nate showed up on time. He constructed the ceiling fan quickly and installed. The ceiling fan he removed to be replaced with the new one was installed in a different location. He brought all equipment and tools needed. he was polite and efficient. he was there probably only an hour.
5,"This is the 2nd time we've hired Nate to do work for us, and it went great. He was willing to work on a Saturday morning, which really helped us out. He showed up on time, and worked quickly. He also put together another set of shelves that I was planning to finish, but didn't. After he left I noticed that the shelves were not secure to the drawers. I called him and he came back and secured them right away. We are very happy with our new office furniture!!"
5,"He arrived on time and he was done in less 90 minutes, very impressed, will hire him again, his reviews speak for themselves."
5,"Nate did an excellent job. Was prompt, courteous and cleaned up debris from the install. I would highly recommend his services."
5,"Great service. Nate was clean, efficient and knew what he was doing. He did a great job!"
5,"Prompt, professional, good work - he came to do the work when promised, cleaned up after, and worked efficiently. Will call him again for my next projects."
5,Went great. He was professional did the job clean and quickly. all around good guy. I would for sure use him in future projects.
5,He worked fast and did a great job.
5,"I had had Nate install some ceiling fans previously. As with the first experience, he was responsive in scheduling and the finished work was exactly as expected/needed."
5,"Nate did a great job, he was prompt and was easy to work with!"
5,"Nate was very responsive, timely, a great communicator and a pleasure to work with. Seems very competent for basic handyman work."
5,"Nate did a excellent job for me. This is my second time using his company for odd jobs. He is fast, professional, and takes pride in doing the job right the first time."
5,EXCELLENT!!! Showed up on time and installed the fans without any delays.
4,"It was good. He was very nice and very professional. He came, did the work and put his ladder back and everything was on a professional scale. When he couldn't make it he did call back and tell us exactly when he would be here."
5,"Nate installed 5 fans for me. No problems. He was responsive to my emails, showed up on time, and provided the service without any issues. I purchased the 2 fans for $99, and got the other ones installed at approx $75 each. One of my fans was apparently missing a piece and Nate was kind enough to go to Lowes during his install to pick up a replacement. Nice customer service, I'd use him again. Thx, Nate!"
5,"Very professional, prompt and patient. Works very fast but his quality of work can't be beat. I recently moved and needed some handyman work done so I reached out to Nate and he responded almost immediately. I will definitely hire again and will be sure to share his information with friends."
5,"Nate was prompt, professional, and got the job done! I would definitely call him for other handyman jobs."
4,"Nate did a very good job. I purchased the installation special through Angie's List. He showed up on time. He went above and beyond the special as I was not aware it did not include chandelier installation. My chandelier has at least 100 decorative ornaments that had to be hung on it. A very time consuming project. But with the help of my boyfriend, Nate completed that and another regular fixture in about an hour. The installation instructions of the chandelier said it would take a minimum of 2 hours. My chandelier looks great and it changed the look of the room. He agreed. I wanted to get a quote from him to install more fixtures in my house where there are currently none. But he informed me that since he is not a licensed electrician he could not install fixtures where they aren't previously preinstalled. If he was, I would definitely use him again"
5,"I called Nate at 8.15am on a Monday morning. He called me straight back and had taken a cancellation for the same morning. He arrived at the house atapproximately 9.45 am. He was polite, courteous and very professional. The job was taken care of and finished by 10.15 am. I would definetely use Nate again."
5,Nate was able to schedule my work today because of a cancellation. He arrived on time and efficiently installed the ceiling fan in a 10 ft ceiling. Took about 40 minutes and we were very pleased with the work. He was courteous & friendly. Will definately use him again.
5,Showed up promptly and went to work. completed job and area was very clean. he had time to replace two GFI outlets that had burned out. Excellent experience.
5,Very good experience! this is our 2nd time hiring a handyman to install ceiling fans. It took the first guy approx. 4 hrs to install two. It took Nate approx. 1 hr to install two ceiling fans. GREAT JOB!
5,Perfect - could not have been better or easier!
5,"On time, good work. This is the 2nd time I've used Nate's services. The price was for two installs, but I had just one."
5,"Great job. Very professional and friendly. As requested, he gave me a heads up when he was on his way so I could be prepared. He was very fast and clearly knowledgeable about the job at hand."
5,Nate was responsive for scheduling and arrived in the timeframe scheduled. He was pleasant and professional. I also plan to have him complete a few other projects at some point based on our conversation.
5,"Nate was great. His cost was very affordable at $75 a fixture, and he was running a special on top of that of 2 fixtures for $99. He was friendly (even showed me a picture of his new pup, Ranger, after meeting our dogs) and very professional. He was able to work with a beautiful, yet pain in the butt, light fixture that I had bought for our dining room, and even had me come take a look before he screwed it in to make sure it was exactly where I wanted it. While he was there, I inquired about the cost to replace our foyer pendant light, and not only was it the same price (despite the height) but he offered to do it that same day and come back after his next job. Other service providers on Angie's List had quoted me between $220 and $300 due to the height of the ceiling, but he said as long as his ladder could reach, it was no extra charge. Also, we had a wiring issue with the light over our kitchen island. Whenever we turned on the light, the back porch light also came on, so we couldn't have one on without the other. Even though we didn't ask him to fix this, we noticed after he left that these lights are now functioning correctly and each operate by separate light switches! He must have corrected the issue when replacing the light over the kitchen island. Whether it was intentional or a result of just proper installation, it was much appreciated! I would highly recommend Nate and will definitely use him for future services!"
5,"Nate was fantastic. Very fast, polite, cleaned everything up. I wish all service providers were as on the ball!"
5,Nate showed up early and went right to work. He fixed a bathroom faucet handle and tightened the other handles in the bathroom along with stripping out the old caulk in our master bath shower and recaulked it. Nate also looked at my doorbell and even ran to a home improvement store to buy a replacement and came back and installed it for me even though this was not on the original list of items for him to do. He was very professional and I highly recommend him.
5,"My very old front porch light fixture bit the dust and needed replaced ASAP for security/safety. I found Nate's Company and he immediately contacted me. Everything went great! He arrived on time as I took a couple of hours off from work for the 8:00 a.m. appointment not knowing how long it would take. Nate actually came over early to accommodate my schedule even though he was already booked for the whole day. I talked with him while he did the removal and installation of the light fixture. Found out he does all handyman jobs, not just electrical, so told him about other home repairs I need done down the road and will contact him again!"
5,FANTASTIC job especially under the circumstances. took everything in stride where some may have walked out. am actually compiling my list to have him come to our new home to do some work.
5,"Nate worked around my schedule so that I could leave work and meet him at my home when he was available. He was prompt, courteous, and professional. The work was done in a manner consistent with my expectations. He did an excellent job."
5,His services will be provided by the end of August.
5,"I had issues trying to install them myself and needed professional help. Based on my past experience working with Nate, I called him. We set up a time 2 weeks away as he had a full schedule for the next 2 weeks. He called back within an hour saying he was around my part of town and could install them right away as whatever he was working on hit a snag and needs to wait for parts. Within an hour we had perfectly installed curtain rod, he even touched up one of the sconces that I chipped trying to install, saving me $$. He is very punctual and professional and mild mannered. He would be the first one I will call if I need any handyman services."
5,Awesome! Nate came when promised (quickly) and timely! Did the job quickly. Looking at the many jobs I can have him come back to do.
5,It went very well and he did great.
5,"He mounted the TV to the wall. The work he did was excellent. He also did work at my gym doing various jobs. He was very fast, responsive and efficient. I would use him again and his prices are reasonable. He also utilizes his time very well."
3,fan -he removed one cosmetic part from the fan and it does not look nice without that part especially when this fan is in the living room
5,Actually worked very hard with old wiring installing new fans and light packages. nate was very professional and punctual. I would use him again any time and highly recommend.
5,Provider was very punctual. Work was done very quickly and professionally. I would recommend service to another customer
5,It went great. He even waited for me to change a parts. Great services .
5,He was very thorough and professional. He was friendly as well.
5,It went great! I’ve already had him back to do other work for me.
5,Nate was professional and he called ahead and arrived on time. He went right to work installing 2 fans with lights and a remote switch. One was on a vaulted ceiling about 12 feet and he had no problem completing the task. He is very nice and quick. In and out in about 1 1/2 hrs. I will definitely use him again for other projects.
5,Nate was great! Very professional and did an outstanding job.
5,Nate is very responsive and does an excellent job. He is courteous and professional. I would recommend his services to anyone looking for help on household projects.
5,"He was on time, which I really appreciated. He also did a terrific job! He did what he had to do, cleaned up everything, and was out quickly. I am very satisfied with his work."
5,Perfect. I'm glad I used this service instead of doing it myself. He was on time and very professional. No issues whatsoever. Nate had the work done in about 1 hour. Amazing. Highly recommend.
5,Nate was on time and communicated quickly. He installed everything in a timely manner and gave us a quote just by listing the jobs needing to be done. I would recommend Nate to anyone else.
5,We were happy with the work the gentleman gave us. The service was done right after the purchase was made. There was no extra charge. He did a very good job. It was a great service. It was a great deal. We enjoyed it and we plan to do it again.
5,The work done by Nate was great. He was able to installed quickly and without any issue. I will use his company again in the future for another project in my garage.
5,"They did a great job. They did the job very shortly after I bought the big deal, I don't remember at this point in time. It went over because I had them do a couple of extra things. He was just friendly, smart and hardworking guy. He's just the type of person you'd trust having in your house and he's making sure he's always doing the right thing. He didn't seem like the guy that he would cut corners at all. He always wanted to do everything 100% or not at all. I will absolutely use him again."
5,"Great. Fast and efficient. Very professional, and nice, guy."
5,"Great, no problems. Everything went as expected."
5,"On time, attentive, courtious. Texted the night before for verification and made sure we had all the parts we needed. Be very careful and lock up your pets (I had a cat get out and and to take off work to find her, even though he was warned). I think $180 was a little steep for about 1.5 hours work, but it was something we couldn't do, and he was very nice enough to give us the name of someone we could rent a ladder from should we need it in the future."
5,Nate and I had to reschedule the first time around because I didn't have everything that was needed to move the first fan from a flat ceiling to a vaulted one. He was very punctual and professional and was able to complete the install in less than 2 hours. I would definitely recommend him!
5,"This gentleman was very professional, however, I decided to go with another company instead."
5,"We were very appreciative of Nate's responsiveness and willingness to do the repairs as requested by the buyer of our home, so that the sale could go through on schedule! His prices were also very reasonable, especially considering the variety of repairs completed."
5,"Great. Nate is a neat, very professional worker . When I asked h to repppp"
5,"Everything went very well with Nate. He was punctual , knowledgeable and a good communicator. Would use him again."
5,"Nate did an outstanding job! It was definitely worth the money! Nate was punctual, professional and even cleaned up! I would definitely hire Nate again!"
5,I ended up paying more than the $99 Big Deal purchase price because the Deal was for two fans and I had four installed. The price was good and he did a good job.
5,Fantastic - excellent - professional.
5,"Nate arrived promptly and communicated his arrival, was very professional, explained what he intended to do and gave me my money's worth. Couldn't ask for a better experience with a service provider. Highly recommended."
5,OMG. Poor Nate. no one had any idea how bad it was under the tiles---but he powered on like a trooper--was always working and the floor looks fantastic and no more cat smell!
5,"Everything went fine. He installed a water shut off supply valve for a toilet, he re-wired a fluorescent light fixture, installed a shower surround in a bathroom, and adjusted front door striker plate that had been sticking. He also did some caulking."
5,"Nate was awesome, did a fantastic job. Would certainly hire him again."
5,The man came out and stated they couldn't do the work unless I had the parts. He was very nice.
5,"Install went well. Nate was a cool professional guy. No mess was left. he was quick, would mos def use him again."
5,"He was punctual, quick and courteous... we had to troubleshoot the fan that hangs from a drop ceiling. His ingenuity and flexibility won the day. Job well done and I will hire again when I need another fan installed."
5,"Nate was on time, he listened to my requests. He installed both the light fixtures. It is hard to find handyman like him. I am absolutely using him again, for my next job."
4,"Nate was professional, timely and did good work. Three of the installations were very high. We rented a ladder which he helped my husband unload, load and bring back to the rental place. He has a great sense of humor and was very responsive. He increased the price, which I think was fair, but it ended up being a little higher than I expected"
5,"Nate did a fantastic job and we considered the price to be very reasonable. In addition,Nate was flexible with his schedule and very accommodating. We are very pleased with the end result and will utilize Nate again in the future for any additional projects or repairs in our home."
5,We realized the fan was shipped without the blades so Nate was nice enough to come back a second time when the blades arrived to hang the fan. He did a great job. He was very responsive and very professional.
5,"Excellent work - Thanks Nate. If you need things done around your house - this is the guy to call. Very neat, professional, and understanding of your needs. I found him to be responsibly priced, efficient, and caring."
5,"I had an animal go through my screen door and ruined the screen. Found Nate on AL and he was able to come out that day and fix it. He was very easy to work with; I wasn't able to meet him so he trusted me to send me a bill later for payment. I was very impressed with Nate, and will call him again for all of my future needs, and, being a Realtor, will refer him to my clients"
5,"Nate arrived on time, had everything he needed to perform the tasks we contracted. The ceiling light went up without a hitch in about 20 minutes. I then mentioned that I would like his help installing our microwave which would complete the installation of new appliances in our new kitchen. He agreed and despite some difficulty with changing the bracket and conversion of one brand to another, it went pretty smoothly. The amount of effort he put into the installation of the overhead fixture was impressive. He was not going to leave until it was done properly, professionally and looking better than the work done by the builder's contractors in installing the light. Nate seems to be able to do just about anything around the house, interior or exterior. We spoke about some other possible projects that we wish to undertake in the future and he will be first on my list to call. Thanks, Nate for being part of the Angie's list family!"
5,Nate arrived on time and got right to work. Nate was not only friendly but he also got the job done. I would absolutely use Nate again.
5,"I was very impressed with his work. He was on-time and completed the job to my satisfaction, I will definitely use him in the future for additional projects."
5,"He was great. It was the 99 dollars for the big deal. It was just him. He was great. He was pretty much in and out. He did the work, the fan work and rewired the pad. He was fine. It was just him. He was fine. It was like within a week of buying the big deal that he got it done. I don't remember him being late. I don't remember what time he was supposed to come but his work was fine."
5,"Very professional, responsive and he did a great job."
5,"Nate responded in an expedient manner to our request for a timely service. We had two jobs which had to be completed prior to our household goods being delivered to our new residence. Nate understood our situation and came out the next day. Nate was very personable, quick, neat, professional, timely, and affordable. We couldn't ask for a better experience. I highly recommend his services and we will utilize Nate in the future."
5,He was so attentive and got back to me right away. He came and took alot of extra time on the job. Nate was very courteous and made sure to complete everything before he went out of town.
5,"I called Nate the day I received the smoke detectors via UPS and he gave me an appointment the very next day, which was excellent. The smoke detector in my bedroom was continuously chirping, so Nate's prompt appointment was greatly appreciated. He did a very good job replacing the old smoke detectors with the new ones. He was punctual, efficient and professional. I am very happy with his work and I intend to use his services again in the future."
5,"I had a great experience the first time using Angie's List. After going through tons of reviews I settled on Nate Handyman Service and was quite pleased with the entire transaction. Nate is professional and friendly. After I bought the coupon for ""2 ceiling fans/light fixture installation"" I asked Nate if he could work me in within the next few days as I was having out of town guests within the week. Nate was more than accommodating and kept in contact with me via Angie's List / cell phone up until the time he arrived to install my lights. I will say that Nate was quite patient with me when I realized that I missed several areas of my DYI painted chandalier as I completed a few paint touch-ups. He was also able to give great guidance on proper ceiling height for my lights. I will definitely use Nate Handyman Service in the future!"
5,Nate was very professional and worked well on each of the projects. He was neat and efficient. Nate is a very nice guy and I felt very comfortable with him in our home. I look forward to having him back! I would gladly recommend him.
4,My experience was okay. He came out on time for the appointment. He was courteous and professional. Scheduling an appointment took a while and I had to call them to get something scheduled.
5,"If there was ever a ""perfect"" handyman experience this was it ! Honestly, after a string of ""Handyman Specials"" gone wrong or at best just barely OK.......This was PERFECT ! Response, punctuality, professionalism, everything just as it should be. Nate two fans down and installed two NEW fans in less than 2 hours. Very polite and respectful young man."
5,"Nate was a little backed up schedule-wise when I purchased the deal, which was fine, because I had a lot going on for a couple of weeks myself. He did reach out to me once when he had an unexpected opening the next morning, but I couldn't make the appointment work with my schedule. When my schedule started to open up, I gave him a call. We arranged a date and time roughly a week out. He texted me the night before he was scheduled to arrive to confirm the time would still work. He showed up promptly, and in under 30 minutes had the outdoor light installed. Then he went to work on the fan, which he wrapped up in about 45 more minutes. Nate is a friendly, efficient handyman and after wrapping up the fan, he spent a few minutes with me talking through options for a door issue I have in one room. I asked him his thoughts on it and if he could replace the full-sized door with another option and he was frank with me about the cost and complications around that and recommended I speak to some folks at Lowe's who specialize in door installations for a less expensive option. I appreciated his honesty. We always need a good handyman for general things around the house, and I asked for Nate's card so I could call him again the next time something comes up that we need help with. I highly recommend him and his work!"
5,On time and quick. I left the house and when I got back they were both up and working. Would use again!
5,"Nate was very quick to respond when I purchased the deal on Angie's list. A few days later I had to reschedule and he was actually able to work us in even earlier than was originally scheduled. He replied to all my emails very promptly. He called about 30 minutes prior to arrival, which is helpful to a busy mom who spends more time in her minivan than at home. After he installed one of the fans, I realized that I purchased the wrong size extension rod. Nate had to take down the fan and reinstall it with the correct length rod. Because of this, it took a lot longer than expected, but there were no additional charges for having to take down the fan and reinstall, even though it was my mistake that I purchased the wrong length rod. We will definitely use Nate again in the future for various handyman jobs, and are thankful that we found him through Angie's List."
5,We have tall ceilings which was not a problem for Nate. Some places we called charged more for high ceilings. He had to make some adjustments to the brackets which he did with no problem. One of the fans was a little wobbly so he even came back out to fix it when he was in the area. I would not hesitate to recommend Nate.
5,"Nate was so nice. He fit us in at the earliest slot in his schedule, which was very much appreciated! Very professional, prompt and did very nice work. Will call Nate again for other work!"
5,"He did a great job. ALL of our fixtures turned out to be challenging installs, but he was able to get them all up. The chandelier is about 10 feet up in the air over the stairs landing and so he had to hang over the railing at the top of the stairs and balance himself on a ladder over the 10 foot drop to install it. If we need anymore lights installed I would definitely use him again."
5,"We initially bought the 2 fan installation but then decided to add additional work such as the dimmer and moving one fan to another room. He was very professional while assembling the units by cleaning up after each install and was very respectful of our home, and then he did the additional unexpected work without a fuss. He was promptly on time, very reasonable and competitive in his pricing, pleasant demeanor, and great workmanship. We would highly recommend him and his company."
5,"Nate was extremely responsive, very professional, courteous and very competitively priced. He was able to meet both my requests in terms of providing a free estimate as well as scheduling and performing the work. Overall we are very happy with our to use Nate and look forward to calling on his services again the future."
5,"Nate arrived a little early, which was fine. We had originally asked him to hang three drapery rods, but only had the hardware for two (our fault). He installed them quickly and also repaired a bedroom door that was sticking. He was polite, easy to get in touch with and I thought very reasonably priced. Not only will I use him again, but friends have asked for his number."
5,Nate was responsive to my request and provided a much needed service. He put together both ceiling fans and installed them in a little over an hour. Originally he was booked out for 3 weeks but was able and willing to move his time frame up. I would definitely use him again.
5,"He was able to accommodate my schedule. He was friendly and professional. Came in and went straight to work. Seemed to be a nice guy, and was in an out in about an hour. I'm already planning to hire him again."
5,"It went really well. I had them install a ceiling fan and it looks really nice. I supplied the fan and there were no issues with the installation. Scheduling was painless and easy, too. I'd use them again."
5,"The service was great. Nate was punctual and friendly. I showed him the projects I wanted completed, and he started right away. Both the ceiling fan and outdoor light work great!"
5,Nate was on time for the job and replaced everything as asked. He showed me how each fan worked and pointed out that the marks from the previous fixtures might need some touch-ups.
5,I purchased Nate's fan installation deal. Nate was an absolute professional. He got the job done and gave me a great price to install an additional light. I will absolutely use him again for other jobs as I have them. He exactly what I hoped to find by joining Angie's list.
5,Nate was very professional. I would highly recommend!!!
5,Nate installed four sets of shutters for me. He was easy to communicate and schedule with and even came out twice because we discovered (when he was here the first time) that one of the sets of shutters was damaged and had to be re-ordered. He made multiple trips to home improvement stores to get the correct anchors and drill bits so that the shutters could be installed correctly (in brick) with the screws that came with the shutters (which were already painted the same color as the shutters). I will definitely call Nate again.
5,"The installation couldn't be scheduled as quickly as I would've liked, I also could only use 1 voucher per residence. 9I needed to install 4 lights.) The communication from the service was excellent."
5,He is very pleasant. Nice appearance. Would definitely not hesitate to call him again.
5,"He was punctual, friendly and went above and beyond the call of duty. Rode to Home Depot with me to get new fixtures and was a saint and patient."
5,"We set up an appointment for two weeks out and the day before he started contacting me to my cell phone. My cell phone was dead and he tried email and finally went to Angies list and looked up my home number Talk about thorough and persistent. He contacted me and confrmed our appointment and showed up on time and started work immediately. The job was perfect, he was pleasant and you would make a mistake not to use him."
5,"We scheduled a time and he came over. Unfortunately, he was not able to install the lights due to the odd wiring behind the existing light. He said that since he was not a licensed electrician he was not able to mount the lights with complete certainty because the wiring was so old. He was very polite and nice about the situation and told me to send you guys an email for a refund on the money. Thank you!"
5,Nate went out of his way to stop by the house on his way home from another job to fix our soffit.
5,Nate did a great job. He was very professional and I would use him again and recommend him to others.
5,"Nate was very responsive when first getting the quote, and that that continued throughout the project. He showed up on time, did a great job ( in the blistering heat ) , and cleaned up when done. Very easy to work with and that is a huge plus. We would not hesitate to work with him again."
5,Nate was on time...actually a little early and went right to work. He had a good understanding of what to do and how to do it. He kept the areas clean while working and moved the furniture back in place when the job was completed.
5,"Job was great! Nate was here when he said he would be, cleaned up all debris, moved the old fans to the garage for me (without asking), and moved the bedroom furniture back into place, again without my asking. I would definitely use him again."
5,Nate arrived right on time and did a great job. He was extremely professional and pricing was very fair. We will definitely use again.
5,"Nate did a great job, and I would recommend and use again in the future!!!!"
5,Nate was very professional and everything went off as expected - no unpleasant surprises. Couldn't ask for anything more.
5,"Nate was very professional. He answered my message promptly, as well as my additional messages. He was on time & did a great job. I would highly recommend him. He replaced the two shutters that had fallen of the front of my house & did a fantastic job staining my deck."
5,"Nate was fantastic! Hard worker and smart. He had to install 2 fans in rooms with old electrical wiring and make it work. One room had a low ceiling and he had to figure out how to install a fan flush mounted - it was missing the original pieces for flush mounting but he figured it out. He reinstalled this fan after discovering the fan would be too low with the extension pole - he didn't complain or object, just did it. He had not previously installed an undercounter light fixture but was able to figure that out as well. It was a tight space and hard to remove the old light And the new light actually had a small plastic part that was broken causing one of the bulbs not to turn on. He used super glue and got it to work. Can't say enough good about him. Very professional - returned my calls, showed up on time, did an excellent job and cleaned up. Will definitely use again and recommend highly!"
5,Nate was very friendly and professional. He did a fine job which met our expectations
5,"Nate did a fantastic job. He was punctual and professional. He switched out one fan for another. He also took down a long florescent light and put up a new, very different fixture. He was thorough and patient with a potentially tricky job and made sure I was happy with the work. He also was very easy to communicate with and flexible with scheduling. I would not hesitate to hire him again in the future. In fact, I have already recommended him to a friend."
5,"If you stop to check another provider in this category, you're wasting your time. Nate is the guy you want. On-time (I was actually a few minutes late), organized, knowledgeable, personable, creative...there is no reason to use anyone else. If the job is in his wheelhouse (and he'll tell you if it is), then give him the assignment, stand back, and prepare to be pleased. Remember, I told you up front that you're wasting your time viewing any other provider's listing. This is the guy you want."
5,"When I first bought the ""Deal"" Nate sent me an email saying he would try to schedule me in right away, Within 2 weeks he called me to set an appointment. That same day he came over and installed my 2 lighting fixtures. He was efficient, and very professional."
5,"We are so grateful to have found Nate. We contacted him based on reviews from others. He was very friendly on the phone, and was punctual the day of the appointment. He spent 8 hours at our office helping to hang curtains, pictures, etc. What we are most impressed with was the fact that he is a problem solver. We realized half way through that there was no way for the curtain wires we purchased to work with the builiding infrastructure. Nate immediately suggested an alternate solution and even volunteered to go to Lowe's to get all the parts. Our office looks amazing thanks to him! We will definitely contact him again."
5,"It went really well! I've had no issues since they did the install. This was the first time I had used them, and I would use them again in the future as well as recommend them to others."
5,I purchased the deal on Sunday and he worked us in on Monday and did an excellent job. Will use him in the future.
5,"He did great work. He called me within days of me buying the coupon and then, he came out and I had them install very high ceiling fans. He had all his own equipment. He is very clean, neat, and fixed actually another overhead nook because the siding has not aligned up right where he was putting it. He fixed that for me as part of the process at no charge. I just spent the $99 Big Deal."
5,"They did a wonderful job, cleaned up and everything was fine. I will use them again in the future."
5,"Nate is nice, professional, and did an excellent job. His pricing is reasonable. I have asked him to price out additional work for me. I totally recommend him."
5,"Nate is FABULOUS!!! I contacted Nate by email through the Angie's List link. He responded to my email by end of day, came to review our needs within a day, gave us ideas of possible solutions to problem areas, and provided a quote that evening which included labor and materials. I scheduled a date for job to be within a few days. He arrived on time and went right to work. Nate is very detailed, knowledgeable, efficient, professional, and went the extra distance to assure my satisfaction. He cleaned up the area as he finished a job. When finished, he walked through with me to be sure he fulfilled all jobs and to my expectations. He assured me that if we had any problems to let him know. We couldn't be happier. We DEFINITELY recommend Nate. He is very personable, friendly, and clean cut...a pleasure to work with and have in our home. Thank you, Nate. We will see you again!"
5,"Nate arrived promptly on the day of the appt. I showed him the fans to be installed and the extra downrods I purchased for installation. Nate explained why the extra hardware was not needed (which was great because I saved money) and began work immediately. He took pride in his work, including ensuring the fans did not shake when turned on higher settings. I am very pleased with his work and plan to use his services again."
5,Fantastic Job! Nate does a professional job!
5,Nate went item by item through the home inspection report and took care of each item. He purchased caulk and other items and only charged for the amount of materials and work that it took. I would definitely use Nate again if we ever need any type of handy man services!
5,"Nate was terrific. He called, we set up a time, he arrived on time, did the work, cleaned up, left. One of the fixtures was a bit difficult, but Nate solved the problem. He's also professional, polite and pleasant. We've got other projects for which I will be calling Nate."
5,"We spoke over the phone about the project, and after I explained what I wanted/needed done, he told me he had never done an electrical box swap. I appreciate his honesty, but have found someone else who is more experienced with that to do the project."
5,small problems finding a time that worked for him and us. but after that everything was perfectly done. He worked very h****** one of the exterior lights that had a poorly installed box. To the point of pulling it off and re-installing it.
5,Nate was on time and professional and did not make a mess! I will use his services again!
5,Great! Nate is the best and I am a very hard to please customer!
4,He did it very well and was very nice and professional. I planned to have him back to put up the paneling but I'm having to wait for Dry Pro to correct the flooding when it rains in the basement.
5,"Nate was easy to reach and responded quickly. He set the appointment, reconfirmed it and appeared right on time. We ran into a couple unexpected issues in installation which Nate handled easily and cheerfully. Very professional in his interactions with customer. His work is well done, good quality. I would highly recommend Updates by Nate and would use his services again."
5,Nate showed up on time and completed the job in a timely fashion. I would definitely use Nate again.
5,Nate was great! Very professional and an excellent job. I plan to use him again soon.
5,"It went great, he did and great job."
5,It went great. He installed ceiling fan an and remote in less than 1 hour; then replaced the Entryway light in less than 1/2 hr.
5,Nate arrived right on time and went straight to work. He managed to install a light fixture that needed a few alterations in order to work. These two installations weren't the standard and he did an excellent job with no complaints about the time it was taking. Definitely would hire Nate for future projects.
5,Very efficient. Nate is the best! Very professional! Outstanding work! Would use him again!
5,"Nate is very professional and does great work. I called him on a Thursday morning and he informed me he was near my home and he had an opening in his schedule that day, so he came out and gave me a quote. He had a cancellation late in the day and called to ask if I wanted him to stop by to perform the work and I said yes. Nate had to get on our roof that was 30 ft high but did not have a ladder that would reach that high. He quickly came up with a solution - renting a longer ladder from Home Depot so he could fix the shingles. When he completed all of the work he walked me through the house showing me what he did and asked me if it met my expectations. His work exceeded my expectations and I will be using him again for items in my new house."
5,"Nate arrived a little early. He called in advance to ask if it was OK to come a little earlier and let me know he was on his way. He was extremely polite and professional. He asked me several questions to make sure he would install the fans to my satisfaction. After he was done with the job he put everything back to where it was and cleaned up after himself. You would have never known he was here, let alone had done a repair job. I would definitely recommend him to any of my friends and I will hire him again in the future."
5,Very good and very efficient.
5,Great and professional
5,GREAT AS ALWAYS WHEN I CALE NATE.
5,Nate showed up on time and completed the installations in a timely manner and disposed of the old fans as well.
5,"Called Nate to see about getting a few things done around the house. He was able to stop by within a day to see exactly what I wanted done; texted me with a quote that same evening. Although he was booked for that week, and I expected we'd have to push to the next week or the week after that (which would have been fine with me - none of the jobs were critical), he was able to make it out late the week to perform the work. He arrived a little early and set to work. He patched two holes in the powder room. I had previously had a tolilet paper holder in the wall, but when I had someone install crown molding in that room, the installer stepped on the tp holder and broke it off from the wall. It was easier to remove the whole thing and patch the holes than to try to reinstall the tp holder arms. While the patch work was drying he began working on installing the cat door. This gave him a little bit of a fit and took more time than I think he anticipated. But I do think that was because of the quality/design of the cat door itself and had nothing to do with Nate's ability. I do think the job might have been a little easier if he had had clamps to hold both pieces to each side of the door, but apparently he didn't have any (and neither did I). In the end, he ended up adding an additional screw to the top of the cat door to make it a little more flush to the door (again, a quality/design issue with the cat door). It works perfectly fine, although after installation I did end up removing the flap as my cat didn't want anything to do with going in and out of the door with the flap on it. Without the flap he uses it just fine. And last but not least, Nate removed an existing light fixture and replaced it with a new one I had purchased. We had initally agreed on another job of removing an existing and installing a new over the range microwave, but after Nate had removed the old non-working one and taken the new one out of the box, we discovered the new one required venting to the outside of the house (for the range hood part), which is something I don't currently have. Nate was honest in that he didn't feel comfortable doing that type of work. So he repacked the new microwave and we called it a day. I am pleased with Nate's work. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him and to use his services again for any basic household repair. Additionally, I think is pricing is very, very fair."
5,Would highly recommend Nate. High quality work and a pleasure to deal with. Will use his services again.
5,"I loved the service that Nate provided, he came on the first day to install 2 light fixtures, he arrived right on time and installed one light fixture but the other I ended up picking the incorrect style for my ceiling, so he had to return a second occasion to put up the correct style, he arrived again right on time and his work was great, not only does he do fabulous work , but he cleaned up all the boxes, that was great! I will use Nate again and I have already told my neighbors about the good work he does. Thanks so much!"
5,"Nate showed up early (!!!). He was very conscientious and personable. Before the appoinment, we spoke on the phone. He asked me about the height of my ceilings in reference to whether he would need his ladder or not. He was sure to ask me if I was content with the work that he completed before he left. I am pleased with the work that he did. I actually decided at that point that I would like to use Nate for other work. So once he was finished, we walked through my home and went over my 'punch-list', in which I have several things about the house that need attention. Nate let me know what, if any materials it would take and also let me know an approximate time frame in which the work could be completed. I am happy that I chose Nate's Big Deal because now I have a ""Go-to Guy""! Thanks Nate!"
5,"Nate always returned my calls quickly. He was on-time for both the estimate and the work. He completed all the work in about 3 1/2 hrs. Nate went over all the jobs showing his completed work and even fixed a problem with the kitchen faucet that I didn't know I had.He vacuumed the rooms up after his work. I think that the price was reasonable for the work done. I can't speak highly enough of Nate. He is a hard-working,conscientious,younger guy who is looking to grow his small business through quality work at a reasonable price. Kudos,Nate!"
5,"Nate did a great job on the original work we hired him to do - he was courteous, punctual, hardworking and offered ideas that were helpful. We recently hired Nate again to handling our house closing punch list. Nate came out on very short notice due to our time constraints and worked extremely hard all day long and into the evening to get the list completed. I'm not sure we would have been able to meet our requirements without Nate's dedicated effort. He's a bright, hardworking guy that I would recommend to anyone."
5,"Nate was timely and professional. He went above and beyond the job, to help us remove a few large items from the house as well. I would definitely hire Updates by Nate again!"
5,"Nate was punctual and did a fantastic job. I needed two lights to be hung. Unfortunately, one of the lights was missing some of the pieces so he could only hang one of them on the first visit. Nate was very accommodating and actually came back for a second visit to install the second one. Overall, a great experience and I would use Nate again for services."
5,"Nate did a fantastic job on this project! The back patio area was a mess - dirty concrete, moldy fence, overgrown trees and dead bushes. When I got home I hardly recognized it after the work he had done. Working with Nate was a great experience from start to finish - he responded to my first call quickly, scheduled a time to meet with me soon after, provided a very reasonable fee quote on the same day, planned the time to do the project within the next week, and then arrived and completed everything as planned! Would definitely hire him again and recommend him to friends."
4,It went fine. There was an upgrade fee for the ceiling fan remote. I thought that it was a great deal. I would use them again.
5,"I purchased an Angie's List Big Deal for this service and it went well. He was very professional, did a great job and he is going to come back to install one more ceiling fan that I did not have parts for during the initial installation. I was very impressed. He was very kind and cleaned up after himself. He left no mess which I appreciated."
5,It was a good experience. I had several things for him to do and he accomplished everything in the allotted time frame in a professional courteous matter. I have used Nate's services before and plan to continue as my needs arise.
5,"He went above and beyond what I expected. He figured out how to install the fixtures not meant for the fans and fixed an existing problem caused by the original builder. Nate stayed longer than he expected, did more than he expected and added no more charge for the unexpected."
5,"We have done so much updating on our house for some reason we never followed through with some of the major lighting fixtures. That is, until we saw a special on Angie's List for two installations for $99. Always a bit nervous about hiring a handyman, because they're as hard to find as a good/honest mechanic. So, we checked out Nate on Angie's list and decided to take a chance and take advantage of the special. In the end, it turned out to be one of the best decisions we've made! Given the horrendous weather of late, Nate was running behind schedule on his other jobs, so he asked if he could work on a Sunday at no additional cost. Well, that certainly worked for us. He arrived exactly on time (actually 10 minutes early :-) )and went right to work. Very professional, knowledgeable/clean-cut and friendly. What also put our mind at ease was his pride in his workmanship. You pay per job only after it is completed and only after you are totally satisfied. Kind of funny, but on one of the fixtures, which was a challenge (we knew it would be), we were happy, but he wasn't and kept working until he was satisfied. In fact, so impressed were we by the finished product, in addition to the two fixtures on the special we had him install four more and do some repairs on our kitchen cabinet shelf. Again, we couldn't be happier with the outcome. So happy, we're having Nate return in a couple of weeks to do some major repairs on our backyard fence."
5,He arrived right on time. Installation was flawless. He made sure they were in the right spot and that the chandelier was hanging at the right height. He was very thorough in cleaning up. He even patched the holes from the previous fixtures. I will definitely call him for handyman services in the future.
5,It went great. He was very professional and paid a lot of attention to the detail of the work and the stability of the fans.
5,"Nate installed two ceiling fans in my house today. He arrived on time, was very polite, and did an excellent job at installing the two fans. One fan was installed on an angled ceiling using a down rod at about 14 feet high. I asked him several times if there was any additional charge for the angled ceiling and he said no each time, explaining that this was the quoted price. High integrity. He even came back after leaving when we called to say we could not figure out how to work the fan! Will definitely call him again for my ongoing house update projects."
5,"Nate responded extremely quick after I purchased the deal and scheduled the install for the following Monday (today). The original ceiling fan was installed in a non-standard manner, but Nate used his extensive home-improvement experience to persevere. The results are impressive! I plan on hiring Nate for other projects around the house and highly recommend his work!"
5,From start to finish my experience with Nate was great! You can tell he takes pride in what he does and his finished outcome proves it. He was on time and worked efficiently. He was very courteous and made sure I was happy with his work. His prices were also very reasonable. I would recommend Nate to my friends and family and will use Updates By Nate in the future.
5,"I have used Nate for handyman tasks in the past. He is courteous, fast, and dependable. He has done some painting, siding repair and carpentry work for me. His pricing is reasonable and I would recommend him."
5,Perfect. He was quick and neat.
5,Efficient and professional.
5,went very well and he was so nice
5,Nate did a great job!
5,All went very well
5,No problems. He knows his job.
5,The service went well
5,Nate was on time and very nice.
5,work was done perfectly.
5,Great no problems
5,Excellent!!!
5,Went well
5,....
5,Great
5,"FAST, PRECISE AND CLEAN."
5,He did an awesome job.
5,went well
5,See above. All went well.
5,Great
5,Absolutely great service.
5,Excellent job.
4,It was fine.
5,Great!
5,"I originally hired House Doctors to do a deep cleaning of a newly purchased home. They did an absolutely amazing job! I have hired them for regular cleaning services plus an occasional deep clean. I've been extremely happy with the service. They have been reliable, professional and accommodating. I've used their services now for several years and rely on them. Highly recommended!"
5,"I can't recommend House Doctors highly enough. Lori and her crew have been cleaning my house for three years and I've been 100% satisfied every time. They go out of their way to make sure your needs and requests are met and that includes fitting you into their busy schedule. I also want to mention that if you're moving or just packing things away to store in your home, House Doctors provides that service. Recently I moved and had House Doctors pack for me. This was something I couldn't handle on my own and they stepped in. Not one items was broken or chipped. Talk to Mike or Lori about the services they provide -- you won't be sorry."
5,"We love The House Doctors and use them whenever we have a home improvement project to do. Mike, the owner, is extremely responsive and really cares about the work his team does. Darrell handled the painting for all of the projects (he had done our front porch earlier, so we had confidence in his professionalism and work). We also had a large hole in the ceiling of a closet that they repaired superbly. It's like the hole didn't exist. Oh, and they installed a ceiling fan in our master bedroom with skill and ease. We can't say enough good things about the way House Doctors handles its business, and we have recommended them to friends. We recommend them to you as well."
5,"I was very much more than satisfied with all the work. They: Obtained all necessary supplies, did an excellent job matching the stain on the doors to the surrounding trim, showed up on time, were professional and polite and checked with me numerous times to see if I liked what they had done. The best thing I can say is that I WILL call them again for some additional projects I have in mind!"
1,The owner never called to schedule an appointment or called to inform me that he had chosen not to do the work.
1,"Overall I would say that the project started well, and much of the work is good quality. Mike started working for us back in late November, and its now April. He has basically quit the job with a lot of touchups still outstanding. Mike’s Crew (Daryl, Mark, and Matt) were constantly late, and rarely worked a full day. Their inability to show up at a reasonable time and stay more than 4 or 5 hours put the project multiple months behind. We also had to have them correct many things that they didn’t do well. Mike further has nickel and dimed us thousands of dollars for his own crew’s delays and mistakes. We have tons of texts, receipts, and more verifying this. We have security cameras all over the home that also document their hours. We’re trying to sell the home, but it’s not ready due to his inability to finish the job. We have to find another contractor to fix the poor drywall repairs to the ceiling in the family room, and touch up the kitchen cabinets they refinished. We will have to pursue legal action against Mike for incomplete work to recoup some of the costs. It’s absolutely absurd that we have had to deal with so many project delays, and that they’ve been unable to finish the drywall repairs to the ceiling. I’m completely shocked by such poor project management and the end result. We were trying to list the house for sale this month, but now have to endure further project delays to deal with the mess that Mike has left us. There’s literally so few things to finish. Besides actually fixing the drywall we spent thousands on, he still has to fix the cabinets his crew messed up, and complete a few small work items and touch ups. The cabinets do not shut properly and some are crooked. They also had to resurface them after spending weeks and leaving tons of flaws in the paint. A lot of the baseboards look bad because they didn’t caulk them. There’s countless paint touch ups. Etc. I really only think there’s a couple days worth of work for him to just send a competent crew out to fix. We’ve paid $25,000+ to Mike. It’s just sad how poorly this project has panned out. I have been helping my father update his home so it’ll sell quickly and for a profit. If Mike were just to actually finish the project we would be elated so we can just put this behind us."
1,I had rotted wood replaced on my garage and a shingle replaced on the house. After 5 months of replacement the shingle came off. I called the company 3 times and left messages to contact me. I received no response even though their tape message states they will contact you in 24hrs. I tried to e-mail to get a response and received none. Very unprofessional to not give any response to people they did work for. Beware they will respond to do work however if the work is not correct they will ignore you. I noticed on the 1 star reviews that are similar to mine the response is the same. That response is usually I have no records of the calls. I do have records of my calls and my e-mail so come up with another response because that one is getting old.
5,Mike Vecchio from The House Doctors is an absolute pleasure to work with. One of the few companies who actually came through with an estimate for a major rehab of my screened-in porch and other items. Mike's team (Mark and others) arrived when promised and worked on this job for several weeks until it was completed to my satisfaction. There were many facets to the job and the team was communicative throughout ensuring I was in agreement with everything they did. They even constructed a custom doggie door as part of the project! Reliable and trustworthy. I recommend The House Doctors.
5,"I originally started with looking at concrete platform steps which needed footers that proved too expensive. The House Doctors provided me with alternate options using treated lumber and backfilling with gravel. I am very grateful to Seth and Mike for working with me to understand the challenges, come up with alternate solutions, and work within my budget. An excellent solution that ended up saving me $5000.00"
4,"The foreman of our project did a good job and was responsive to our requests to get things done in a professional manner. The owner of House Doctors set appointments to finish up the project after we had paid and then his men didn't show. This happened more than once. After a final walk through we paid, as indicated but over the next several days we determined the additonal cost for repairs did not justify the quality we received. I requested a 2nd walk through with the owner to make adjustments but he did not get back with me. We finally worked things out with the company and overall are satisfied with the quality of the finished project."
1,"I reached out via Angie's List for a quote, included detailed description and pictures...no response. Called two separate numbers and left voicemails...no response. Believe it or not, I then sent a detailed email with pictures....a woman called an apologized for previous lack of response and an appointment was set....no show!!! After I had cleared furniture, draperies, etc. I called the same day, left message. A woman called me back a day later and left a voicemail, apologized and said contractor had Covid and they had to reschedule his appointments....FOUR strikes, they were definitely out! I did not return the call. I hired PatchMasters, also on Angie's list. They do not have any reviews, but they are a national company and after speaking with Joseph Gilliam, who sounded very sincere, I hired them and they did a great Job!."
3,Repair to drywall was excellent but window is still leaking.
5,"The project went very smoothly. Chris and Joe from the House Doctors were very prompt, courteous and competent. The remodel was completed ahead of schedule and looks beautiful. I'm looking forward to working on the next project with them."
5,fine. He also found damage to the bricks in the chimney and repaired those.
1,Horrendous from the get go. Initial appointment they came without any of the tools to do the range hood install. After waiting weeks for appointment they had to reschedule. Told me they'd come the next day only to call me after id taken off work to say no they need to reschedule. Wait several weeks again.. Called me day before the next appointment to say they have to reschedule again. Everytime they ask me about deck painting. I remind them its for a range hood install and fence staining. They are impossible to get a hold of and offer no help. With covid I realize delays happen but how can I trust they would do a good job when they don't even know what project they're supposed to be doing and can't even make a single appointment happen over a 2 month period. Would never use again.
5,"It was wonderful. The whole experience was very pleasant. The technician was polite and professional. He worked steadily the whole time he was here. He cleaned up after himself. He went out of his way for me because at the time I wasn't well. When we went to Home Depot to buy the supplies he went and brought me the handicapped shopping cart and taught me how to use it. At the end of the shopping he picked me up at the door. No swearing occurred. He also asked if there was anything else he could do for me so he did a few other small tasks that I couldn't do for myself at the time. So he did those for me as well. When I need work done for the house, The House Doctors are the people I call."
5,"Very quick, and did a really good job."
5,House Doctors did a really great job. Very happy.
5,"Seth was a delight to work with, personable yet professional. He explained the work and was very meticulous. Others were brought in to help with the list of tasks."
5,"Mike was a pleasure to talk to. His crew showed up on time and took seriously our pandemic-related concerns. The quality of the work met our needs. I liked that the crew leader suggested that they take care of a smaller issue in the basement while waiting for some of their work to dry, which would otherwise be down time for them. When the pandemic clears, we have a list of small projects that need to be done, and we will give The House Doctors another call at that time."
5,Great. Mike and Matt showed up on time. They were friendly and knew just what they were doing. They built a solid wood foundation and leveled it nicely. They told me when they arrived that some of these sheds are more time consuming to assemble than people might expect and got permission to stay longer if necessary. Turned out they got it all done very quickly and efficiently. It looks great. I've used House Doctors before for work inside my home and it went well so I was glad to call them back. Another very good job. I recommend them.
1,I suspect that the House doctor will show up at my house expecting his $165.00 service fee. Do I need to purchase the caulking prior? I just don't want any caulking I need something that will last. He never called me to discuss expectations or what has to be done. I am so frustrated. I do not know what to do. This is the worst experience I have ever had hiring a contractor.
5,"AMAZING! Great results, better than I hoped for! Seth is meticulous, professional and friendly! I couldn’t be happier!"
5,"Excellent , great communication. Did a great job."
1,"Contractor did not return my phone call/voicemail. Can not recommend when even a courtesy return call was not received. This was the first such repair I have had to make and had no direction. Was looking for guidance on repair, or at least materials, cost, etc."
5,Mark and Mike did an amazing job installing some bird guards on the outside of my bathroom vents. They were super nice and professional. Great sense of humor as well. I will be calling them for my future needs around the house.
5,It was great from start to finish. They worked in a professional and courteous manner. The quality of the work was excellent. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
5,"Excellent! Great communication, friendly, Did everything I asked. Hard workers. Perfect one stop shop for everything I needed to get done. Also they have deep cleaning service that is excellent. If you need help getting your house ready for sale, and/or cleaning I highly recommend House Doctors."
5,"I am so pleased with The House Doctors! They were super responsive via email, text, and phone during the entire process. They came out right away to give me a quote and outlined everything via email. They came out a few weeks later to complete the work and had two guys complete the project. The men estimated that the work would take 3 days and it only ended up taking two! I had a relatively complicated project and had asked The House Doctors to move my laundry room from the basement up to my second floor. My house is over 100 years old, so I wasn't sure what to expect. This project required them to move electric and water lines through two floors of my house. I had 5+ companies actually come out and give me a quote, each had a very different idea on how to complete the project. The House Doctors had the easiest answer on how to get the work done with the least amount of work and their pricing was very reasonable. The two workers were so friendly, knowledgeable, patient (they answered all of my questions and took time to explain things to me), and prompt. I am amazed that they also left all of the spaces where they worked cleaner than when they arrived (they swept and vacuumed after each day). I will absolutely work with The House Doctors again for projects around my house."
1,"Terrible, they gave me a time frame never showed, never called!"
5,"Fantastic! My Mother was prepared with sheets to drape over the furniture and was planning on having a cleaning done afterwards. None of that was necessary because the crew covered every inch of the room with plastic sheeting. We were forewarned that it might be difficult to blend the patch with the rest of the ceiling, but ultimately it looks fantastic. We also had the crew examine the attic space above to see if there was a possibility of another, future leak, and they were kind enough to do so. My hope now is that the crew from the condo association did an equally good job repairing the roof on the outside as the House Doctors did repairing the ceiling on the inside!"
5,Very well. Brian was punctual. Clean. Professional and I sat with him while he worked and I was asking him questions and he was very polite and answered all my questions. I felt we knew each other for awhile. Definitely would hire him again and a matter of fact I already called him again
5,Our experience has been fantastic! Our elderly mother needed help with housekeeping and Lori has been amazing. She and Mom have developed a great relationship and Lori has been more than flexible with the schedule. We are very pleased with our experience!
5,Lori and Dawn arrived exactly on time. They quickly got to work and the house sparkled when they were done. Both Ladies were extremely professional and friendly. I am thrilled that I decided to hire the House Doctors for my house cleaning. Best decision that I have made in a while. I highly recommend the House Doctors.
5,Besides $375 for a one man job that took an hour- I’m relieved because two separate 2-man crews from Home Depot could not and would not try to complete it. It sounds ridiculous after watching and seeing a working micro wave that it was such a process but the House Doctors saved the day! I will definitely call them again for our next handyman project. Super nice guy & I was super comfortable to have him in my home with a newborn. He called the day before to confirm and when he arrived in my driveway.
1,"DID NOT EVEN SHOW UP FOR THE QUOTE OR CONTACT US TO LET US KNOW THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO MAKE IT. IF SHOWING UP FOR A QUOTE IS A TOUGH JOB, I CAN'T IMAGINE THEIR WORKMANSHIP..."
5,"Mike and his crew did a really good job with the work that was done in my home. When Mike came to my house to give me an estimate for the work to be done, as I was talking to him about the things that I wanted repaired and the work to be done, I was very impressed with his wealth of knowledge and as the homeowner, I really appreciated the fact that Mike explained to me in detail what they would need to do for the repairs for the things that needed to be fixed. After his crew completed the work, the work they did looked really good and you could tell that the work was professionally done. They also completed the work in a timely manner. There were just a few minor things that I wanted to be touched up afterwards and Mike was great with following up on those. When I brought them to Mike’s attention, he followed up with me on the same day and he took care of them in a timely manner (he scheduled a date/time to do the touch ups). Mike and his crew were also very nice, and pleasant to work with. I will use The House Doctors for future work to be done in my home because they do work that’s quality, and looks good as well as looks professionally done."
1,I received an initial call in response to my request for a quote through Angie's List. No one showed up to the scheduled appointment. I have since left two voicemails over the past week to follow up and reschedule but have not received a return phone call.
5,I will hire them again. They were professional and they did a thorough job. They brought their own cleaning supplies and they did what I asked them to do.
5,"Lori and Dawn have now cleaned twice for me and do a fantastic job! The house just sparkles and smells so nice and clean when I get home. They let me know when they arrive, when they leave and are very pet friendly. I love that they will wash windows and pay attention to small details like my makeup mirror, even wiping down the refrigerator or sweeping off the deck if I ask. Great decision to make a move to House Doctors."
4,They were very responsive to me for my having contacting.
5,"Mark did a great job replacing the water-damaged floor of our sink cabinet. ETA was 9:30-11:30 am. He came at 10:00 and was done in 3 hours, including a trip to Home Depot for supplies. Great work! We are going to have The House Doctors do our whole list of repairs we've been putting off for years."
5,"In preparation for listing my home I had a laundry list of small things to complete. At this point I was already out of town at my new job and wasn’t able to work on these things myself. Mike and his wife Lori did a great job dealing with things like ceiling and trim painting, carpentry, and an entire deep cleaning including windows. They responded quickly, dealt with my hectic schedule, and got the work done in time to list. Thanks to the great final touches they put on the house I received two offers during the first open house."
5,They are doing an excellent job including working around my very difficult schedule.
5,Lori and Dawn have AMAZED me once again with professionalism.. These girls come prepared for work.. Always so polite and ready to get the job done. My house looks and smells amazing!! Thank you! So excited recommend them to my friends and family..
5,The girls (Lori and Dawn) were AWESOME! They were very professional and thorough... They were extremely polite.. I will definitely be using their services again and again!! And will be recommending them to my family and friends..
2,"Called to schedule estimate. Lauri was nice and responsive. The day of the estimate Mike was running late. He was very nice when he showed up. I showed him different things like carpentry, the kitchen ceiling, and some plumbing. We discussed what he would do. He said he'd give me my estimate to me via email, I didn't receive my quote. I called the office and Lauri said she will have him call me. Weeks later he called me, but he told me he was very busy and he was primary care giver for his sick father. He said he would send it the following weekend. Weeks went by I never heard anything, so I called back saying that I didn't get the estimate and that I'm anxious to get this work done. ***UPDATE (6/4/19): I received a message from the service provider last night about the estimate but was unable to answer. Of course, I didn't hear back from him until I posted this review. He said on the message that he sent the estimate the following day after I spoke with Lauri and that he was waiting to hear from me. Yet I got a phone call from him weeks later about his father and he apologized saying his father is ill and he's backed up but that he would send the estimate the following weekend. Why would he say to me that he sent it right after I contacted his wife about it when I didn't hear from him weeks after that. The story about the estimate doesn't add up. I even called him after saying that I didn't get the estimate the second time he would send it to me. Due to this I left him a message this morning advising that I have moved on and have found other contractors. It’s unfortunate that we couldn't get and work together, but I've moved on now."
2,"Once I was contacted , an appointment was set . They were a no call no show , and didn't return my calls after the fact"
5,"House Doctors have been cleaning my house for a little over a year and they are wonderful. Lori and her crew are always on time, bring their own supplies and equipment, and make my home sparkle. They are pleasant, efficient, and will do whatever needs to be done. I'd had doubts about hiring a cleaning service and now wonder how I managed without House Doctors. If it was possible to give an A+, I would do it in a heartbeat."
5,"Until recently, I have always cleaned my own house but I've just become too busy to keep up with baseboards, windows and deep cleaning. Thank goodness for Lori and Dawn! They are professional, conscientious and genuinely nice to be around. They really seem to enjoy cleaning and our house sparkles when they leave. They're always on time and work very efficiently. They bring their own cleaning products and equipment but they will use your vacuum and products if you prefer. Lori always seems to fit me into their schedule when I need them and I'm really grateful for their help. Prices are very reasonable too. I have always had very good experiences with the House Doctors!"
5,I love them!!!! They are thorough and professional and made me feel as if I was their most important client! Their work is superb! I highly recommend them!!!
5,Fine. Very satisfied. They are hard workers.
5,Everything was left clean and in order. The people are very friendly. I was very pleased and would hire this company again.
5,Jim did an excellent job successfully completing a long list of home repairs in a professional and timely manner. He gave accurate time expectations and suggested better options for solving lighting issues. We would defiantly hire House Doctors again!
5,"I have been extremely pleased with this company! I had initially hired the company for a deep clean. The work was done so well that I went back to them for a regular biweekly service (approx. 2,800 sq. ft with a pet). The ladies are very pleasant, reliable and thorough. On the occasions that I've been home, I've noticed that they NEVER stop working! I'm thrilled to have found such a good cleaning service and can give an honest Excellant AAAAA review since my house is always spotless after their work."
5,"Super! I had hired House Doctors late summer 2018 to help at my son's family home after they'd gone through serious illness and been overwhelmed. That job had gone SO well (see my prior review), I recently asked my son if they'd like to have that happen again. They would, indeed! And so once again, we are 100% pleased with every aspect of this housecleaning service. I/we would hire them again in a heartbeat. Courteous, professional, thorough, caring, efficient are but a few of the accolades that fit. Thank you so much, Lori and Gail!"
5,All the guys who participated were friendly and professional. They showed respect for our home. They communicated with us on any changes needed but also listened to our input. Pricing was very reasonable for the job. I will use them again!
3,"I contacted this company requesting a deep house cleaning. They were prompt in responding and setting up an appointment. The price seemed reasonable -for a deep clean- and the two women showed up when promised. In the initial text conversation I was instructed to make a list of everything I needed done, which I did create. One of the women reviewed the list multiple times throughout their time here but somehow managed to miss approximately 50% of what was listed. Most of the half that was actually completed was decent work but not a “deep clean” by any standards. Some shelves of a few different units were dusted; remaining shelves of the same unit were untouched. One of the women stood on our coffee table to dust a ceiling fan even though they brought a step stool. They forgot their vacuum so they asked to use ours, which was no problem but they only used it in 2 small areas. One of the women told us that it didn’t take much time because the house was not dirty but then I overheard the other say (unprompted) “We are house cleaners, not miracle workers.” If my house needed a miracle to be clean then why did the job take two hours? I would have been happy to pay for more time if the things I asked for had been done. We won’t be using or recommending this companyin the future."
5,"House Doctors performed quality work for a very reasonable price. The wok was completed efficiently and all area’s left clear. I ha Ltd a challenge finding a contractor to complete these small jobs, but Mike came out and assured me that they could get it done. Mike came out to review the work completed by his employee (Mark who was very good at his work), and ensured everything was completed to y satisfaction before I had to settle the bill. I would hire them again for any project I have in the future."
2,"I want to be clear that the job was done well, the person showed up on time and the person who did the work was very professional. However, what happened AFTER is the problem. SInce I wanted to pay by credit card, the workman told me he would have the office contact me to pay the bill. Long story short: I was literally chasing this company down, for nearly a month, to pay for the service rendered. They told me they would call repeatedly, then did not. I could have lived with that but, when I did finally reach them to pay the bill, I wanted to schedule an estimate to get a ceiling repaired. I was put on their schedule, and that time came and went, with no phone call or appearance of anyone. Needless to say, I hired another company and would recommend that anyone dealing with this one be very cautious."
5,"It was a big change from dark navy to creamy off white, and they did an amazing job. They arrived right on time. They helped rehang the curtain rods and did a lot above and beyond what I would have expected. I will recommend them to friends and family."
4,Mike and his workers did a great job. It seemed as though the ball was dropped by the front office. I needed to call multiple times and the lady on the phone was pleasant but seemed a little disorganized. Overall they did a great job and I would hire again.
5,"Courteous and prompt service in all the work throughout the year. Exelent attention to detail, and reponds promptly to manage the high quality of work."
5,"Mike and his team arrived promptly on the day of service and were friendly and professional. The work was completed and Mike left, but after seeing some pictures later in the day my fiancee wanted some changes made. Mike made time to come back out the same evening to do the additional work and was still very friendly. The banister looks great and is well built, and we are very happy with it and Mike's professionalism. I recommend House Doctors and will be using Mike's services again in the future."
5,"It was good. It was excellent service. They were nice, they were pleasant. Bill is very very nice person. The way he talked and treated me. I do like the way it turned out. I would hire them again."
5,Crew arrived at appointed time and all projects completed. Very satisfied. We will certainly use them again for any other repair needs.
5,I was super impressed with the timeliness and ability to ask questions to help with project. I was told what exact door I needed to order and dimensions which made the decision easy for someone like me who doesn’t have time or skill to do these type projects. The door removal was complicated due to how the previous door was put in by former owner. The project took 6 hours due to it and I know that it was beyond what he estimated. I offered to pay extra for the time and work that went into it and mike declined. I would hire them for my next project. I hesitated to write that part cause I know it helps business but don’t want them to be (selfishly ) too busy for me. Lol
5,"Good work done. Looks good and was completed quickly once started. Cleanup was very good. Communication could have been a little better, but overall was good."
5,Wonderful. Mike is a very friendly guy and he basically helped me to feel less stressed about getting all this work done on the house in order to sell it. He did everything I needed done and a great job. I would definitely hire him admin!
5,"Very well. As always, the work was done as we were told it would be. Mike & his crew were professional, answered our questions, and completed the jobs in a timely manner. We were pleased with everything."
5,Excellent - The house doctors were professional & did a thorough job.
5,"Excellent! Workers were polite, professional & successfully completed my project. I will be using their service for future projects."
5,I call these guys when ever I need anything from a chandelier hung to a floor replaced. They are now my first call. Love them!
5,"Well, will be using them in the near future..."
5,Mark was great! I would definitely have him again. Very pleased with how my door turned out.
4,"Accomplished promptly and professionally. I wanted to ask about something, but they left before I could do so."
1,"This went horribly. They first contacted me two days after I submitted my project need to Angie's List. That should have been my first sign of trouble. I then described my issue in detail to the woman who sets up the appointments for Mike and we agreed they would come to my house on October 12th between 2 - 3 p.m. to look at project and quote it. I told her this was an urgent matter as we can't currently use that bathroom because of the leak. She assured me they could work quickly. October 12th came and at 3:36 p.m. I received a call saying they couldn't make it out during the window because of another job. No kidding, it was already past the time they agreed to show up. She then said they would come later that evening between 6 - 7 p.m. Of course they didn't come and said they would definitely come on Sunday (two days later between 3 - 4 p.m.). At this point, I wasn't confident if they would ever show up. Mike did ultimately show up to my house 5 minutes before 4 p.m. My father let him in to explain the issue. Mike looked at the issue and said they don't do plumbing and left. So after wasting two weeks of my time and missing two scheduled appointments, they ultimately said they couldn't do the work. Why couldn't they tell me that when I FIRST described the issue? This was the worst experience ever! Perhaps he is good at his job, but their customer service was terrible. Will never call again!"
5,"Mike was attentive to our needs and answered all of our questions. Various members of Mike's crew performed different parts of the repairs & painting. ALL members of Mike's crew were courtesy & professional. Based upon our positive experience, we decided to hire Mike & his crew for additional services."
4,"Mike was very nice, professional. Was there when he said he would and did a ice job"
5,"Fantastic! This was for my son & daughter-in-law's home in another city (where House Doctors is) and they were *wonderful* to deal with, both by phone and in person. Great job--everybody's SO happy! Even the young kids, arriving home from school, went wide-eyed, saying, ""Whoa! This is super!!"" Not that anything was terrible before but health issues had prevented normal levels of cleaning for some time and House Doctors' housecleaning took everything over the top. Kudos! The price was right for two people / three hours and I would hire again in a heartbeat if the occasion arises."
5,"Amazingly well! Very pleased! I hired this company to clean, freshen and organize my son's family home after they'd faced many months of very serious illness. I live in Florida but my son's family is in my home city, so I am familiar with suburban locations there. This company was courteous and kind, helpful to the Nth degree, efficient and thorough. Their pricing was appropriate, in my opinion, and I would hire them again in a heartbeat should the need arise again. They cleaned a three-level residence (3 bedrooms/2 baths - top floor; kitchen/dining room/playroom/living room/2 bedrooms/1 bath - main floor; rec room/bar area/laundry - lowest level). Two people for approx 4 hours, as agreed. Son and family thrilled. As am I. And I want to apologize for being so long delayed in writing this up."
5,"They were professional, friendly, polite and thorough. When done, it looked like a new room. They left everything spotless."
5,I’m very happy with the job the House Doctors did for me. We started taking wallpaper down from a bedroom and realized it was too large of a project for us to do DIY. The walls needed repairs and the rest of the wallpaper needed to be removed. Mike was very professional. He gave me a quote and started a few weeks later. It took one week to complete just as promised. And final payment was about the quoted price. I’m now going to get another quote for a bathroom remodeling.
5,The crew was both professional and friendly. They also kept us informed when they found something unexpected. I would say it went very well. These guys worked very hard and definitely know their craft.
5,Went well. The deck and front steps look very nice. They matched the stain perfectly on both.
5,Work went smoothly over several days. Very good attention to detail.
5,"The only reason for the 'B' in responsiveness is that there was a miscue between their office and the owner as to the appointment date and time. Date we were given was 6/26. The owner had our appointment for 6/27, so we waited all day on 6/26 for nothing. Now, the owner (Mike) did call us the evening of 6/26 and apologized profusely for the error. He had two young men come out on 6/27 and they were very nice, respectful, and hard working. They did a great job, even in the rain. I would very much recommend The House Doctors."
5,"Everything went well as promised. The crew had to replace rotten wood on the porch pillars, and we suggested that they replace damaged lattice before painting. Mike added in the extra work but kept the cost affordable. I have been dealing with the house doctors for at least 10 years. I will continue to use their services, and recommend them to anyone, who wants to deal with an honest company that does quality work."
5,They were very professional they showed up on time my porch looks beautiful all of my neighbors are giving me compliments on my yard I would say it went great.
4,"They did a good job, but got confused about the address and so missed the first appointment. Had to reschedule."
5,"Excellent. High quality work, all requested details addressed, crew was easy to work with, good communications, all work done in a very timely manner."
5,I am very happy with the results. The porch looks beautiful. Jim did a good job.
5,"The owner’s wife is an angel! She was extremely accommodating even though I contacted them with an urgent short time frame, they made it happen! My daughter’s room was perfectly painted with paint to spare. I would have given THD all A’s but the painter who arrived at my home was not very friendly when I spoke to him on the phone. He was slightly arrogant. With that being said, he did an awesome job with no mess. At the end of the day, I got what I paid for. The owner’s wife friendly disposition and great customer service made up for my interaction with the painter. Maybe he was having a bad day? I would definitely hire them again."
5,We had a playground and basketball hoop installed poorly by another company. Mike and his team came and fixed the area to make it safe and look beautiful. They added playground mulch and framed out the area nicely. We are very happy with the work!
5,"There was a laundry list of small to moderate repairs needed for point-of-sale inspection plus a little drywall refinishing from a recent plumbing issue. Mike and the crew at The House Doctors handled scheduling with both tenants, all supplies and materials, and completed the repairs pretty quickly. The price was a bit higher than I was hoping, but to have someone who could handle all the aspects of the job (painting, windows, small electrical, minor masonry, downspout, siding, pressure washing) was very convenient."
5,"The project went well. It turns out that there was more work involved than initially scoped and Mike was fair about the price of that work. His quote was detailed, clear and complete. He was very responsive and helpful. His staffperson made sure to clean up after the project and was very friendly. The only reason that we rated a B on price was that it wasn't the least expensive proposal on the table, but it was worth paying extra to make sure the job was done correctly."
5,"When the tiles in my 1952 Bungalow home starting crumbling off the shower walls, I attempted to correct the situation with a DIY surround. Finally the surround started to show tears and mold (see ugly ""before"" photos) and I got estimates for a partial and full bath remodel. I happened upon The House Doctors and they completely transformed the room. I could not afford to remodel everything at once, so they accommodated my budget by completing the project in 2 phases, something other companies would not do. The room is beautiful and, just as importantly, the shower is now safe for my elderly mother to use (see after photos)."
5,"Very well. Lori and Kim were very pleasant and professional, and did a thorough job. They brought their own supplies. My furniture and mirrors shine, and the bathrooms are so clean and smell so good."
5,Did a great job on soffit which was very high up on very tall house blended repair in perfectly with existing molding to the point you wouldn’t know it was repaired unless you knew it was rotted. Repaired bed room ceiling and Spanish style plaster work perfectly and repainted so you would never know it was not original ceiling.
5,The service was exceptional at every level. Lori worked with me to re-schedule when the mailbox was not delivered on time. The gentleman who assembled and installed the mailbox did a great job. I’m very pleased.
5,This was my first experience with a professional house cleaning service and it was fantastic. Everything was done to perfection. I'll be calling House Doctors again and have already recommended them to several friends.
5,"Very well. Was a big job, in that it was customized for us. The entire bathroom had to be changed, to make it accessible for a walker. It is beautiful and functional. Everything we requested was done. Chris and Pat were always pleasant and professional, and kept us informed of any changes. They were helpful and made good suggestions."
5,"Lori and Erin are true professionals. They got right to work and stuck to their tasks. When they were done, everything sparkled and was as clean as a whistle! They saved me much time and labor. I am completely satisfied. I for sure would hire them again. And I will also recommend them to others."
3,"My provider was limited for time because I had a doctor's appointment, but the work that was done was not thorough. My bedroom was supposedly cleaned, however, the large closet floor was never done and the window sills were also not cleaned - I had to remind her. She cleaned the bathroom but neglected to clean the fixtures in the shower. I would have assumed she would know what to do. She did leave a follow-up call to complete the amount of time paid for, but I have had some medical problems and did not call her back - yet."
5,It went well. Jobs were finished up as quickly as possible. In some cases workers even stayed late to beat the weather coming in.
5,"Mark was very prompt and professional, and the new sills looked great. Would definitely hire them again."
4,We we're ecstatic that this could be done at such a reasonable cost. The workmanship was top-notch. Very pleased with our contractor.
2,The roof repair estimation is twice of another company. When I told the Representative the next day when she called. She hung up the phone on me while I was talking. Won't recommend to anybody in the future.
5,Jim did a beautiful job. I am happy I had the work done. Porch looks great.
5,"A gentleman from The House Doctors came out and, luckily, the problem was not extensive and within a few hours he was able to cut away the damaged wood trim, determine the wood underneath was fine, and the repair was very well done at a reasonable price. We are having The House Doctors return soon to install a handrail on the ""modern"" style stairs to our basement that have no rail, repair 2 doorknobs, and clean our gutters."
5,Good. the ladies were nice and worked efficiently. I have so much more to be done and it was nice to have them give me a break. Thank you!
5,"Great. Mark was punctual, worked efficiently and was knowledgeable in all areas of work performed."
5,Good communication! Very personable! Job completed in a timely manner! Complete clean up! Thank You.
5,"As usual with this company. The work is excellent, the clean up perfect, the staff polite."
5,"Very satisfied with results of the work as well as interactions with the House Doctors on bid, scheduling and job completion. Jim had excellent work ethic, was timely, efficient, easy to work with and did an excellent job."
5,Mike came right away to give us an estimate and was able to complete the work within a week. Very pleased.
5,I am relieved to have this work done
3,"No work was performed as no quote was received. I can't actually say if I would hire them again because I did not hire them a first time. I have nothing on which to base a review of their work, only their responsiveness and professionalism."
1,"A contractor from this company came to my home to do an estimate for the repairs covered by my homeowners insurance. After that, I haven't heard from them. My calls & emails were not returned. Have ended up hiring someone else. Am not going to call this company ever again and don't recommend."
5,"Had to work around the weather, but they stayed in contact and scheduling was not a problem. Very happy with outcome. It looks good, provider was professional and pleasant, worked well and took care of everything."
5,"The team did a fantastic job cleaning the house. They were friendly, hard working and willing to work around a contractor that was running behind. I highly recommend them for your cleaning needs."
1,"called left message, never received a call back"
5,The repairs were done very professionally
5,"This was a wood rot coupon appointment. I was glad that this company hung in there with me through a few obstacles. One was that my presence was sporadic due to a pressing family illness. The other was that we had to interrupt work a couple of times to eradicate yellow jacket nests. At the end though, I now have three solid windows, painted and well sealed. Thank you House Doctors."
4,"When I fist bought the coupon, a nice lady called to schedule but I was not yet ready. She called another time and I needed to get back to her. Then I called several times and could not get through, left messages. They did finally call back and we are all set up now."
5,"Great, the guy did a good job!! It was mostly for safety. I feel better that it’s fixed."
5,They were very professional and responded to my request for additional work.
5,"Great job by Mark. Punctual, polite, professional."
5,"Showed up right on time, tarped up the whole area, got right to work. When he left, everything was meticulously cleaned (given that it was drywall repair, that's not a joke!). Very happy about the job."
4,Okay. Contractor didn’t bring enough supplies and had to leave to pick up more.
5,"Arrived on time, got right to work. If you hire them, make sure you have a long list. They work fast and it is surprising how much can be done."
1,"Awful. We called repeatedly to set up the service. They never called us back. The last time we called, the number was for ""Perfect Power Wash."" They have our money and we have nothing."
3,"For some reason he completed just a portion of the job and neglected to finish it 100%, which I discovered when I arrived home (it was an outside task). I just prorated the payment to him to be done with it."
5,"Mark and Jim did an excellant job. They answered all questions, moved and protected furniture, cleaned up, took me to purchase material, arrived on time and worked really hard to get the job done."
5,Very well. Very nice ladies and they work very hard.
1,"Was contacted immediately via email and an appointment was scheduled for three weeks later. Estimates were to be emailed, but were not received despite several messages left at both office and cell numbers. After Angie's List reimbursed the amount paid for the original tuck pointing deal, a proposal without detail was finally received (actually one month to the date of the original appointment). The proposal was declined via email and work was completed by another contractor."
5,Job was done exactly as Mike said it would be.
5,"Very well. Everything was completed properly--floors, bathrooms, kitchen, living and dining room."
4,Did everything I wanted him to. Only hiccup was he was sent to my old address instead of the new address where the work was to be performed.
5,"He was on time, called ahead and told us what we needed. Excellent work."
5,"Outstanding quality workmanship from The House Doctors two man team, very prompt, professional, courteous, and timely execution and the crew paid attention to very detail of the job."
5,Very efficient and job looked great when completed...needed a deck of my sliding glass doors to the outside in the backyard...they built it stained and painted it and we are very pleased with the outcome.
5,Great! They determined and solved the problem.
3,They came out inspected the deck and furniture and said the washing wouldn't do any damage however after the job was done there was few spots on the deck where the stain had been removed exposing the wood. Overall they got the job done so i cant complain.
5,"Jim assessed the problem, explained what needed to be done and what materials were needed. He worked within the contracted time and completed the work with neatness and precision."
5,"They were on-time, courteous and professional. Did a great job! I'll definitely hire again."
5,"Great, l had final approval on all completed repairs. Good to find a company that would handle small jobs."
3,women was very nice but had to re-schedule on me last minute 2 different times. She finally showed up on our 3rd appointment. I asked her to only focus on a couple select rooms and just do a deep cleaning on those but it was very surface level.
1,"The contractor was 45 minutes late; Instead of repairing the wall he decided to cover it with 1/4 inch drywall. But he said I had to buy the drywall, screws, and spackling before he could start. I had planned to let him into the house and then go to work for a few hours. Instead we drove to Home Depot where I bought two sheets of drywall, a 5-gallon bucket of mud, and a box of drywall screws. Then I helped him load his truck which wasn't big enough for the drywall so both sheets got damaged when he squished the sheets into his truck. His work looks ok but he took the leftover screws and the 5-gallon bucket of mud (it was probably 75% full when he was done)."
5,"The carpenter/handyman work, excellent Confusion at the office."
5,"Came to the house, measured for wood trim. Bought trim & installed. Did nice job on trim & door."
1,I made an appointment with House Doctors for 8/14/2017. They never showed up to complete the job. I left two messages with them on 8/14/2017 about not showing up. They have made no attempt to contact me about the job that I hired them to complete in my home.
2,"I purchased a deal on Angie's and never was contacted by the company. I submitted the Angie's List scheduling request form, emailed their direct email address and called and left a message. After a month of no contact back, I asked Angie's List for a refund."
5,"I hired “The House Doctors” for the wood rot package. I thought there was going to be a problem as no one showed up at the arranged time, and no one called. After I called in twice, Jim, the man who was actually going to do the work called, and explained that his co-worker had had an emergency. I was pleased to hear that he could come later that day! I thought it was a bit odd that the office never call to explain, or apologize for the inconvenience but had their pro call, and no follow up call either. Thus the lower grade on “professionalism”. Their pro, Jim was great! He did a nice job (and I am somewhat picky), and he was quick. He accomplished more than I thought he would in the four hours allotted. I really appreciate, too, that he deferred from any finish work, as that is not in his wheelhouse, rather than hack his way through those. Halelujah!"
5,"They did an excellent job, even adding a few extra touches here and there (i.e. paid to paint upstairs shutters but also painted downstairs shutters to match, made slight changes to back deck at my request with no added cost.) The workers were friendly but focused; they worked hard from the time they arrived (between 10:30am and 11:30 am) till the time they left at the end of the day (usually 5:30ish pm but once as late as 7:30ish pm). Their workmanship was superb. I am definitely happy with this company. I will definitely hire House Doctors again for any work on the house we may need in the future."
5,Very detail oriented & professional
5,They did a very good job and cleaned up everything. The guys were really courteous and communicated their progress throughout the four days it took to complete . Most of the contract details were communicated by email and they were always timely getting back to me with any answers or changes I requested. Pricing was slightly higher then quoted prices I received but the quality of work more than made up for that and they were willing to work with me a little.
5,"Great, he was professional and courteous."
5,"Two ladies, and came to clean our apartment. They worked very well together and were very organized. They mopped, vacuumed, dusted, clean the ceiling fans, and whatever else needed done. They used a Dyson vacuum cleaner which was very highly rated on consumer reports. I am planning to use them again. They are scheduled to come July 29. r"
1,Took 2 weeks of missed and not responded t messaging to finally schedule appointment for cleaning. They didn't show nor call.
1,"I bought the $ 149 wood restoration deal on July 31st, scheduled the work for August 30th. They didn't show up the day of the appointment and didn't call to cancel or to apologize. I called the company twice, left messages and they never called me back. The worst is that Angie's List doesn't want to refund the money because is past 30 days even though is not my fault. The work was scheduled 30 days after I bought the deal because of their availability."
5,"Work was done as agreed. Wood was replaced and all areas cleaned up. Four hours was the original deal, wood rot only took about an hour, so he readily offered to do other work. Tightened stair rail and even got out onto roof of porch, and caulked sky light window that was dripping with hard rain. VERY professional, helpful and didn't make me feel stupid (which is important to me!) Thank you Angie's List for helping me find this great company. I would definitely use this company again."
5,"Punctual, professional, efficient. Also responsive to my specific needs."
4,It took forever to contact them and get a response. They came one day to look at it and told me they would have it done within 3 weeks. They actually came the next day and performed the work.
1,"Their discounted prices are reflected of the service. I will not work with this firm in the future, because of a complete lack of professionalism, an inability to answer the phone or respond in a timely fashion to a call or email, and for not showing up to an appointment. They wasted my time and I assure you will have no problem doing the same to yours. I would stay away at all costs, even if pricing is slightly more expensive at another provider. It was one of the single worst customer service experiences I have had to deal with outside of the airlines or Time Warner Cable. There are two phone numbers that are consistently not manned by a customer service representative, making it nearly impossible to get things done punctual or professionally. To schedule the appointment I left several messages via email and over the phone before I received a call back -- which came after 8:30PM when I was not available. I called back first thing in the morning and didn't receive a follow-up call until the following week. When we setup a time to conduct the work the window of arrival was between 9:30-11:30. I was unable to contact the company the morning of to confirm service times or narrow the window. I waited the 2 hours and no one showed up to the property. I tried to call to see if they were on their way or if I needed to reschedule, but again was unable to reach anyone at the firm."
5,Clean up was done well.Both contractors did good work kept things neat do during their work.They did not rush their work therefore quality was good.
1,No one showed up on scheduled appointment day.
5,Very well. The workers were not rushed but performed their tasks thoughtfully and thoroughly. I was particularly pleased that a few extras not included in the original quote were done to finish the job. I had not made a request for the extras but was thrilled to see that Jim had taken the initiative make the finished product look great. Mike the owner was responsive and communicated effectively. I would hire them again.
5,"The person arrived within the time frame we were told. (I can't remember his name) I asked him if he could take a photo of the damage so we could see what it looked like. He took his cell phone and took a photo of it. Once he started the job, he kept us informed of any issues he ran into. He was very friendly and helpful. I would use them again."
1,"When they initially contacted me after purchase I was told they didn't have any openings for 3 weeks and I scheduled that. The week of the appointment they called on Mon to cancel the Wed appointment because they said it might rain (it didn't). They re-scheduled for the next week (now 4 weeks since purchase). On the day of the appointment no one showed up and no one called. After I called and left messages they called to re-schedule and said they didn't have any appointments for 4 more weeks (that would be 8 weeks after purchase), I said that was unacceptable, they said they would call back and I never heard from them."
1,"The process started out well. House Doctors came highly recommended, and I knew they could do all of the work I needed. I met with Mike who took good notes and talked through the job, and seemed interested in the job. Unfortunately Mike never provided an estimate despite a followup phone call. I was unable to proceed with this company."
5,"Mark was conscientious, took 2 hours, cleaned up."
5,It went very well! No problems since then.
5,I was very happy with the results and will use them again and recommend them.
5,The plumber that I had worked with for many years from this company was not available. The plumber they sent out was good we just had a little problem getting dates and times set. The plumber was very knowledge and worked hard to get to the root of the problem and well as providing advice as to what is need in the future to prevent this problem .
5,Mark was great!! Worked efficiently and did a nice job
2,They came to your house without any kind of identification. They did not clean up after. It wasn't the best of jobs.
5,"Mike, the owner, was prompt in providing an estimate. He offered suggestions which would enhance the work we wanted done so we agreed to include that. They were able to schedule us quickly because of a cancellation and Mark and Jim arrived on time, even earlier than promised, which worked out well for us. They installed two new handrails with backboards for each on the walls of both stairwells. They stained the one to the second floor with a stain which matched the sashes on our windows. Additionally, they painted the walls and ceiling going from first to second floor. At my request they left the backboards and rails to the basement unfinished. They repaired drywall in first floor bathroom and painted the walls. Then installed the decorative grab bar. We found the quality of their work to be excellent."
5,"The crew was open to communication and feedback. They helped solve some problems, such as unexpected chipping due to uneven cabinets. They were cheerful and professional. I would use them for the whole house if I had the money."
1,"Called and set up an appointment. On the day they were to come out, no one showed. Called both the 440 and 216 numbers shown in their ad to ask if they were going to be late, or if they wanted to reschedule another day. Got voice mail at both numbers and left messages. It's been two weeks and still no response. By some of the reviews, I would have to guess that they do good work when they show up, but a quality provider should be based on more than just the work performed. Professionalism is also measured by courtesy, dependability and consistently."
5,Great. I am also getting estimates on future projects as I would hire them again!
5,The House Doctors cleaners showed up on time (2 for 1.5 hrs) and did an excellent job of refreshing the house -- it smelled great after they left! I would definitely hire them again.
5,"excellent job, fast and thorough, pleasant and friendly."
3,1st guy was done by a guy who was full of confidence but left pieces of glass everywhere on the ground. We didn't see it at 1st because dry leaves were all over the ground but there were shards of glass everywhere- very dangerous. The 2nd window was done weeks later by another guy & it was fine- all picked up.
5,It went very well. He was very detailed and put the stand together very professionally. It looks great in my living room.
5,"Instead of having to call one company for one thing, another for something else, and yet another for another thing, I just hand them my list of work and they get it done. I've used them numerous times, the approximate cost of service for this review is for the latest work they did. This time the work included regrouting exterior brick and a complete replacement of an asphalt driveway including adding drainage and hauling away the old asphalt. The pricing is in line with what I expected to pay based on the amount of work needed this time, and I got compliments on multiple occaisions from the city inspectors on the quality of the work they did (including the driveway replacement work). They're good about working around my schedule and that of my tenants. I work second shift and Mike will meet with me after I get off work. And they schedule with my tenants to make sure work that requires they enter the tenants place is done when the tenants want it to be done."
5,"Excellent. Prompt, efficient, did everything I asked and I was very satisfied."
3,"I called customer service and was refunded, but still hanging for work I need done"
5,"Awesome. The workers were kind, polite, professional, and very hard working. I will be using them again."
5,They were very professional. On time and worked hard. Was nice to have the areas cleaned that I needed focused on.
5,2 women came to clean within 24 hours of the purchase and did an excellent job. The work was thorough and they were especially considerate of the fact that I was a cancer patient and coordinated their work around my need for rest during the 3 hour period they were there. Highly recommend their work and their consideration.
5,"Mike Vecchio is the perfect mix of friendly professionalism, and his quote for the job was what I thought it would be, so I accepted his bid right there and he fixed my siding the next day. His company does everything related to home maintenance and repair, and I was happy to find that his brother does landscaping, too. I look forward to doing business with this company in the future. Thanks, Mike!"
5,Awesome service. Well worth the money. I will definitely be calling them for more work in my house.
3,The handyman acted put out by anything I said. Door handle removed to try and replace on storm door. put back in after not acceptable replacement. Door handle found a few weeks later on the porch. I have never had this problem before. I wanted an updated version which is why we were trying to replace I let the boss know No response
3,"Hurried through it and would not finish the ceiling at my request. Came about 1/2 hour late and then took a lunch for about 20 minutes and then acted as if he had to hurry to next job. So, terribly unprofessional. I only got 2/3 of my time and I found chipping on the wall under some dry wall he had repaired. Texted his boss and ""cool"" was the reply. Apparently, he thinks this passes as good service as well"
1,"I initially called The House Doctors and left a message to schedule an estimate. Laurie called me back a couple days later and gave me a different phone number to call to schedule. I called this number several times over a three day period and nobody ever picked up and the voice mail was full. So I called the main number again. Laurie got back to me and scheduled an estimate for Monday March 27th between 1-2 PM. I drove an hour to get to the house where the work was needed. I arrived at 12:30 PM and sat in a lawn chair in plain sight in the driveway reading a book from 12:30 until 2:30. Nobody showed up and nobody called or texted to say they were running late or wouldn't be able to make it that day. I had to turn around and drive another hour back to my current residence. Laurie left me a voicemail two days later, looking to ""get me scheduled for an estimate"", as if I was never scheduled in the first place. No mention of the missed commitment. I work full time and go to school full time, so my time is very limited. I wasted an entire day of my valuable spring break on an estimate I never received."
5,They come in time and keep working for three hours for the move out cleaning. They are very polite and did a great job.
2,"This episode was disappointing at best. I hired a cleaning service to do things I am not physically able to do with my disabilities. What I don't like about Angie's List service is they take my payment first, before the contractor shows up. Sure, if they can't do the job they can turn it down and my money is refunded. But if they accept the job and then do it lousey, where am I? I spoke with owner prior to making appointment. I was assured this type of cleaning was not an extra charge item. I was also told on the phone that the ad was wrong, it was TWO (2) people for 3 hours. I offered my cleaning supplies (Lysol, Pine Sol, Comet cleanser, bleach) I also offered to presoak this mess with wet towels for a day before her arrival, to facilitate it's removal. She says no need. She wants to scrape it with the scraper I provide (and she almost took home with her in the end) She wants to use her Simple Green. OK In the back of my mind I'm thinking: if I have a basement covered in wet towels, and she turns down the job, well now I have to deal with all the wet towels. Owner tells me she has 6 dogs, so is accustomed to cleaning pet mess. In my mind that means she understands the concept of getting it all clean, and deodorized, otherwise the pet will return to that place over and over to poo again. Owner shows up alone for appointment with a list of explanations why her helper called off. I don't care, it's not my problem. Why did she not call to reschedule? 20/20 hindsight, I should have told her upon arrival either come back when your helper is with you, or work here for 6 hours yourself, or give me 3 hours of your time for 1/2 the original price. Otherwise it starts to smell a lot like ""bait and switch"". I try very hard not to micro manage people I hire. I do give very clear specific instruction what I want done, and i make suggestions as to how to accomplish that task in a time efficient manner. Then I walk away, let them work and check in to see the progress every 90 minutes or so. I think it is very unprofessional for a vendor to make small talk with a customer and start telling me all about your medical problems and operations. if you are not physically able to do the job, find another line of work. I started in my kitchen by showing her TWO (2) buckets of cat box scoopings that needed to go to the garbage can. Once they were empty she could use them in the basement to clean up that mess. I specifically said, ""One is full so is very heavy. You can just slide it across the floor instead of picking it up."" Thankfully I found out before she left for the day she had not taken it out and I insisted she do so. She claimed she didn't see it. Um 'scuse me, after I showed it to you? As we made our way down the basement steps i pointed out with my cane the cat mess on the steps that needs to be cleaned. Once down there I continued to point out areas the cats had pooped in, including under my bed and in the basement lav. I specifically said do not worry about cleaning the laundry area as they have not pooed there. I also said cleaning the basement toilet and offered my Comet cleanser. No she is going to use her stuff. After 90 mins I smell something orange and I'm told, come look. I'm told the orange is some sort of enzyme cleaner for pet mess. I find she has wasted a lot of time moving items out of my laundry area to clean the floor i told her not to do. She claims there was cat poo between the buckets and paint cans that had been stacked there. There is no way a cat will wedge it's butt into a tight space like that. They look for a place to dig a hole, and do their thing, then cover it. The floor is so soaking wet, light is reflecting off it. Worse yet, she moved the laundry room stuff to the cat box area, on top of the wet floor so it would take weeks to dry, not to mention mold and mildew. I insisted she move everything back to the laundry area and then gave her a work towel to dry the floor. She tried to throw away my towel. During the last hour I became the helper, in an effort to get the rugs vacuumed that i needed done so that I could wash them.. (it's a 2 person job). This person seems to have an aversion to vacuum cleaners. Although I offered the use of all 3 of mine, her first suggestion was to sweep these throw rugs with a broom. Seriously? She also insisted on sweeping the basement with a broom. After doing those rugs I was in a lot of pain and soaked in sweat; the scenario I was trying to avoid by paying money for a service. About 12 hours after she left I went back to the basement so I could see the floor better after some of the water had evaporated. I was greeted with a fresh pile of cat poo at the bottom of the steps. No surprise why. With the reflection gone from the excess water, it was obvious not all the poo was scrubbed off the floor. Sure, it smelled of orange, but the cats will still smell that poo and think it's a place to ""go"". the steps are not cleaned. a large area of dried poo by the bathroom is not clean. There is poo under my bed and in front of my shower. The toilet; well it looks as though it was wiped out with a dry rag. There are still black mold marks that could easily be scrubbed off with Comet and a sponge. Your perfumy foamy stuff isn't going to cut it. Disappointed in North Olmsted"
5,"They were great, they showed up when they said they would and cleaned up after themselves."
5,Great! They did several small jobs and he was not a clock watcher. Neat and did a great job of cleaning up.
5,The cleaning was thorough and well done.
5,They showed up on time and were very friendly and their work was excellent. Jim was a very helpful and skilled worker and our stairs look great! Definitely worth the money and would hire them again.
5,Really well - the man who actually did the work did a great job. I did have some trouble getting an appointment for the second visit (multiple visits due to materials needing to dry before the next step in the process could continue). I would call them again for any job that I didn't have a super tight timeline on.
5,Good. Came to see what materials were needed then picked them up for me. I really appreciated this.
5,Everything went well with no problems.
1,"We played phone tag for a while and then they would not call back at all. When we call the number now it's ""Pristine Clean."" If we can't get the service we'd like our money back."
3,The primer shows through the tan paint because he didn?t paint it well. He put 2 coats of primer and only 1 coat of paint. I have paneling that goes part way up the wall and the junction where the painted wall meets the paneling he left a white stripe around. He didn?t bring the paint down to meet the paneling so there is a white line that goes around it. I called to tell them the work wasn't done and that you could see the white paint through the tan paint. He said they would only fix it if my Home Insurance company agreed to pay them more. I didn't even care if he re-painted all of the work I just wanted him to touch up where you can see the white paint through the tan paint.
5,The work was done very efficiently.
5,"Great! They arrived on time, had clear understanding of project, gave true estimate of time and cost. We were kept informed of any issues and involved an all decisions. Work was perfectly performed, clean and neat. They matched existing wood stain, painted well and worked around 20 years of basement clutter without a word of complaint! All were polite and friendly."
5,Great experience. Jim was very detailed. Will use again.
4,"It was cold out and rainy, I think they guy didn't necessarily want to be here early. I probably should have rescheduled them another day. They cancelled once or twice. The work that he did do was very good. They're not as professional. Their price and work was excellent. Maybe I will use them again."
1,i purchased a coupon for drywall repair on angies list. i needed my ceiling fixed because of a water issue in the upstairs shower leaking down into the kitchen. i had a lot of trouble getting the guy to come out when promised and when he finally did the repair he performed was actually a disaster. he speckled up the damaged ceiling and when it dried it was full of huge cracks. i ended up going to Ace Hardware and consulting an employee and fixed it myself for free. The guy was super apologetic about not coming back out to fix it and had an excuse about his van being broken into and he lost my phone number....Not possible but the funniest part was at the end of the phone call when he asked me to give a good review on angies list. LMAO
5,Everything was done quickly and efficiently.
2,"The guy came in with a really bad attitude, as if he did not like his job. He used a curse word, and did a very sloppy job and dripped the drywall stuff down the walls. There was stuff all over my kitchen and floor. I found it two weeks later. I would never use them again."
1,After numerous contacts company came up with excuses and never showed up.
4,He noticed the steps and offered to stabilize it. He said he had some spare wood in the truck and offered to stabilize it for me without additional charge. Even though he offered to do the stabilization of the steps he didn't paint the new wood. I would have appreciated him asking if he could paint the new wood to match the steps.
4,Fine. The quality of the work was not all that great.
1,"They did not show for the first appointment-claimed the tech was in the E.R. When the tech did show, he looked around. The first thing he said was that he could only apply material that day-it wouldn't dry in time. He also wanted me to supply drywall topping, even though the agreement states that the contractor would supply it. He had a bag of quick-dry in his truck, which he didn't want to use-this material would have dried in 20 minutes so he could have sanded it. He just acted like he didn't want to be there. He worked 2 hours, said he was done and that I would have to make another appointment to get the project finished, and left. I called twice to speak with the owner, but have not received a call back. Later in the day, I walked outside and noticed my hunting trail camera was missing. His truck was parked 15 feet away. I did not see who took the camera. A very disappointing experience. I still have an unfinished project."
5,The painters came back and did my son's room. That was a little less... The first guy I used a coupon for but then again it didn't cover all the work. This guy was great. He actually did some extra work in the bathroom for me in-terms of fixing the drywall. He installed a new shade for me. He actually textured the ceiling where he fixed it in my kitchen. So there was a bit of correction that he did. I was very pleased. He was not the painter though. You can use all the same scores as for the painters because I combined the two of them. They were all A's but the responsiveness. I would use them again.
5,It went really well! Everything is find & we are ready for the winter.
2,It went over the 1st day @ $45.00 but was never finished. The drywall was service was started and not completed on the ceiling. The House Doctor was supposed to call back on 9/15. Several attempts were made to reach them but they never made good on it.
4,"The problem with House Doctors is scheduling. They don't get back to you very quickly and it can multiple calls to get a response. The last time they were supposed to send 2 guys for two separate deals I purchased, they sent one(who was very good) who could only fill one order. No one called to let me know and no one has return a call I placed 2 days ago to try and reschedule."
2,"The work I wanted done on my deck would be best completed by taking the $129 and put it toward tearing out and putting in a new deck. He measured, and discussed how the material would be purchased before the project would start. He would put the order in at Home Depot and I would go in and pay for the material needed to build this deck and rails. I told him that I would be able to get a discount at Home Depot if he put it in my partners name. He is a Army veteran and would be able to get the discount on the material. He said he would call me to get that information. I even was pro active and called him a week later to see when he planned to call the order into Home Depot. After that call from me to him, I never heard from anyone. No call at all. Then on October 6 at 9:30am, I got a call telling me they were on the way to do the tear out. This was not what we had discussed. How were they going to build the deck? I needed to know a week before they came to coordinate the purchase with my partner. Did they expect me to rush to get the material in one day? Again, this was not how it was supposed to be done. I told the carpenter who called me NOT to come. It already was messed up! I wasn't going to let them start after seeing the way the initial agreement wasn't even binding. He said he had an injury and the ""Office"" at House Doctors was supposed to have called me. NO ONE called me. I did receive a call from the ""owner"" the same afternoon. I told him they really screwed up this deal. He said to tell you that his guy stayed here for an hour and when I called you to tell you that. I would be happy to get a refund for 2 hours since the man who came initially did stay about an hour. I would like a refund."
5,"The carpenter was professional, helpful and pleasant and cleaned up after himself. He also worked steadily, and did not waste time. He called ahead of time to let me know when he was coming."
1,"Unfortunately my experience with House Doctors didn't work well because the specialist came and he couldn't finish the job. First he applied the patches to the hole in our the backyard and he wouldn't paint it because he said that it was too high and then he said if we keep him, then we need to have some kind of contract for a certain job. So I agreed for him to do the job but then the timing didn't work for them so after a couple of months of delay, basically they called me back and they reset an appointment to go the store to buy some wood but then they called me and said that the car was broken and next time they'd call me two or three weeks after. Usually when contractors call you that the car is broken, you can read that they have some other commitments. So I decided not to go to these people and this company. So I'm looking for a new specialist to finish the job. They didn't finish it because they said that the voucher I paid for their job was valid only for one visit. And if I needed a second visit, they said that I should have a new contract with them for some serious repairs and I agreed but, uhm, they replaced the deck but it never worked out because they were delaying and delaying and their car was broken and so I decided that these people are totally unreliable. I would give them an F over-all because they failed to come on time. I asked them also to send me the contract for the service that they needed, if they wanted to do a bigger job, they need to send me the contract. They never sent me any documents to sign. So I think it's a failure, and I think it's really unreliable when they say ""Let's meet"" and the car is broken. That's not the first time when contractors tell you that the car is broken. They always have problems with the car, right? All of them. For me the price was A, I like the price. I have no rating for the quality because the job was never finished."
5,They did some additional work for me too.
5,"The person who came out did a great job. He was on time, friendly, skilled, efficient and professional. He replaced the window sill and painted it. He also caulked and painted parts of a second window and did an excellent job. When I tried to make an appointment, the answering service was disorganized and not very professional. It was difficult to reach a live person. This part of the service needs improvement."
4,Tim was very professional and extremely courteous. After he left I noticed several areas where paint was on the woodwork around doors. I wish he would have taped around them. He did tell me if I found anything to call and he would fix it. I did it myself because I didn't want the paint to dry.
4,Went well other than the service person needed to go purchase additional supplies. Would have thought there should have been an ample amount of patching compound brought.
5,Wainscotting needed to be replace so I had a longer visit and cancelled the special offer. Tim did my work and he is very knowledgeable. The work was reasonably priced. It turned out that I had some mold in one corner and dry wall needed to be replaced also. That was all done and done well.
5,I'm very satisfied with their service
4,"Jim was fantastic! He was polite, fast, skilled, and did an excellent job. The 2 window sills look beautiful. The only problems is getting in touch with the people who do the scheduling. I think they are overwhelmed and don't have a receptionist to take calls. So you have to play phone tag to schedule an appointment. It would help if one could communicate with them via email and schedule an appointment online. I had a coupon, so the price was right."
5,Jim was great! He did a beautiful and efficient job. This only problem is that the office did not call me back promptly. They need to fix this part of the business.
5,"We had a great experience. While the initial estimate appointment had to be changed by one day, we were notified in plenty of time and was not an inconvenience for us. Tim performed the estimate and we agreed to hire The House Doctors for the work. He additionally purchased the supplies needed on that first day as well. We set the day for the work (about a week away), and he and his able helper arrived a couple hours later than scheduled. It was clear that Tim was proficient in all types of home repair. He did electrical and plumbing tasks, carpentry and painting. All were done exactly as we had hoped and the work was done in the amount of time estimated. I would absolutely hire this company again. (Please note that the approximate cost of service includes an Angie's List Deal I purchased for two of the hours of work.)"
4,"They were great. They did a fine job. They were nice guys. They came and did what they said they were going to do efficiently. My interaction with them was fine. He was busy but he got here and did the work. He stayed late to get it done. The work turned out fine. What they did was though they put up the mud, they used a longer setting compound. The problem with that is that's where all the dust come from. I was a little disappointed that they have a $99 deal to repair drywall but they can't stand it which left me to stand it."
5,Appointment was scheduled promptly and work was performed efficiently and with good quality.
5,It went well - did a good job and I purchased a little more time (price given in advance). Would recommend!
5,They replaced the fence post and the fence looks great.
5,"Due to our home remodel running behind schedule, we did not use the deal. I would not hesitate to purchase another deal from the House Doctors in the future. They were prompt to call to schedule our work."
1,"He answered the phone without the name of the business and made it pretty clear, pretty quickly that he wasn't interested in my business probably because the first thing I told him was a small job too far away. Not so great listening skills/customer service. Not sure this company should be listed under ""handymen."" I was so put off by his tone/reaction that I felt the need to put in a review for the next person that might have a smaller job on the west side - I wouldn't bother calling. I am in the real estate business too so who knows what this call could have led to. On a positive note - at least he answered the phone."
1,"AMAZING...at first. They are excellent cleaners. I've no complaints in that regard. But things changed once we left them the glowing Angie's List review. I knew we were a tough assignment -- laundry for a family of four in addition to standard house cleaning -- and I knew Kim and the crew were struggling to find a way to get it done. One moment, they'd tell me they weren't sure it was doable. The next, they'd found a way to make it work and everything was fine. After leaving the review though, it just got more extreme. One moment I was getting angry notes and voice-mails, and when I'd call (which I always did) to ask what I could do to help make the situation better, everything was GREAT again and I was the nicest customer ever. Then, the next week, there'd be another angry note or voicemail. I shouldn't have put up with this, but I didn't want to go through another round of interviewing cleaning companies. I'm a big believer in working problems out and building relationships, and so I kept trying to make this work from my end, even making sure the new washing machine I bought would meet the needs and wants of the cleaning team. And every time, they were satisfied...until they weren't. Finally, I received a long and condescending voicemail, laying out all that was wrong with my house and with the job, informing me they'd taken pictures (I'm sorry--what??) and telling me not to bother calling -- they were done with me and would not change their minds. Look, I get it. Ours was a tough job (tougher than either I or they expected), and, despite their best efforts, they couldn't get it all done. Sure, we had a previous cleaning team that was able to accomplish all of this for less money and had no complaints about our house (nor felt the need to take photographs of our home without our permission as a form of threat???), but whatever. Had we been able to have a real conversation about this, something could have been worked out, but I never had the opportunity. Either things were GREAT or they were TERRIBLE, no room to troubleshoot when things are that bi-polar. If you're looking for a one time clean, I fully endorse these people. Despite my clear frustration with the situation, they are top-notch cleaners who do a thorough job. I give them credit for that and thank them. But they do not have the mettle for long term arrangements. These are not people you can build a relationship with, troubleshoot issues with, or depend upon in the long run. I expect a long reply to this review, laying out everything that was wrong with our house and with the job (which, by the way, felt extremely insulting, hurtful, and threatening in terms of the photographs). Once again, I did all I could to oblige them, was always kind and understanding with concerns expressed, and never once said ""no"" to anything they suggested or asked for. I get that the job, as originally laid out, wasn't one they ultimately felt they could keep up with, despite their best efforts. I wouldn't leave a bad grade for ""We tried, but it just can't work. Sorry."" That's not the issue. The bi-polar nature of these exchanges, the condescending tones, the threat of photographs (???), and the quitting out of nowhere when everything was presumably ""great"" as of our last communication...that's what rubbed me the wrong way and has left me concerned for their future customers."
5,"Very well for the most. Be sure you know that the handyman first assesses the materials needed for the job, then goes to the nearest Lowe's or Home Depot to buy it and you, of course, have to pay for it."
1,I purchased a deal and scheduled an appointment. I called them three or four times and they never called back to let me know if they can perform the service or not.
1,"To use an old movie line "" what we have here is failure to communicate"" Left 3 voice mails, used online scheduling have not heard or seen any type of communication. Will be asking Angie to cancel."
4,"There estimate was extremely high. They were polite and helpful, it was just the price that I found excessive."
2,"I have not heard nor have I received an e-mail with the quotes. I called Mike's cell phone left a message, no return call. I called the office and again left voice mail and no return call."
3,"The guy did a nice job of it, but he took a lot longer. He was putzing around a bit, but he did a nice job for what I needed. So, I was fine with it. I think he could have got it done with the time allotted. There was an additional charge because they said that if it went over the three hours, there is going to be so much an hour. I think there was an extra $60 for another hour. For the $99 considering it was another $60, I guess the price was fine because it went an hour longer and it was a discount to begin with. He was a few hours late. I would probably use them again, but I would stay with them to make sure they keep moving because when he was here, I was at work and my husband was just letting him do his thing out there and I could see when I came home that for what time he got here, he really had not got much done."
2,"I ordered a 'deal' off Angie's List, and was contacted to set up a date to come to do the carpentry work. The appt. was for 7/5/16 between 10 and 12 noon. No one showed. I contacted the scheduler and the office several times and was not able to get any information about the install. I called AL and cancelled the deal and was refunded since it was within 30day window.. Someone did contact me after 1:30 pm but it was too late. That is not acceptable to me. I arranged my day off to accommodate them, they should at least have the ability or the decency to update the customer. UPDATE 1/20/2017: The service providers response is inaccurate, I was home all day and contacted them twice and left messages. I received a voicemail the following day, but had already canceled the deal and received a credit before the call."
5,I liked that they were prompt and they did good work. They knew exactly what they were doing and did a very nice job.
5,"Went well. Prepared and painted entry doors, case molds and baseboards in master bath, guest bath, and laundry room. Cleaned, scrubbed, and power washed all of the garage floor. Replaced and painted 14 deck boards. Replaced 2 mesh kitchen window screens. Previously, had side garage door replaced and painted inside and out. Also, had deck and front steps power washed. House is 17 years old, and looks brand new inside and out."
5,"Mark, the handyman who showed up to perform the work, did a great job. In our area, there is a layer of shale under a few inches of dirt. It was not a easy job, but Mark did it. He made sure the post was straight and was responsive to all of our concerns. I would certainly use this company again."
5,"It went very, very well. We are extremely pleased with the work that was mostly done by Jim. He did an outstanding job."
1,I called 2 week ago to set up appointment the never returned my call. what they are advertising is not true they will call and tell you that they can not do the work. They said they were all booked up I have been calling for three weeks with unanswered phone calls.
4,"When the provider called to schedule an appointment, they were booked for a month in advance. I didn't realize that they would be so busy. I couldn't wait that long so I decided to go with someone else. They worked very hard to try and fit me in but it just didn't work out. They were very sorry for the inconvenience and apologized to me. They seemed very nice and understanding about the whole thing."
5,The service provider was late but provided excellent service when he got here. He did quality work on all of the repairs. I would definitely hire them again.
5,Went well. They cleaned everything we had asked them to do. They also cleaned and put back the accessories on top of the entertainment center.
5,They were wonderful. The work they did was very nice.
1,"I originally purchased a $99 Angie's List Deal for 3 hours for drywall repair. I also expressed that I needed a separate quote to put a ceiling in the basement, since I'm refinishing it. They were supposed to come out on May 3rd, but had to cancel and reschedule. No big deal, that was fine. They weren't able to schedule until May 31. That was somewhat problematic as I had a tenant moving in prior, and wanted the repairs done. But I thought, it's OK. Especially because the lady who answers their phones, Kim, is Such a great lady (super nice and accommodating). That day the person comes out, we go over the job and he starts telling me he'd want to tear apart pretty much the whole 3rd floor for a few bad areas. I expressed that that seemed overkill, and he back pedaled and said that it wouldn't be everything. He said it would be a day and a half, but he could get started with the demolition, since he thought that would take 3 hours. I let him know that A: I thought 3 hours seemed kind of ridiculous for tearing out a couple of smaller sections, and B: I wasn't comfortable having them put holes int he walls and then getting back to me later with the cost of filling the holes and me having NO idea when they'd even schedule that job or anything. I told him I needed a written quote, before ANY additional work could be started. He tried to pressure me into letting him do the work now, because they sold a lof of the coupons and they don't like to reschedule,. I again said he could not put holes in the walls for 3 hours when I didn't know the cost for repairs - nor the schedule. He also tried to tell me the lathe work was bad and that's why some of the plaster was separating. I explained and showed him the lathing was fine, and again expressed it was Clearly from water damage form before the new roof (you could even see discoloration from the water. The owner of the company was supposed to come out later that day to give me a quote for the ceiling in the basement and I was told he'd look at the job and quote it then. I got a call abut 10 minutes later, and was told he talked to the owner and based on his description to the owner, it would take 3 days and cost $1450. He said he'd like to start now. I noted that we suddenly went from a day and a half to 3 days. I told him, he was quoting a bigger project than I had anticipated, and that I wasn't going to have them start anything without an Actual WRITTEN quote. Later that day, I got a call from the owner. He was supposed to come give me the estimates between 1 and 2 pm and I had taken the time out of the office to be there. It was 1:56 pm. he was asking if we could schedule a time for the next day for him to give me a quote. I reminded him that we already had an appointment that was supposed to be right now. He didn't apologize or anything, and simply said ""So, can we do it tomorrow"". I REALLY want to get the plaster repaired and get a quote for the ceiling, so I can get it Done - so I agreed. The next day, he didn't show up. There's been no call, no attempt to reschedule, no apology or acknowledgement. And he isn't answering his cell that he called me from. Suffice it to say, I won't be using them. There were a ton of red flags - from saying the lathes were bad and had to be cut out without even looking at them, to trying to turn a 3 hour $99 plaster repair into a day and half job, to taking the day and a half and trying to turn it into a 3-day $1450 job, to wanting to demolish part of a ceiling and wall without any quote for cost or promise to return. So, if you're thinking about using this company - no. Just, no."
5,"I knew I was a fan of Kim when she first came to the house to give us an estimate. She was personable, friendly, honest, and driven. She has since remained involved as the team assigned to our home has gotten used to the routine, troubleshooting issues when they arose. We had a cleaning team that serviced our home for five years and, when they retired, we were sure we'd never find anyone as good again, but it's safe to say that these folks do it BETTER. Our house hasn't looked this clean since we first moved in, the attention to detail is extraordinary, and Kim truly goes overboard to ensure that the customer is pleased with their work. I've heard of folks going the extra mile, but Kim goes an extra football field to make sure things work out right. The cost per visit is a little outside of our affordability range right now, but Kim is working hard to find ways to get the enormous job that our house entails done in less time so that the cost comes down in the long term. She does this with resourcefulness and determination, and yet never compromises quality in the process. I cannot recommend The House Nurses enough."
3,"First day 3 people came including owner Kim, did kitchen and large pantry. Work looked good. Later on looking closely found that the top of the kitchen cabinets had not been washed. Day two same 3 people came back, cleaned downstairs bathroom and finished work on pantry and kitchen. Day three only Kim came, other two women had previous commitments and could not work. Kim tried to get the livingroom room done by herself but did not get all the work done. One wall needed washing over fireplace and part of another wall. Things were left on mantle, glass ware and. etc. Also other items were in left that had been moved to help her clean. I had washed the curtains but they are still not up. I will have to finish the room myself. I decided to wash the glassware myself plus the mantle. We were charged $325.00 for each day of work, even the final day when Kim worked alone. I think the final day should have been rescheduled to a time when she could have two other workers with her. The work could have been completed. She gave me another appointment for May 25, about one and a half weeks after the livingroom work was begun. The living room was and still is a mess. When it came near their next visit I called to cancel the May 25th appointment. We had been told the days fee would be $265 per day, not $325. We had no written contract,only the price written on the back of their business card. When the price was given for the day they had not mentioned what it would be until they finished for the day. They would only take cash or personal check, luckily I had enough to write a check. As I said, I called and canceled because we had run out of money. I felt that we were being put in to their system where openings were available. I must add that my husband and myself are handicapped. We were told to move things away from the walls. We did the best we could, they were not very specific in what we needed to do. I had hoped to have my home looking good by the first of June so that I could invite people into my house again. It hasn't happened and I am very frustrated. The work they did was OK though spotty. Communication was not good. And the final day should have been rescheduled so that three workers could have taken on the livingroom room and foyer."
5,"Did a good job on everything around the house, that I need fix in the time frame."
5,$109 for 3 Hours of Drywall or Plaster Repair
5,"I was pleasantly surprised when I came home and found the amount of progress made on the first floor, I didn't expect they would get to it at all with the time allotted. I asked my son on the phone how the bathroom looked and he said, ""just like new."" I was in the kitchen and I was trying to figure out why the kitchen seemed so much brighter, I realized the lamp covers were dusted. First, I was in shock over what a difference it made and second, I was impressed that a detail like that was done. I've never had my house cleaned, but after 50-60 hours a week for the last year and half I needed some help catching up. My husband was quite happy as well. The bathrooms did look great. They said they would show up between 9:30 and 10:00 and arrived at just about 10am. Kim called a couple days prior to reconfirm everything. Completely professional company and quality service."
5,Kim and Jesse came out and did 3 hours of house cleaning my house look brand-new better than ever they were very professional on time and went beyond services rendered their extremely polite and I would highly recommend them again to anybody who is looking for a house cleaning services one of my friends from Angie's List referred me to them I would love to give them a page of happiness but cannot find it in this review section to do so I would highly recommend and rehire them for additional services
5,Called to let me know they'd be a bit late (more than fine!) and they did a nice and through job cleaning for first time at my home!
5,Kim came out and did 3 hours of work at my home she was very punctual very courteous and very professional my house looks spotless and shiny it smells very good and she did excellent work she was very efficient and did not stop until the work was done I would definitely use the house nurse again on a job she was referred to me by a friend and did excellent work
1,Employee late rude and not effective tore window shade
4,was kind of nervous at first because I did not receive a follow up call the day before. I did call the morning scheduled and had to leave a message. Handyman called about 30 minutes before. He arrived on time. It took him awhile to figure out one of the shelves because I had lost the instructions and it was partially installed. But the work he completed I was very pleased with. Did a very good job.
5,"Did a wonderful job, was on time and cleaned up after the job was completed"
5,"When we finally made an appointment for reviewing our project the provider called to confirm. Then when their prior appointment changed, they called before coming out earlier than expected. Overall I appreciated their repeated efforts to get and keep in touch. I thought they were very professional and if needed willcontact them again."
5,He was very professional and did a great job.
4,"They worked out fine. They came out and did a few things around my house. They did fine. The person was fine. The one thing that I had a problem with was that the one fixture they changed out had a light bulb that was burnt out, and they had to back and change the bulb. He didn't tell me the light bulb was burnt out. He was a little early which was good. He was very professional. He was very friendly, and I have a dog and he wasn't put off by the dog which is always nice. He was a nice person."
5,Mark arrived on time and was very professional. The repairs look great. The scope of the repairs exceeded the limit of the coupon. We are so pleased with the work that we will be having them come agin to finish up. Thanks
4,Our house door frame was not fixed.
5,"Kim went out of her way to schedule my cleaning for when I wanted it. Kim arrived on time, brought all of her supplies, and got to work right away. I don't think she stopped to rest at all in three hours- she worked tirelessly. My house has not had a thorough cleaning before (so it needed cleaning), and Kim made the rooms look great. Kim worked around all the stuff I still had on my kitchen counter with no hesitation. Kim asked when she had questions, and was very cognizant of making sure I was happy with her work. She made sure she completed what she could and did not try to run out of here when the three hours was up. I would have no second thoughts about hiring her again. She was polite and professional and I am extremely pleased with the experience I had."
3,I paid them $160 for 2 hours of additional labor.
1,After this company never showed up for the scheduled appointment a few years ago I thought I would give them another try since they continue to get decent reviews. Called and made an appointment a few weeks ago and I got stood up for the second time- unbelievable. Called the number I was given when I made the initial appointment after no one showed up and left a message and no call back.
5,"I hired House Nurses to provide a good cleaning to my elderly parents' 2 BR, 2.5 bath condo. I couldn't have been happier with the outcome. Kim arrived on time and dug right in. Over the course of three+ hours, she did a very thorough job in the kitchen and bathrooms, which are the areas where I asked her to focus. She brought her own tools and equipment to do the job. I was very impressed. She did much more than just normal surface cleaning. She got into the corners, nooks, and crannies - on her hands and knees when necessary. Since she gave the kitchen and bathrooms such a good cleaning, hopefully it won't be so tough next time. After the kitchen and bathrooms were done, there wasn't much time to do a couple of the other rooms but Kim stayed a little longer and dusted and vacuumed all around - which my mom really appreciated. I would hire House Nurses again in a heartbeat. My parents plan to use her for regularly monthly cleaning since it's getting too hard for my parents to do it themselves. Kim is a hard worker - no breaks, no messing around - while still being polite and professional."
5,"I purchased the 3 hours of deep house cleaning special. I was at work so I left a detailed note on what I wanted done. Everything was cleaned above and beyond, living room, dining room, kitchen, stairwell, bathroom. I am very happy with the service."
5,"I couldn't be happier with the job, from the consult to the finished product. All the people involved were extremely helpful, courteous, and professional. I told Mike what I kind of wanted done and he knew exactly what I didn't know how to ask for and his staff executed it perfectly. Not once did I have to question or correct what they were doing. I would and in fact am already planning on having them back for some more work at my house."
4,"Went ok, but needs to come back to sand and paint, very difficult getting scheduled"
5,"Kim was very prompt and very friendly. I told her what I had needed done and explained that I have not been in my house for 6 months, I had rented it out. The full bath was pretty dirty with makeup, hair, etc ground in to the floor. The bathtub/shower looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. Kim did a great job getting 99% of the floor clean which is EXTREMELY impressive, it was in BAD shape. She did a good job on the rest of the bathroom as well. She even went so far as removing a window valance (that wasn't mine) which was filthy. Kim asked me if I wanted her to take it downstairs to the laundry. I told her it wasn't mine and she could just throw it out. After finishing the bathroom she came downstairs and asked me what else I wanted done because I still had time left that I paid for. She cleaned the half bath as well and wiped out the inside of my refrigerator. I also want to mention that while Kim was upstairs I cleaned out my refrigerator of all the leftover food containers (left from my renters). I filled up 90% of a large garbage bag that was still sitting in my kitchen when Kim asked if I wanted my refrigerator wiped out. When she was through she asked me if I wanted her to take out that garbage bag. I told her I could get it and she said that's what I'm here for. She promptly tied the bag shut and took it outside to my garbage can...IMPRESSIVE!! Kim did a GREAT job and again, was very personable. THANKS KIM!!!"
5,Replaced an ENTIRE half-bath ceiling (demo/clean/add studs/drywall/three muds) in 4 hours. Agreed to comp him for the 4th hour; he cleaned up and you'd never know he was there. I only had minor mud on the walls to sand down and use touch up paint.
5,"I purchased an Angie's Deal for two hours of handyman labor and am delighted to report that my experience was completely positive. The gentleman arrived on time, completed the tasks, and cleaned up afterwards. He was professional and polite -- I couldn't have asked for more. I will definitely contact The House Doctors for future tasks!"
1,"Angie's List should have a new category for contractors that do not follow-up with homeowners. This seems to be the rule rather than the exception with contractors listed here. This contractor was quick to return my call, sort of quick to come to our house and review the work to be performed, and quick to promise us a write up for an estimate. Unfortunately that was the end of it. No follow-up, no estimate, not a call, not a return call. Do not support this contractor. Interesting. I actually contacted the contractor and advised that we found the location of the leak. I requested that they go to next phase and advise as to what could be done and to provide a cost estimate. I have checked the voice mail logs and caller ID logs. No return call was ever made."
5,She was prompt and thorough. I would use her again.
5,"Such a deal! They were on-time, cleaned up, but did not do finish work. Just so you know what to expect."
5,First time using a house cleaning. Kim was great. She offered suggestions and helped do some organizing on top of just cleaning. House has never looked better. I look forward to her next visit.
5,"They did a fantastic job. It was far, far beyond my expectations, in fact. Everything was picked up, dusted and wiped down throughly, vacuumed, corners and crevices were taken care of, window sills cleaned and more. I'm really happy with the job and would gladly call on them again."
5,The work went very well. The installer was on time and did a professional job with the installation.
5,Kim did an excellent job in both bathrooms. I especially like that she took down the blinds and washed them in the bathtub along with removing grit along the shower tracts. I was very pleased with the job she did on both rooms! Thank you! I will definitely call again in the future...
3,good job.
5,"Easy to arrange schedule. Got a call in the morning from the contractor - uh, oh, worried about the inevitable upsell. But that wasn't the case - he wanted to explain that the baseboard was quite a bit wider than the one I had supplied, and the vertical board had some millwork in it that wouldn't look completely like the regular board I had supplied. He could and did do the work with the materials supplied, he just wanted to let me know there would still be hidden parts of the baseboard that were probably decayed behind the new wood, and that the vertical piece would look a little different than what came down. No ask for an upsell, he just wanted me to know. Very professional. When I got home, the work looked great. I like these guys."
5,"From the person who schedues the appointmets (Kim) to the person who did the work, I could not have asked for more pleasant and professional people. James, I think that was the young man's name, was on time and worked steadily from the time he arrived until he left. He finished the original job I asked for in less than two hours, so he was able to do the additional job of caulking. I have absolutely no complaints!"
5,"After reading the reviews and looking at the deal, I chose The House Doctors for my drywall work and am very happy I did. They were great! Quality work, professional and courteous! The best part, they even cleaned up at the end, taking the time to run a wet cloth over my floors to clean up the dry wall dust! I've had contractors who won't even clean up the scraps and wasted material, let alone any mess they make. I would not hesitate to use them again!"
4,They were fine. There was a little mix-up with the scheduling dates. We had to keep scheduling it. The work was done a month later. The workers were professional.
5,"professional, courteous, cleaned up thoroughly, patched all issues I noted and found some additional issues in need of repair"
5,Very good service. I'm probably going to hire them again this summer.
5,"He was right on time, and he gave me a confirmation call 30 minutes before he arrived as promised. He cleaned up all of the paint scrapings. He was professional and very friendly."
5,Purchased a Big Deal for 3 hours of deep cleaning for $99. Arrived promptly at the scheduled time. Reviewed our list of priorities and quickly got to work. Did not quite finish everything on the list in the allotted time but did a thorough job in the areas that were cleaned. Would certainly consider using this service again.
5,"Service was great! Scheduler was very pleasant and accommodating. Service visit was on time as scheduled. The gentleman that came to do the work was pleasant, knowledgable, and thorough. He finished some molding on the main staircase and built out shelving in a kitchen pantry. His work was done well and he cleaned up after all was finished."
4,This was a big deal purchase. It was alright. They were not able to do what I really needed.
5,"He did a very nice job replacing what he could in the 4 hours of time I purchased through an Angie's List Big Deal. He showed me what problems were created by the need for a new roof - water damage that I did not realize could be a result of the old roof.He was pleasant, helpful, and professional."
5,"When Mike tore out the damaged floor of the corner cabinet under the kitchen sink, he found that the builder, Shore West, had left an open hole under the floor of the cabinet instead of properly ducting it to the register, thereby allowing moisture to accumulate under the cabinet. That is what caused the floor to collapse. He explained how he could fix it properly and offered us the option. After agreeing to everything he explained very well, he went to Home Depot and picked up alternative flooring that would allow for a more finished product and all the other necessary supplies to fix the heating ventilation and plumbing problems under our sink. He spent an additional 2 hours and fixed everything perfectly. He cleaned everything up beautifully and was very personable. It looks amazing and we are so happy we went with his professional expertise and had it done right. He was not pushy at all like many other repairmen we encounter and was very trustworthy."
3,"It did not turn out well. The deal just didn't go as I purchased. I purchased for $99 3 hours of carpentry. First of all they were late but they called to say they were going to be late. When they showed up, they had no information at all about what they were supposed to do. I had an appointment with the House Doctors to have the work done. I don't claim to be smart. They did work but they did not give me credit for 3 hours of any kind of work. I paid almost $800. One of those gentlemen from the company was supposed to call me back. If he called me back, I didn't get the call. I chose the House Doctors because about 8 years or so ago when they came out and they replaced a part in my yard. The first time I used them, they were great and I had no problem. Because part of this was my fault because I was not assertive enough. It was an annoying experience. The owner of House Doctors should have said, What happened here? I paid $850 and I asked about the $99 that I paid for the Angie's List deal. He subtracted that $99 so I paid them $750. I said to myself, it's ridiculous for me to have paid them this much money when I was supposed to have gotten 3 hours of service. I didn't have any problem with the work that they did especially the young men that did my porch. The other thing that surprised me was that they put the stuff in a bag, like the old post, whatever junk was left from the repair, they put them in a bag and put it beside my garage. I am in my 70's and I was supposed to get it to the front, but how? I guess that was my business. I didn't see any evidence of the material because it seemed like they cleaned up so well. My daughter came by and asked what was the bag beside the garage. That had to be thrown away or they should have at least asked me if I have a way of getting it away from here. I think he did a good job on the porch. Just the haphazardness of the way they showed up and absolutely had nothing. I believe that the Angie's List deal that I had purchased is because of the appointment and the time and the people's names that were used when I made the appointment. One of those guys went out to Home Depot to purchase everything that they needed. I paid for everything out of my pocket. I have talked about having them do 3 doors. They told me the price for that would be $900. I said they were crazy. I am going to purchase the door and it's going to cost me somewhere in the area of $900 for them to put them in. That was what one of the gentlemen was supposed to call me back and talk to me about. That is not going to happen."
3,"I thought the price was a lot when I saw the finished product. I was expecting them to do a wood restoration that would make the wood look good and the wood did not look good. It does not look good. I know it was sanded down and all that. But, it does not look good. He explained that he did what he could with it. They could have been more responsive to my phone calls."
5,One time and did a good job.
4,"The guys brought out the compound and spackling. What happened was when he got to my mother's house he had some spackling but not enough to do the complete job. What he had on his truck was enough to do only one coat. He told us that after everything dries we'd need to sand it and do a second and maybe a third coat and then it'll be ready for painting. I would like for them to come out, sand, and put on the remaining coats and get it ready so that we can paint it. What he's done so far is good, it's just incomplete. My grades are provided that they come and finish the job."
3,"Called the day before. Changed time to 9 am was 930 Said it would be 2 people only one showed. I saw that the person had called at nine. So when I called her back she stated I'm on the way .Do you have a mop. Got to my house after 940. Started her timer. Only washed down my cabinets in a small L shaped kitchen, My cabinets did have grease on them but not 3 hours worth. And she used my products and did not placed them back where she got them from."
5,"They came in, we walked through what I wanted done, prioritized the room needs and then proceeded to do exactly what I needed. They were wonderful, professional and very nice. Everything was professionally handled and they treated the house as they would their own. Thanks!"
5,"Provider was unable to come on original date due to staff illness. She agreed to do job herself the next day. She arrived promptly with one helper. They got started right away and worked very hard. They swept and mopped, cleaned tub and shower, wiped down cabinets and counters, stove and refrigerator."
1,"I used the Angie's List service to purchase a coupon for $99 of drywall work (sucker!) from The House Doctors back in January of 2015. I provided all of the information and provided 3 suggested dates for the work. Here is the note I attached to the job, just to give the reader an idea of the scope of the work: ""Several wall and ceiling areas need this service, including one large area in the ceiling over the landing on the stairs. I will most likely purchase more time to ensure everything gets done. Thanks!"" Here's what happened: -The response, immediately via Angie's List (left out the names and phone numbers, etc): ""Hi xxxxxx. Please send your phone number to xxxxxx@xxxx.com or call Michael xxxxx at xxx-xxx-xxxx to get scheduled. Thanks, Bob xxxxx"" - I emailed Bob promptly and gave him 2 phone numbers where he could attempt to reach me, and I received a quick response that day that they would be in touch. - With no guarantee of when they would contact me for scheduling, I contacted Bob again via email 2 days later. - Another immediate response, this time to say I would be contacted that day or the next, or that i could call Michael if I needed faster scheduling. ""Today or tomorrow"" sounded perfectly fine, so I waited.... Then I called Michael at the number provided and left a message with my name and phone number. - 4 weeks later, I decided to send another message, this time via Angie's List. I included photos of the work I needed done, and let them know I would call Michael that day, which I did, and left another message. - The response, immediately via Angie's List: ""Hi xxxxxx. We can certainly help you out with your drywall project. Please send your phone number to xxxxxx@xxxx.com or leave a message for Michael at xxx-xxx-xxxx and he will schedule your work. Thanks, Bob xxxxx"" - I responded via Angie's List that the person on the other end of the email they provided (Bob?) had my phone number for weeks already, but that I would attempt to call Michael again as soon as I had time. Which I did, and left a message... - Some time went by and I hired another business to complete the work. I can only assume that they were not interested in the business of someone who had pre-paid for a small amount of labor, even though the job would have guaranteed them far more money. The pictures I provided clearly show I needed more than $99 of labor, but they didn't bother to even provide a quote. I guess business was booming. Needless to say, I will not be hiring them for any of the many other jobs I need completed, nor will I recommend them to others. Not that they seem to need it."
5,"The gentleman came out and did everything we asked him to do with a smile. We replaced the thresholds on the front and back doors, they were rotted and and needed reinforcement. He did everything the way it should be done and didn't cut corners. A very hard worker."
4,They did very well taking them down so i could paint them. Then they rehung them up for me. It went very well for everything...
5,Wonderfully professional. Very courteous. Took the time to learn what was my highest priority and accommodated my preference. Checked in to make sure they were meeting my needs. Very efficient. I would absolutely recommend these house cleaners.
5,"Had had House Doctors do some fence repairs earlier this year and was very pleased. Bought the three hour big deal and left message. Company returned call next day and set up appointment for a couple of weeks out. I called back discovering that I had a repair due date to meet--and responded to best ,meet my needs. I purchased the lumber. Carpenter came on time and seemed to do a very good job on fence repairs. He worked the full three hours, was friendly and cleaned up old materials, bring them to the tree lawn for pickup. I knocked him down to ""B"" on professionalism because he didn't seem to have all the tools etc with him to do fence work. Overall very good experience."
5,"I had three areas of damage to my home's ceilings from plumbing leaks. I have been trying to get someone to repair this for a long time. It needed to have the taping removed for a large area in the kitchen and i was afraid the stippling would not match. My home is 26 years old. He did a fantastic job of repairing it and it is hardly noticeable. Since the builder did not ever paint the ceiling, I was able to just leave the repair as it is and don't even have to paint it. It blends right in. He was courteous and professional and went above and beyond to complete my work. I used the Big Deal and paid a little extra for the extra time he had to spend while the plaster cured."
2,My initial coupon was for 3 hours. I have 2 areas on ceilings that needed repair. One had the drywall already pieces in. The other needed a 2x2 piece pieced. They arrived late and had 2 guys. One guy did virtually nothing. The other did all the work which was not a lot. In 1.5 hours the coupon was used up because they arrived with 2 people. I needed a return trip because one of the areas needed to dry. I get that. I placed calls to schedule a return. No calls back. Very poor customer service.
5,"I gave a B for quality, not because of the work, but because i had to buy a 2nd coupon to finish the job"
5,"The provider was prompt, courteous, and professional. She had all of her own tools and cleaning products. The provider explained what she was going to do and she did it. The rooms smell fresh and clean. The kitchen floor has never been cleaner. While not perfect, the provider put in two hours of work on the rooms and her efforts show."
5,Ordered the Angie's List Big Deal for $79. Emailed company. Kim emailed and called within 48 hours to set appt. Kim came on time. Cleaned as indicated. Very polite and professional.
1,"After a week, I still hadn't received an estimate so I called and left a message informing him that I had not received an estimate. I again gave my phone number and email address thinking maybe he lost it. After not hearing anything after my call for another 3 days, I left another message asking for the estimate. The next day I received a call from a woman at the business stating that the owner was out of town for a couple days and that I could expect to hear something on Monday. Well it is now Thursday and have still not been contacted. Not a very responsive business. Company states in their response that they emailed an estimate twice. This is completely untrue. After I originally did not hear from them, I left a voice mail message stating my email address AGAIN. I never received ANY email. In addition, their was never any attempt to call me after they said they would. Their response appears to be a canned response similar to another poor rating on October 8, 2015. I just updated my rating to an F for professionalism as well due to unethical response."
5,They came out and they were very good. We had our ceiling fans up and we took them down.
5,"The first time I called them, it was late September 2015. I called on a weekend to leave a message. Bob Vecchio returned my call in less than 5 minutes. He said, ""not to worry"" and ""plenty of time left to repair porch before it gets too cold to paint."" His son Mike met with me on October 8 to give me an estimate for the work. He was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. He explained in detail what they would do. The estimate arrived about two days later via email. The price seemed very fair. Work started on October 26. Jim came on time and worked very efficiently. It was clear to me that he was quite comfortable with porches. He tore open the porch to check what was going on underneath. Mike came out to inspect too and he advised me on the additional work needed to reinforce the joists. He had told me ahead of time that there would be additional costs for the joists but it would ""not be thousands of dollars."" It turned out to be about $800 which I understood. Jim worked alone and finished the entire job in two days. Pretty amazing given he had to reinforce ALL of the joists, correct what the previous contractors had done and replaced 80% of the tongue and groove boards. Mike came out two times to follow up and to make sure I was happy. I'm a graphic designer and I'll be honest, I'm very particular about work in our house being done neatly and correctly. I am not exactly easy to please. Jim is an excellent carpenter. He is very quiet, professional and neat. This is the second time he has done work at our house. The first experience was a side door installation and that went very well too. The porch looks fantastic and it appears to be very solid. The wood came primed, so my husband stained it a few days later. It's in tip-top shape for the winter now! Thank you, House Doctors!"
5,Showed up on time & didn't stop until job was complete...
5,"The old ball and chain decided to place a doorway between our living room and dining room for quiet and privacy while watching TV. I hated the door because it made the house seem smaller. After several years of complaining he took it down but procrastinated about rebuilding the doorway frame. When I saw the deal for The House Doctor I jumped on it. Mike arrived on time, was very professional and did not leave a mess."
2,"Two young man came on time. Pleasant and receptive. The work was to repair bottom of door frame and loose door sill. 1. He and his assistant started to cut out rotten part of the frame and part of sub floor. They needed to fill the gap. They cut 1x4 and painted one piece and did not paint the other piece. Made 2 pieces rather than one. Attached to floor joist with glue and screws. They could not put back door sill because there is no sub floor. They had to put screws to metal part of the door sill to anchor it. It is not very stable. 2. To repair bottom of door frame, they cut out rotten part of the frame. They put pieces of wood to replace cut out part of door frame. Pieces of wood did not fit well, they needed many trial and error to make it fit. The finish is not even, part of the replaced wood is sticking out. 3. They cracked inside of door frame while doing the work, for which they put caulk and a screw to avoid separation. 4. They did not buy correct weather sseal for bottom of the door, had to buy another one which I paid again. They had to make another trip to the Home depot, which took another 25 minutes (First trip to Home depot was to buy 1x4 wood and weather seal). Next day, I had to remove and make it fit because metal part was deforming weather strip. 5. While removing the door to replace weather strip they made 2 ugly gouges to inside door frame. 6. They did not have tarp to protect my newly installed wood floor. The men worked as much as they know how to do it. I do not blame them. I have problem with The house doctor. They should have sent skilled person to do the job. They sent inexperienced workers. Due to the trial and error it took much longer to do the job and caused some damages to the door frame. It took total 8.5 man hour and I had to pay $195 extra. The Angie's list coupon was $111 for 3 hour. I have hired a lot of contractors from Angie's list. This is first time I am reporting because Angie's list members should know about the company."
5,The problem we had...no hot water...is gone and we are very pleased.
5,Nice job - very polite - would use again.
4,"It went fairly well, however, it cost me more money. One of the helper's was not as professional, I would use them again but request a different person to help."
4,"This was an Angie's List deal and scheduling with this provider was difficult. When the person would call and leave a message for me to call her to schedule, I would quickly return her call, and had to call and leave a message more than once just to get someone to call. To be honest, after all the attempts I can't remember the exact date when I was finally able to get the work done. When the two young men came out, they were punctual and professional. And the work was satisfactory. I had to pay extra to get the drywall in the condition it really needed to be. And for them to sand and paint would have cost $50-65 more. That did not seem like a good deal to me. The area was not that large. I'm not sure I would use them in the future, but if I did, it will not be with an Angie's Special. I would instead get a quote for the entire job first. Also, the date that I have entered may not be the correct date the work was done, so i apologize to the vendor. I do not have access to my files right now to retrieve the invoice, and I had to enter a date in order to complete the review."
4,"I think it was $99 for four hours. They did good work but I had to figure out a way to get it painted. They did good work but they did not finish it. I don't have a ladder tall enough so I think although they were actually doing work, it kind of caused me to do more work. I would have been nice if they had offered a solution to have it finished. They were there longer than the deal was for, which was fine, but I felt like that pricing was a little bit high. The quality of work seemed good, but they just didn't finish or offer a way to finish it."
1,"Before making the purchase of the Big Deal for plaster repair, I sent a message to the company through Angie's List briefly explaining the type and size of the repair in the ceiling plaster. I also said the property was in Lakewood and I asked if they were registered to work in Lakewood. I received a message back that they could help me with the repair and they could work in Lakewood. Based upon this information, I purchased the Big Deal. I got a call from someone at the company wanting to set up a date for the repair. This is a rental property and I had to clear the work with the tenant. When that was set, I called the company back to set up the date. After a week, I got a call back and the time was set for July 14, with their worker to arrive between 10:00 - 11:30 a.m. On the day of the appointment, I was at the property at 10 am and waited. At 11:30 exactly, the worker showed up. We went to the room and he looked at the area and said it could not be repaired and the entire ceiling would have to be replaced at a cost of approximately $1,000. I said that was not an option and we left. But I was not surprised by this situation because I felt that this company was very unprofessional from the beginning. First of all, it was obvious that they never read my messages about the problem because they kept asking me for my phone number which I provided in the messages. Secondly, they never asked for any detailed information about the problem, photos or anything. Because they don't go to the site to evaluate the problem, I believe they are really unprepared to take care of anything except small issues. I also want to note that this company is not on the Lakewood Building Department's list of registered contractors, as I was lead to believe by the company. Strangely enough, the day after the appointment, I had a call from a lady at The House Doctors checking to see if an appointment had ever been made to come to my property. I laughed and said, yes, yesterday was the appointment. She apologized for not knowing but indicated she was ""trying to get them organized"" or something to that effect. I said someone had been to the property but I did not have the work done. I would strongly recommend that members be wary of this company and if you contract for them to do any work, make sure they are able to do it before you do anything with them. And since then, I have talked to other plaster contractors and they all indicated the ceiling could be repaired. I have since had the repair made for much less than $1,000"
5,The job was done professionally in a timely manner and they were happy to work around scheduling constraints. Mark communicated with me throughout the job with updates and timelines and they were able to finish this large job quickly. I would definitely hire them again.
1,I tried reaching the contractor four time. He never returned any of my calls. I tried over a period of two weeks. Very unprofessional
3,"It was okay. First of all, it said, ""$99 for three hours of work."" However, they don't tell you that they would bring two people out and that it's split. So, basically it was an hour and a half for $99, with two guys and it also includes them going to get the material. So, that took us 45 minutes. So basically, we paid $99 for 45 minutes. It took them, in addition, three hours to complete the project. So, I don't think I would use them again. It was cheaper than if you got a carpenter to do it. But, another thing; halfway through it, he was committed to another project. So he had to leave. I said, ""Wait a minute. You've got half of it done. When can you come back?"" He said, ""Oh, I don't know. You'll have to speak to my boss and draw up a schedule."" I said, ""No. That's not right. You're half done here. You don't leave this job to go to another job,"" which he did. But I begged him and he came back Saturday and finished it up. But, he was rushing through it. So, he didn't do it the way he should have done it. So, most likely, I won't use them again. The price was pretty decent. It was $400 to rebuild a wall. But, the whole thing was just not handled properly. I think saying, ""$99 for three hours of work,"" you should put in there that they're bringing two people and then that split up and then also that you have to pay to go get the materials. What I had to do was, drive with them and go pay for the materials. That took us 45 minutes. So, basically we're paying $99 for 45 minutes work, which was nothing more than tearing the old stuff off. The work was decent. He is just a handyman but he really tried his best. I think these guys are under the gun and they overbook them. That's what he said to me. He said, ""When they put out these specials, we're running around mad."" He said, ""I feel bad. I was rushing to get it done under the time. I didn't do it how I wanted to do it."" So, he even mentioned that he was stressed out. Another thing was, they don't take any of the trash. I had four or five bags of stuff that I had to carry out myself to the trash the following Tuesday. So they don't take any of that with them either. The guy was pretty decent and mannerly. I watched him the whole time. He wasn't snarky about that."
5,I provided a plywood sheet and the screws. They cut the plywood and installed it were I wanted. They were on time and professional. Overall a good transaction.
3,"I spoke with someone at the shop ahead of time to make sure they clearly understood what the job was and whether they would need any additional supplies, etc. I told her I had this same thing done in a different room of the house that was approximately the same size and it took 2 guys --- non-professionals --- only about 2 or 3 hours to complete the entire project. The woman was very pleasant and said they had all the info and supplies they needed and just wanted to confirm the time. The day of the scheduled appointment, one carpenter showed up. It became obvious within a matter of seconds that he was told nothing about the job and had no idea what he was hired to do. After I explained what I wanted done --- vinyl plank flooring installed in one small-ish room --- the first words out of his mouth were, ""I hate installing these things."" The second thing out of his mouth was, ""There is no way I can finish this in one day. This is going to take at least 2 days to complete it."" I was not off to a good start. Long story short, he did wind up completing the job in one day. It took about 7 hours, so it wasn't cheap. And after the rocky start, the carpenter did loosen up and was very nice. He also worked very hard to get the project completely in one day. As far as the results, he did a very nice job fitting the planks together evenly and correctly, and at a glance the flooring looks very nice. However, he did a very shoddy job around the corners and edges of all doorways, stairs, and fireplace. He did not remove the bottom trim of the baseboards in order to slide the planks underneath them, resting 5/16th of an inch from the wall like you are supposed to. I also made sure the representative I spoke with on the phone understood this and she said it would be no problem. So after this, I had to hire a separate carpenter to come and replace all the baseboards and trim, because the uneven and jagged edges of the flooring butting up against the wall looked awful. And since then, I've still been using brown calking, paint, and pieces of floor transitions in attempt to hide all the mistakes and gaping holes around the fireplace and entryway. Bottom line is you get what you pay for. I found the ""best"" (i.e. cheapest) deal on Angie's List, and the job was completed in one day. I wasn't expecting a miracle worker, nor did I get one. Next time tough I'll gladly pay an extra couple hundred bucks to do a better job. I still can't get over the fact that I had 2 non-professional guys install the same flooring in another room that was approximately the same size, and they finished it in 2-3 hours and it looks immaculate, yet it took this service an entire working day to simply finish it and the quality wasn't even half as good. Oh well... You get what you pay for."
4,"When the representative called me to set up the service, I realized that I hadn't understood the details of the deal and it was not going to work for us -- timing and the need to purchase our own materials made it not as appealing to us. I received a refund from Angie's List. The House Doctors were courteous and helpful as I realized this wasn't going to work for us at this time."
3,I called them and the problem was not rectified. They said someone would come out and no one did.
5,"Great job!!! The house is old and the front porch needed repairs. Several pieces has rotted, cracked, and broke off. The new wood was cut evenly and placed in sturdy, interlocking pieces. I was amazed that as much of the porch was able to be repaired within the time frame of 3 hours. I will definitely have more work done on the porch. The carpenter was professional, polite, and did a great job. Thank you House Doctors.......I highly recommend you!"
5,"Mark was prompt, very polite, and cleaned up after the job"
1,I called the company and left a message. A woman called back the next day and set up an appointment for the following week on Friday (9/11/2015) between 1:00 and 3:00. I stayed home Friday afternoon waiting for the person to come. At 5:00 I called the company and left a message that no one showed up for the appointment. This is Monday afternoon and still no contact. I wasted half a day waiting for the contractor to show up!
3,Not as expected
5,"The painters came for parts of several days and worked steadily even on some hot days. At the last minute, my husband asked them to do another window and the trim on the corner (which he thought we had requested earlier). They had to come back another day to finish up. The men were very professional and polite and friendly. It is nice to have all of these jobs done."
5,On time (within a set 2 hour window). Did the job. Will need to come back to complete the ceiling repairs though. The mud needed additional time to dry before it was ready to retexture. I will hire again.
3,hired to power wash home. they contact you via email and give you a telephone number to call to make appointment. the number is completely unmanned and getting in contact with them was extremely difficult and when I did they notified me they were booking months out...................
5,"Mark was amazing. He was so conscientious and professional I thought for sure he was the owner (he is not). When the job was completed quickly he offered to paint the area he repaired!! So grateful, otherwise I am sure the wall would not have been painted for weeks! Scheduling was a ""pain"" but now I know it was so worth it. Kim, the scheduler, was a delight."
5,"They responded to my appointment request promptly, showed up on time and completed the work in an efficient and professional manner. I would hire them again to perform other work at my home."
4,"I bought the 3 hrs of service thru Angie's List, but didn't need 3 hrs of work--just wanted to get the job done ASAP. The contractor was prompt, personable and worked efficiently. I had removed water damaged baseboards, drywall, and wallpaper well away from the repair area, but the repair guy extended the drywall mud onto areas that still had wallpaper--making it difficult for me to sand and prep the whole section for new wallpaper. He cut new baseboards using the previous baseboard pieces to match, but they were more than 1/4"" off when I went to reinstall them. So I took the original pieces to a lumberyard and had new pieces cut to the same angles. Guess what? The lumberyard also cut them incorrectly. I finally trimmed them myself with a miter box and undercut by 1/8"" -- and filled the gap w/caulk. Contractor did a nice job caulking shower stall -- clean and professional looking and very quick. Overall, responsive service and a good price, but medium quality. Like many handymen, they know what they're doing, but you still need to direct and inspect so you don't end up with additional tasks."
4,Don't remember details (it's been 2+years since service).
5,I bought a $100 coupon for 3 hours of drywall work from 1 Drywaller. Instead of 1 guy 2 showed up and completed the work in a little over an hour. Initially I was charged a full hour for the work going about 10 minutes past the hour. I notified the Secretary that although I paid I didn't think I should be charged the full amount of $85 extra. The company owner learned of this and was good enough to return my $85 which I think is very professional. The work and price were great. No complaints. Would recommend. Tom
5,"On time. Professional, courteous. I would use again and highly recommend,"
1,Purchased Certificate online and could not get a hold of company for over four weeks. Called Angieslist and they cancelled the purchase (approximate cost of service: $99.00)
5,They did an excellent job and even did the stucco. I would use them again.
4,"They did a great job of quickly repairing the damage. They put down drop clothes and swept up the area pretty well. I think they did a great job. However, it took the company a week or more to get back with me to schedule an appointment."
5,Mike came this morning and I showed him what work needed to be done. He got right to work and was very skilled. I am very impressed with the work he did. It's not even noticeable that there was a huge hole in my wall! I have used The House Doctors before and will definitely use them again.
5,"Responded on time, and came with an assistant. Appointment delayed a half-hour and kept. Worked hard and completed by afternoon. Repaired and replaced several posts and a number of pickets. Worked hard to keep my materials cost down, and cleaned up well. Highly recommend."
5,"Job was partially completed as Deal was for three hours and tech was at end of day. Very neat, thorough, and informative tech. Waiting for an estimate to complete repairs."
1,"The worker showed up, my wife explained that we wanted the walls in the garage repaired, he said that the cracks would likely return despite his work. That's all fine, but he ignored most of the walls and was not here for anywhere close to three hours. The parts he did were fair at best. This deal was a total waste."
5,"Excellent work timely, cleaned up courteous very professional!"
5,I needed to call as the prior scheduler failed to follow-through. When I explained the situation the new scheduler was very responsive and the technician who performed the work was diligent. I would use them again
4,"Went well....it was a deal from angies list....my only complaint was that I took the deal on May 5th, but the earliest they could complete the service was June 25th or so. Long time to wait for service to be preformed."
1,"I shopped a coupon from Angie's list for $99 for three hours of general carpentry work. I thought that it would be good enough to put on a single wood panel on the exterior wall and repair a small area of deck. I waited one week before a lady called me to schedule a time. She told me that I had to get all the materials ready myself. After two more weeks, a guy showed up with a compact car. He apparently did not even have a ladder to do the work. Instead, he tried to give you a lot of reasons that much more work would be needed and came up with a cost estimate in the amount of $2000. This is a scam. I would never recommend to buy any coupon from this company."
3,"I had great difficulty scheduling as House Doctors did not respond to my repeated phone calls or emails. IJob was originally scheduled for June 11, and after waiting for hours, it was finally cancelled due to earlier job taking too long. Rescheduling was again very difficult. I would have cancelled but it was now past 30 days so I contacted Angies List for help. After my call to An gies List I heard back from House Doctors quickly and scheduled job for several weeks later.,as there were only 2 dates available. Job itself was done well, quickly and efficiently."
2,"There was no initial contact for months because they were very hard to reach. After several phone calls and emails someone finally called back and said they could not give me a service date because they had so many customers respond to the deal. So, I patiently waited several months for them to contact me which they never did so I contacted them again. I finally reached the owner who said he was going on vacation and to talk to his son. I reached the son who gave me another number to call to talk to another guy. At that point I no longer had any interest in their services because I felt they were totally unorganized and overbooked."
1,"They didn't provide any services. I got a refund from Angie's List. After I bought the deal, I spoke with people over and they said that they would come the first day to make an estimate and let us know what would be involved in the project and then they would come back and add in the hours that we had purchased plus any additional time plus materials. That sounded all very good. Then when they came over, seven weeks later, because that was the first time that they were available to come over, the guy came with an assignment to do the job and asked me if I had all of the materials. I didn't know what the job entailed and I didn't know what materials were needed. He then told me that the time that he was there right then was part of the time that we had purchased. I said that there had been some kind of mistake. Then I spoke with his manager and we decided that it would be in both of our best interest just to cancel the deal. That's what we did. There was no way that I was going to be able to trust them to do the work after there was such a misunderstanding. I made that very clear to them that I did not want them to do the work if this is how they were going to work with me. He claimed that it was a misunderstanding and I still didn't want them. Now, I'm sitting here with the work still needing to be done and I need to find someone to do it."
3,"The service person arrived on time but seemed surprised that my cracks could not easily filled with spackling compound but needed to be taped and covered with drywall compound. The first 30 minutes was wasted on him lecturing on what he could do and not do. Finally, I asked him to do the best he could when repairing the cracks. My reason for having him repair the cracks was to see if that would solve my problem or if they would just reappear. I also was being lazy as I could have done it but thought it would be easier to have someone else do it. Once he started he did an okay job that the cracks will need to be sanded and another coat of dry wall compound will be required. I had hope that is first coat have been smoother then what I could have done so extra sanding would be minimum. He also did not tape all of the crack so those cracks reappeared. Lastly, I thought he over charged me for the additional supplies he used but I thought it would be useless to argue with him."
5,Would use again. Very courteous.
5,Excellent. Michael was the most professional worker that I have ever experienced. He was so polite and did an A plus job on my driveway.He asked to use my bathroom and as you can imagine his feet were wet .I saw him clean up my bathroom floor. The driveway and sidewalks look great. I will definitely use The House Soctors again.
1,"The company gave me estimates for replacement of areas, but doesn't repair lathe and plaster ceilings.. How can I get a refund of $198.00."
2,I wouldn't bother trying to work with them if you value your own time.
1,"I paid for the ""Deal"" (3hours of plaster work for $99) on June 23 ,2015 order #2082155. I selected a day June 24, 2015 for service and mentioned I am available almost any day. No one came on June 24. House Doctors asked for my phone number on June 23, 2015 and I sent the information on June 24. I wasn't able to contact House Doctors. During the period from June 23, 2015 through September 3, 2015 I contacted Angie's List about this problem at least four times. Finally after 2 months an appointment to do the work was made for August 26, 2015, 10-12AM. Two workers came to my house, Mark and a assistant. They said they didn't have time to do the job. They did tell me that the dry wall job would cost an additional $475. To paint the interior of my house they said the cost would be $2300 and I would have to pay for the paint. Mark said they would clear this price with their boss and email me a contract. They left, no drywall work completed. After contacting Angie's list again I did hear from the House Doctors secretary on September 2, 2015. She asked me to repeat most of the details of my dealing with House Doctors. I repeated most of the details stated above. No appointment was made to do the work. On September 3 2015 I contacted Angie's List to ask for a refund and cancel my ""Deal"" with House Doctors. Jon was very helpful and also renewed my membership. My ratings above reflect my true feelings about this ""Deal"". This Company might do good work. After waiting more than 60 days nothing has been accomplished at my house. Without Angie's list I would have had no contact with this Company"
1,"I bought 3 hours of drywall/plaster repair about 3 weeks ago. I have called & emailed repeatedly. I got one email response, asking for my contact info which I had provided multiple times. I'm working on getting a refund. I would not use these people. Very poor customer service."
5,"The crew removed all of the 45 year old, broken, and crumbling concrete in a very quick fashion, and cleaned up the debris very nicely. Next, the crew replace the entire garage floor, the big patio, and the entrance foyer, and custom-stamped the foyer and patio to look like natural stone surfaces. After the garage, patio, and foyer cured, the crew quickly did the entire driveway, and within a few days we were able to use all of the new surfaces with no problems. After the concrete cured, the crew returned and sealed all of the new surfaces to ensure long life and good looks. Very good experience."
4,"They did a good job at power washing. Only complaint I have is they don't call you back. I left 4 messages with in 5 days and never got a call. Disappointed in the time frame for them to come out, as well as they didn't call for a week once I bought the coupon. I wish they would at least call people back. Otherwise the deck looked good."
5,Showed up with two guys. One was an expert one was younger. They worked well together. They got all of the things done I needed. I will have them back to do more work.
1,they charged me and never did the work ignoring my calls BUYERS BEWARE
5,Showed up on time. Surveyed the job. Went out and obtained supplies and promptly returned and completed the job.
5,Good communication and really nice people.
1,HE never came. His office said that he was very busy.
5,went very well. very professional. carpenter was professional and hard working. also provided information on another job.
4,"The job itself went great, and they did a few other things. They were clean, professional and did a wonderful job. They told me that the texture wouldn't be the same as the rest of the ceiling. The ceiling dried and it was flat with little texture. A few months later someone else came to look at it and remarked that it wasn't a great job and that they should make it better. I called them back to say it needed to be re-textured. Mike the owner said they'd schedule someone for Memorial Day - I called them back and asked them if they wanted to schedule on a holiday. They didn't so they had to reschedule. They never called me back - I called them again, they didn?t call me back. I tried calling the owner and he said he would schedule it himself. I never heard from them since. I was going to use them for a number of projects and they haven?t been very responsive. However if they would like to respond to this issue I would love for them to complete the work."
4,"It went well. the only reason I had this service provided was two fold, one he was offering a special for xx hours of work, and second I was recoving from surgery from cancer. I am a handy man around the house, and have all the tools....it's just hard to reach up when you have 70 stiches...."
5,"Had hole / crumbling ceiling between 1st and 2nd level. Eric came in, cut out the hole, examined it and identify where the leak was coming from (toilet on 2nd floor, I had already fixed it). He talked me through everything that had happened, what to expect and what he would do. He then repaired the hole, added additional security to the ceiling where it was loose, and added texture that looked identical to the rest of the kitchen. He did an amazing job, got it done in less than 3 hours and went above and beyond to educate me and talk through things. Because of his excellent work, I will call these guys again for future jobs. Thank you Eric!"
5,"Jim arrived within the allotted time-frame. He was pleasant/professional & from start-to-finish was 3 hours & 15 minutes. He stated the front door trim wasn't rotted, but the crumbling side door threshold was obviously in need of replacement. Jim took a loose paint-chip from the side door trim to the nearby Sherwin Williams to match (wish he'd had done the same from the front door & side door's threshold which need painting) & also to Home Depot for a 2x8x8 + a 2x4x8 pressure treated wood, caulk & other supplies. Jim declined my offer to assist. Pros: He removed the side door storm/screen, rotted threshold & small portions of the door jamb. He fashioned new door jamb pieces & the threshold from the 2x8, caulked everything & re-installed the storm/screen He caulked the bottoms of the front door trim & looks like he applied a light coat of wood filler to the dried/cracked trim (though I had to buy more wood filler to complete the pre-painting prep). The 2x4x8 was used to replace rotted/horizontal spacers & then reattach 2 fence slats. He also reattached 2 other fence slats. He used screws I offered/supplied. He cleaned-up most of the debris. He verbally said the materials cost $55.00, which I paid him in cash. Cons: Seems the side door's threshold is lower than the original as the storm/screen door doesn't ""seal"" at the bottom when closed - which I didn't discover until after he left. I completed cleaning/swept his work-area of sawdust from the driveway. I had asked for the Sherwin-Williams & Home Depot receipts for my records & though replied ""No"" when he asked if I wanted change from the $55.00, after he left I realized he bought screws for the job. The receipts totaled $47.89 & he didn't leave the screws he bought for the job. Bottom line is I'm happy the threshold's been replaced so commenting (above) just for the record/review."
1,Very unprofessional not to even call
5,It went well - Mark called to notify us that he was on the way. When he got here - he took care to lay down plastic to protect the floors from the plaster. He spent a good deal of time working the mud to get it just right - and we are very excited to finally have that area finished and ready for paint. Very professional and courteous - great job Mark. The only reason I gave a B on responsiveness was because when the service was scheduled the service rep did not explain to me that I should have joint compound here for Mark to use - would have been good to know in advance of the work. Otherwise - very pleased with the service.
3,They got about half the taping competed that I would have expected to be done.
5,"repaired a problem i was having on my roof which was causing damage to a ceiling, took out and replaced part of the ceiling"
1,I called last week and still no return call.
1,I have called them 7 times with no response back. I will never do business again.
5,That's what he did and it was a big deal purchase.
1,They are very difficult to get hold of.
5,"They did a real nice job in our kitchen. Painted, cleaned and it's really nice."
3,"They missed the first appointment by an hour and called to reschedule. When they came, it was two fellows for 1 1/2 hours as opposed to a workman for 3 hours as the Big Deal said. The work I needed done did not require 2 men. The work they did cracked badly by the next day. I was told by the next contractor I hired to repair it, that the 'mud' was put on too thickly. I will NOT call them again."
2,They don't have any openings until July I wanted the service done sooner then that.
5,It turned out well. He did good work and cleaned-up after themselves well. They're very versatile company that offers several different services. I've used them for several different things. They've always done good work.
5,"The jobs went very well. They replaced 4 window sills and a 3 sided bay window sill that had rotted. They also took out the bottom six or more inches of the boards going up the side of the window sill. The first day they only did the bottom of the sills and when I took pictures and asked why the sides where not replaced as discussed during the initial walk through they just hadn't gotten to that part of job. It was nice that they didn't try to back track from the walk through explanation of what was included in the quote or that they didn't get defensive with my questions. Just gave a quick explanation and we all moved forward. The sills were all caulked into placed I am very happy with the finished product. The rotted/broken wood siding they replaced looks great as well. Very happy. The floor joist in the basement is also very secure now. during the walkthrough it was explained that they would try to sister a board from beam to beam. Due to the all the extra clutter in the basement (it is 145 year old house) there was no way to effectively secure the new sister to the beam without removing wiring/other boards/ductwork/plumbing. They put a 6 foot board on each side of the broken joist and secured to one beam and the joist. The repair looks very secure and I am happy with the work. Once again, I called with questions because at fist the end result did not look like what I was expecting and got a quick response and reasoning. No complaints and I am happy. So overall a very good experience and I would use them again. The ""B"" for responsiveness is because sometimes they can be a little slow to respond to phone calls at the beginning. But they are a busy company and produce at a high level, so I feel like a made a good decision to stay with them and this review should help with new customers who might get a little impatient to know the wait can be worth it. At the end Mike was very responsive, so I think it was probably more of a seasonal issue than anything else and like I said, I would definitely use them again."
5,"Service person arrived promptly and was shown items to be completed. He installed door and door knob using the the items I had previously purchased. He repaired the bi-fold door and removed the pantry door, shaved the bottom so it no longer sticks, and re-installed the door. He cleaned up after himself and left."
3,"The guy was quick, friendly, and did a decent job filling in the holes / cracks. But he left little globs of drywall mud all over my newly refinished wood floors. I really wish he'd have cleaned up better after he was done. Now I have to go around trying to remove those spots without damaging my floors. Pretty bummed out about it."
1,They are very hard to deal with. Not customer friendly!
5,"Couldn't be happier, great service, cleaned up when done and did an overall excellent job."
5,He did a good job. He was very friendly and helpful.
5,All of the work was very professionally completed. Clean up was also great.
5,"We had used The House Doctors previously to rebuild my hot water heater chimney when it was almost ready to fall through our porch roof (they did a great job). At the time, they also quoted us for putting a tub surround. At the time, we didn't have the money, so we put it off for a year. One year later, we decided to completely renovate the bathroom down to the studs. We called The House Doctors, and they promptly came out to give us an estimate (I would recommend calling them about two months before you want the service done ? their schedule fills up quite quickly). We were quoted a price and given a timeline of one to 1.5 weeks to completion. Mark came out and completely demolished the entire bathroom (noisy but effective). Then they came and hung new drywall. The rest of the project was ready to proceed. We had four workers out throughout the project: Project Manager Mike, his son Mike Jr., his nephew Mark and his daughter Steve. All of them were polite, dealt well with my overly friendly lab/collie mix (they are dog people). The only part of the project we questioned was their ability to start on time. Personally, we would have liked to have seen them start even earlier (I work from home and am up at 5:20 am each morning. I'm not suggesting 6 am, but 8 am would have been OK), but we all agreed on 10:30 am start time. For the most part, they showed up around 11 am and were usually done by 4:30 pm. While they were here, they worked like dogs, but we feel if they'd started even an hour earlier in the morning, the project could have been done by the estimated time (they finished the job in approximately two weeks). In the grand scheme of things, this is a minor complaint. The rest of their work was stellar. Our house was built in 1927, which means it is.......quirky to say the least. Our bathtub (which we kept) was two inches smaller than standard tubs now. The plumbing for the sink was in a weird place. But the project manager Mike is so skilled at so many things, he dealt with each challenge as it came up with cheerful resignation. Even better, he SOLVED all the problems with little fuss or muss. He is really a master at what he does, and I can't recommend him highly enough. For example, given that this was our only bathroom, they worked in such a way that we were never without a toilet. At first we used the one upstairs, but then Project Manager Mike had the brilliant idea of moving the old toilet downstairs (the basement) to replace another non-functioning one. This was critically important to us, and it helped our household of 3 keep from losing our minds. PM Mike installed ceramic tile on the floor, up the front of the tub (did I mention our house is quirky?) to replace some horrible, ugly tile already there, and around the base of the walls. We had trouble with ceramic tile a few years ago with another contractor (we eventually had to go with linoleum because of the problems ? which were contractor caused), but PM Mike's expertise made the installation a breeze. No problems here. Part of the original quote was refinishing our bathtub, which had been destroyed in a hydrochloric acid accident 17 years ago (don't ask). Unfortunately, their regular tub refinisher was stuck doing hotel jobs in Columbus. Owner Mike Vecchio (yeah, that was confusing) took money off because they couldn't complete it, recommended another refinisher and, when the quote from that contractor came in higher than expected, Owner Mike volunteered to pay the difference. Our overall experience with The House Doctors was pretty amazing, and we would recommend them to anyone who needs home renovations done. We would definitely use them again."
3,They did the work the best way they know how.
5,"The craftsmen were so thorough and meticulous. The repair was so perfect. We couldn't see where the damage had even been. They worked swiftly and neatly. They cleaned up the work area perfectly. No dust was to be found anywhere, even after they sanded the repair areas! As an additional bonus, they helped bring in groceries from my car! That was "" the cherry on top""! I would highly recommend them to anyone."
5,Purchased a 3 hour drywall repair coupon from House Doctors on weekend and was contacted on Monday with scheduled day and time. The drywall in my son's bedroom was expertly repaired so that my husband could paint it. Great job and great price.
3,"The contractor did a fine job. He actually finished all the work under the allotted three hours, but since he did everything so efficiently I thought that the $99 Angie's deal was money well spent. He even installed a three-switch light panel for me. Update: Subsequent calls to this contractor have gone unanswered, despite several attempts by me to contact them. I don't know if they are having some sort of a business-related problem, but I can no longer justify giving them the 'A' rating I had given them for their previous work."
1,I have tried to contact them about 3 times leaving a voicemail each time. As of today I still have not heard back from them. For this reason I am requesting a refund.
1,"I never wanted to have my house painted. When they showed up on March 3rd, I believed that they were bringing me an estimate for the work I had requested. They did bring a signed contract explaining that I had hired them for a painting project that also included some dining room work to replace some plasterboard. The plasterboard in the dining room was the only piece of non-painting work they did. I did not want to have the interior of my house painted and that is all they came to do. My daughter is blind. There were two rooms where she could have put her hand against the wall but they had left the wiring completely exposed. They didn't replace the protective coverings that had covered our electrical outlets which was extremely dangerous. This is contrary to what I had expected from them. Since the work has been done I have been told by several people who have seen my home that I had overpaid for my services and they couldn't imagine how I was so gullible. I feel that I was taken advantage of."
5,"The gentleman, Mark, was very knowledgeable. His work was very neat. He provided information we needed to prevent further water damage."
5,"Arrived 1 hr, 20 min late without calling to notify me. Stated upon arrival that they ""got lost."" But got to work as soon as they arrived and worked hard for entire 3 hours. House looked really good when finished. There was an issue with the coupon to begin with. No one contacted me to schedule the service, as stated, and when I finally called, I was told the coupon had expired, but they ""would allow it."""
5,"Mike did, as always, an excellent job. The House Doctors always do an excellent job. They are dependable and responsive. The quality of their work is always good. If there ever is a problem, they always fix it."
4,We had scheduling issues. I had to have lights put in first before the drywall could be done. I called Angie's List to get a refund.
3,Tried to get the work done and they have contacted me once but nothing came from it. Therefore I?m going with someone else to do the work.
3,"This is the second time I used this service thru Angie's and I'm not sure if it was the same person, but it did cost the same and their washer doesn't reach high enough to get all the way up the side of my house."
4,"Took out approximately 3 foot by 4 foot section of damaged plaster wall down to studs, replaced with drywall. I had to supply the drywall and all supplies. I had to pay Lowe's to deliver the dry wall because it wouldn't fit into my car. This was an unexpected complication and the delivery was an unexpected expense. The worker was pleasant to work with and did a good job. I am satisfied with the result."
2,"I purchased the deal in May of 2014 and attempted to contact the provider intermittently by both e-mail and telephone for the next month or so to no avail (they rarely answered the phone and responded to e-mails mainly by giving me the phone number where I left voice-mails that did not elicit a return call). I became frustrated and also busy with other things. When I attempted to get a refund later in the summer, I was told by Angie's List that the deadline for doing so had passed. They suggested contacting the House Doctors again, which I did. After many attempts, I finally got a return phone call and scheduled a date for the work in early November. They canceled at the last minute but sent someone over the following week. He was not informed that I had paid for three hours of work and had only an hour before his next appointment. He put a couple of finishing nails into the bannister near the top that helped a bit but not enough to satisfy the people who bought the house so it became a sticking point in the negotiations. The carpenter promised to come back to replace the door frame (which was entirely exterior) but never did. Overall, I was very disappointed with my experience."
5,It went very well. Mike did everything we needed done and everything works.
5,All went very well. We have not had any leaks.
5,"He arrived on time called to let me know what time he would be here. Got here and got right to work, worked on door first did a great job even painted the frame once repaired. He then worked on the drawers. Clean up and left after the 3 hours."
4,"It didn’t go as well as I’d have hoped. They left in the middle of the job and came back. It didn’t get done as well as it could’ve been done. I had them do the work in the kitchen, the hallway, and some living room work."
1,"Company response This was a real bad day because we got hung up on another person's job which made us real late for this customer. We are human too and we would like to extend a heartfelt apology to this customer. Sincerely, Bob Vecchio P.S. WE tried to re-schedule for another day but she said no. Company response HAVE TO SAY THIS. THIS REPORT IS A STRAIGHT OUT LIE. THIS CUSTOMER WAS SCHEDULED FOR THURSDAY SEPT.18TH NOT SEPT. 11TH.

THANK YOU, BOB VECCHIO Company Response: WRONG NUMBER--BOO--NOT TRUE JUST A VERY SPITEFUL RESPONSE. GLAD HE'S MOVING ON. Company Response: This is a total lie.

We tried but sorry that we couldn't connect. we try very hard to be all things to all people and sometimes you just can't. Bob V."
4,They were good. I had them to work in the basement office. One tech showed up to do the work; he showed up on time and worked the whole time. I had to pay extra for a few materials.
3,"The workers were nice however, the price was a bit high and the quality work was not what we were expecting."
5,I was very impressed with the workers technical skills and Efficiency in how he completed the job. We would definitely hire them again.
5,"Had a hiccup with the pressure washer and repair / replace the unit causing a delay. I did not realize that soap was not part of the package. Overall, he did a nice job. I was pleased with the outcome. The service provider was polite and prompt."
5,It turned out really good. They did a nice job. There were two people here doing the work. They arrived on time for the appointment and scheduling was good.
5,"Was generally happy with the patching, the larger area didn't turn out quite as smooth as I was hoping although it was a large area that had been cutout so maybe my expectations were too high. Had I noticed it before they left I'm sure they would have addressed it though."
5,"I received an email within a couple of hours of purchasing the coupon. I was a little taken aback when I called the number that came in the email as it was a generic phone company message with no name or company ID provided, but it was the right number and a couple of days later I got a call to set up the appointment., I think it was 1 days from the day I purchased the coupon until they performed the service. I am very happy with the work."
2,"We bought an Angie's list deal for 3 hours of wall repair for $90 with the intent of having the contractor repair some cracks in our plaster, exposed after wallpaper removal. I left three messages for the company, twice with a contact that ""wasn't the right person to talk to"". After two weeks, I finally heard back from the appropriate individual and they could not schedule anything until the middle of May (2.5 months out). This was completely unacceptable to us. This is not about the contractor: We requested a refund and Angie's list staff told us that they were going to try to find an alternate contractor to complete the work. This process took months and we finally just asked for--and were granted--a refund. These big deals should only be offered by highly rated contractors with available to do the work in short order after the deal has been purchased. This was a terrible experience all around."
1,"They were horrible, he gave me a quote and did an average job. Then when he gave me the bill it was about $800.00 more than he had quoted."
4,The service was ok. They had very good scheduling and availability.
3,"It was fine though there seemed to be lots of glue involved for a carpentry project. Cabinet has held we'll, though. It took several days for him to call me back."
5,The job was done in two days. I had to purchase all the materials and pay separately. The job was billed hourly but I would have preferred an estimate to stick to the price not knowing how long it would take. It took longer than I thought it would since the installer was not here from 9 to 5.
5,"Mark T. was the repairman/ drywall carpenter that came to my house from House Doctors. Very professional, and easy to work with...He repaired the drywall damage to better than new status, and I am very pleased with the results. I definitely will call House Doctors for future repair and house maintenance! Thank You!"
1,"We kept trying to set up an appointment. We finally set a date and time. He was supposed to arrive at 10am and I had to call him at 1pm and he said “was I supposed to do yours today?” He said he would be right out, but I had to call him back 3-4 times asking him where he was and he said the job he was at was taking longer than expected. 4pm hit and he said we would have to re-schedule, but I said no because I had already taken that whole day off for him! I didn’t trust him to come out."
5,It looks great. I would use this provider again in the future.
5,The provider came out this morning and said I should call to get a refund because the kind of work I need done is weather dependent and they recommended doing it in June or July.
5,"Finished product was good, but 99 dollars of plastering does not go very far especially when more mud needs to be purchased from Sherwin Williams and the travel time 1/2 hour from my home is included in the length of the service call. Also, prepping the area and clean up afterwards is part of the time frame."
4,"It was okay. It was a little more expensive than I thought or than they estimated. They were fine. They came in and did an estimate. I guess they didn't figure it out and everything so there's a little more that they had to do. Other than the cost, they were professional."
5,The crafts man arrived on time. I didn't have the drywall so he graciously offers to go to Home Depot to purchase some which I paid for. It was only $20. He worked very efficiently and it only took about two hours. I'm very pleased with The House Doctors and would hire them again.
5,"They did a professional job, unlike what other providers had planned to do. Rather than dig a new hole in a different location they removed the old post stump left from the original post that had snapped off at the ground. They also installed it to the proper depth of about 36"", below the frost-line. It was concreted in and sealed to deter eventual breakdown between post and concrete. These guys were not a couple of hacks. They knew the right way to do this particular job, not just the ""quick and dirty the homeowner will never know"" way. And they did it the right way. I very much appreciated the professionalism and respect, of me and my home, that this provider demonstrated. For this, and quality of work, I will enthusiastically consider them for future work."
5,"Christian & Bob were awesome. Not only did they complete my crazy punch list, but noted several items I MISSED that I should have had on the list...in a ""we noticed"", way, not a ""you should"", way. Though it took a while to get us all on the same schedule page, (good for them - they are very BUSY!!!), once we connected, I felt as though I was the only customer they had. THAT is good business. Thanks, House Doctors!"
4,"My thought was that the fascia was just loose, but it turns out the stucco on my house was not ""sealed"" and rain run-off was seeping into the fascia and rotting the wood. Significantly more repairs were needed. I very much appreciated the advice the technician gave me.... and in the short term, he was able to close the opening in the board -- where rodents were entering. I was a little disappointed in the cost estimate I received a few weeks later. It was higher than it should have been and was presented in a manner that implied I better ""fix it now."" A little too much ""pressure"". They caulked the window flashing....but used white caulk on brown flashing and told me afterward! I had brown caulk they could have used In general, this job went okay, but I think vendors see these small opportunities as loss-leaders to get their foot in the door."
5,It was good. They did a good job. The only thing was they ran out of mud and used ours. They left the lid off the mud so we lost that bucket of mud.
4,path was rough and the company wanted more to complete the work
5,"ng on Angie's List, everything went according to plan. An appointment was made, and although we were not present at the time of service, it was performed as promised. I am blind and therefore cannot personally rate the quality of the job, but my wife said that it was fine.After some initial confusion, since the house I wanted to be washed was not the address I was usi"
5,"House Doctors pressure-washing made the back yard patio come alive again! Job included doing the landing step that surrounded the glassed/screened in porch and the shady sidewalk that lead to the front yard?on all sides, the view is pristine now. Great job, would use again."
5,"It went well. Installer went with me to buy the materials I wanted, then come home and installed it all."
5,"Work was done, pleased with service. Big deal was somewhat limited in what they could do. Overall pleased."
4,The provider called within 48 hours to schedule the appointment. They showed up on time and worked diligently for 3 hours to pressure wash my patio and driveway. The whole process went smoothly and I was very pleased.
4,The gentleman got everything done that I needed to so he did a good job. I thought they were a tiny bit overpriced but he did a good job overall.
5,The House Doctors showed up as scheduled and did a great job cleaning the siding on our house. I wasn't home at the time they showed up but they did everything as expected.
3,Did not come on time Had to buy supplies .took lunch on my time did not complete job..Ran out of nails
2,Extremely slow response and had to get the job done. It took almost a month to get a call back in the meantime I had to hire someone else.
5,"Excellent service. Timely, professional. Repair work was very well done."
1,"It looks worse than when we started. They didn't make plans to come and fix it. It was awful. We purchased the coupon in May. They've been unresponsive. They schedule dates that we don't agree with. They came out when they feel like it and not when we've made appointments for it. We've had different information when we talked to the company. With what they quoted us the other day, it was outrageous."
1,"Appointment scheduled for a month or more. One hour before arrival time, I receive a call that they would have to reschedule and that someone would call me back. I explained that was not satisfactory because I had arranged to take this day off, cancelled clients, moved court dates as well as rescheduled a deposition. I told the guy (last name Vecchio) who called that I wanted his boss to call me back within 5 minutes. I did get a call back but it was the from the same guy and he said he had to leave a message for another guy named Vecchio. One hour later still no returned call. I reviewed other reviews and this seems to be a common issue with this company. The company seems to then reply to a negative review by saying that since they have been in business 40 years and therefore you should not believe the review. I WANT A REFUND. THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE BANNED FRON ANGIES LIST. I WILL MAKE IT MY PERSONAL MISSION IN LIFE, THAT YEAR 40 WILL BE THEIR LAST YEAR IN BUSINESS. THIS IS IS THEFT. PLAIN AND SIMPLE."
1,"I was away from my office at the time of the call, when I got back in I called them right back to say the date they requested (11/14/14), I would not be available and could I please reschedule. She said that ""he would have to pull the cards again"" and would get back to me. I have called several times and left messages on their voice mail, but never received a call back. I have emailed and they have responded that they would get in touch with me, but still no contact. On the morning of 11/14/14, I received a call from one of their workmen that they were coming to my house that day. I explained to him that I had cancelled that appointment and asked to be rescheduled. He said, he would speak with them and they would call me. I still have not heard anything. I would like a refund. If it is this difficult to just get them to respond and to reschedule, I am apprehensive of how they will handle the job. I would like to request a refund."
3,"Representative said he couldn't do the work and that they would typically perform very basic tasks such as baseboards, door molding, small jobs in general. However, I need someone to install my finished cabinets."
5,It went really well. We went to Home Depot to pick out the supplies. He was extremely knowledgeable and professional. His craftsmanship was impeccable. He was also respectful when speaking to me and when he entered the house. I am very pleased and will use him in the near future. Ms. K
5,"Very clean, nice repair, done quickly, Everything cleaned up after the job, This plumbing project will now make it very easy to turn the faucet off, outside, for winter weather. The plumber came into the house, did the job, cleaned up, and left the house within 1/2 hour."
3,"Did not go well. House Doctors were to contact me by Oct. 21 and I called them many times and eventually someone called me back the first week of November. They were unable to schedule me until December and gave me many reasons why their staff were out sick etc. Bottom line, they could not perform the work."
3,The gentleman from The House Doctors said that he couldn't do the job that I needed done. He was polite. I felt like he gave up and didn't try.
1,"In the end, I was never able to have services completed and their lack of professionalism concerned me that the quality of their work might be similar. Had several large projects that needed to be completed and the provided clearly was unable to get organized. I wasnt going to provide a negative review since I personally was not negatively impacted (other than wasting some of my time), but they have numerous deals and offers and so I think users need to be aware before purchasing one."
4,"Once the team finally arrived, their work quality and professionalism were impeccable. Unfortunately, we waited weeks for the origina job to be done and no one has responded to our request for a bid on our kitchen. A shame...these are great people with major prioritization and scheduling issues."
5,Was very punctual. Moved patio furniture off of the deck for me. Only complaint is that the pressure washing unevenly blew off too much of the stain on outer deck so it was uneven when I re-stained it.
5,"The crews shifted around depending on what work was needed on a particular day, but they were all very professional, kept the noise to a minimum and cleaned up after themselves."
5,"Considering the mess that the original installer left, it went well. I was consulted about a few things as far as if I would be satisfied with the proposed ""fix."" Mark, who did the work, was very pleasant, courteous and understanding."
3,"I paid Angie's list over 3 weeks ago but then The House Doctors could only schedule a drywall repair session in December, so, of course, that's waaaay too late and I paid for nothin. I hope they will reimburse us :/"
2,"Contractor seemed much more concerned with getting payment than actually completing the work. Several of the items on the job were not done correctly and the contractor had to return to correct and or complete job. Which he did. Also the cost for materials was considerably higher than expected. The Contractor could not provide invoices for the materials specific to my job to prove out costs. He just supplied a hand written list of costs. We had used House Doctors several times prior to this, when the company was run by his father, and were always pleased with the services provided. Sadly, we had a different experience this last time, and will not be hiring them again, nor do I feel that I could recommend them."
5,"We did not have the service performed, just because they were unable to schedule a service soon enough for us. They were very professional, prompt, and helpful in my communications with them though."
3,"I purchased the $99 special on 9/8 .. Received a message on Angies list to email my phone number. Got an email someone named Bob would be contacting me. Never got a call so sent a second message on Angies list on 9/13. Got a response on Angies list to ""send Phone number"" via email. Did that again! On 9/18 got a message someone would call me. Eventually...maybe a week later a woman called to schedule appt. Said they only work 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM...and no Saturday work. WOW great hours...So for a working person that means you lose a whole day of work! Anyway..Scheduled work for 10/10-soonest appt available. On Thursday 10/9 got a voice mail that ""both guys are extremely sick and we need to reschedule appt."". Woman who left the message said since they had to cancel they would schedule me on a Saturday even though they did not usually work on Saturdays. They would come out on Saturday 10/18. I was to call back and confirm. However, the phone number the woman left was not correct! So I finally found phone number on Angies list to call back to confirm. The woman apologized for giving me the wrong number. She said they would be out on Saturday, 10/18 between 1:00PM and 3:00 PM. Sounds good.. I asked if I needed to have the materials there, she said NO..they would go get what they need. So I blocked out everything on Saturday...so they could come get this job done. At 2:30 on Saturday, I received a call from a man saying he was ""calling to schedule my job""..REALLYY!!???? I was very irritated.. I said I was scheduled for TODAY.. Oh he said..Oh no..we don't work on Saturday... Again REALLY???? I was told on two different days that they did. Still have the voice mail. He said he would speak to the woman who scheduled me for Saturday...Unbelievable. They really don't care about customer service. I am now scheduled for 10/28. However, I am very leery about the quality of work they will do if they ever show up. NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE so far... Update-Work was completed on 10/28. The area around the new skylight needed to be repaired with new drywall and then the ceiling was retextured. Also a section of the wall was patched. Mark did a great job matching the texture to the existing pattern. He also replaced a section of drywall in the garage wear I had plumbing work done. I have no complaints about the quality of work. He did need an extension ladder to perform the work, but didn't bring one. Fortunately my neighbor had one that we borrowed. Otherwise he would have had to leave to get a ladder. The job ran over an hour and I was charged $100 for the extra hour and labor. That seemed a little high for an hour of work, but I needed it finished."
1,"The man that told me to reschedule said ""what kind of job is it"" and I told him I told mike it was for drywall in the bathroom. This man said ""oh, the coupon is for very small repairs. He said you need to read the coupon. FYI...It does not say that on the coupon. They were suppose to provide 3 hours. So they told me to get a refund from Angie's List, and now Angie's List will not give me my money back. I'm not happy."
5,"Job well done, no issues, and it was completed much more quickly than I had anticipated. The workman was somewhat late (and didn't call until after he was due), but overall it went very well and I would use this company again."
3,"Everything went ok, there were a few spots that they missed though."
5,They did a wonderful job! They replaced all of the latches on our drawers. They were prompt and efficient.
5,They are outside of my service area. I was unable to use the service.
5,"They came as scheduled, discussed the options and put the drywall. The work is top notch and the staff is very professional and courteous."
3,"We were told two workers would show up but three showed up. Things started out very good in that they covered many surfaces. The work included repairing the ceiling by matching the ceiling texture. The repair did not match at all. The painter did not paint all the way to the edge which left a discoloration all around the room. We called the owner, left a message that the job was not completed to our satisfaction. The next day the same workers came out , completed the work as requested. The ceiling texture did match and the ceiling was painted all the way to the edge. We were happy with the final product. Why didn't the workers do it that way to begin with. Instead it seemed like they were only interested in getting in and out rapidly. We also contracted for new steps to be put in the garage. The worker forgot his tool that calculates the riser height. He then left to purchase the lumber. Thank goodness my husband was there to make sure the stairs were done to our satisfaction. They did turn out very nice and we were happy with the results."
4,"The porch and driveway look nice but, he left standing water on the little deck. It dried partly with a dingy finish. I have to wash it and sweep the standing water away for it to look a bit better. All in all, he did a good job."
4,"when I was finally able to get contact with the company (took over a week) we arranged a date and time. The individual arrived timely. Hewas professional and appear knowledgeable.. His adult son also accompanied him and I assisted with completing various aspects. They completed the jobs efficiently. The thing I have a problem with is his poor responsiveness. When the workmen completed the job I ask them to check something in my basement which they did and indicated that the contact person would get back to me that day or the next. It has been one week and I have not heard from the individual. Generally, their pricing is very fair but I believe on 2 sections on my bill I was over charged,replacing 3 light bulbs should not cost $25 and replacing 2 batteries in 2 smoke detectors should not cost$15. By the way the fire department will do them for free forseniors. They are close and do good work."
5,Michael Rosipko did a great job and was very professional.
5,One man arrived at my house with his gasoline power wash machine. He asked if he could connect to my outdoor water spigot. I told him to do what he needed to do and he went right to work. At about an hour and a half later he was finished. He walked the perimeter of the house with me and explained what he found during the cleaning process. I was very happy with this service.
5,They did great. He fixed the door frame that I needed and he was out. I had some other things that I wanted done but it was not covered in the Big Deal and that was okay. He didn't charge me for the materials either. What he did was great.
3,"I purchased a big deal for this service. I was kind of disappointed with that. They said they were going to plaster and I had a big hole in the ceiling. And they said they couldn't do that. So they plastered a few places, but they weren't too tidy. We had a hole in the kitchen for the light and they patched that but they didn't put the fixture that covers that hole back. I thought they should have done that. When they left I had to clean up, sweep the floor and that from the putty and little bitty things. I was really disappointed that they couldn't fix the hole by the air duct and that basically what I wanted them to do. They quoted me a price to fix the hole."
3,"I signed up for the offer but when the schedule came up to schedule service, I discovered they are only available M - F 8 - 5. Unfortunately I have to be at work during those times."
1,My husband called on 9/25/14 to inquire about replacing some doors & received their voice mail. He left a message & we still have not received a call back.
1,I never received a call back.
5,"I was on a cancellation list, and low and behold, I was called and the plaster repair tech was able to get the work done before the holidays. The 99 dollars for three hours of repair did not go very far, due to prep times and the necessity for more product from Sherwin Williams which is 1/2 hour drive from my home which was included in the length of the service call. The job itself was done well, though completion had to be accomplished over several days for dry time before final finishing."
5,I had to cancel. I was called back a few days later to reschedule. We picked another day. I then decided not to do the pressure washing at this time.
3,Never was able to set up appointment.
1,He never responded and I don't want to move forward with this deal.
1,"Two weeks later...no bid, no contact. My wife gave a long list of work. I guess they are too busy. We try to support small business, but it is frustrating when they blow you off. Two weeks lost."
5,"They were very nice when we corresponded via phone and email, but they can't do the service quickly enough. Therefore, we won't be able to use them to complete this job."
4,"They did a good job. He was done with the job in an hour and a half. The quality of service was good, it was excellent. I wasn't there. He left when there was half hour left for the 2 hours. I don't think there were any additional charges other than the 77."
3,They sent a message stating they would call and it was open ended have not heard from them.
1,"I first made contact with the house doctor to get an estimate on 7/23/2014. I must have had 30 contacts with this company via the email, and a number phone contact via voice mail. It took weeks for them to come and give me an estimate for the cost of doing the job. They would call or email me to say someone will be calling or he has your estimate all figured out, and he will call. If you have the cost figured out; then why have they not sent it via email. There is something wrong here, and I starting to wonder if they do not want to put things in writing."
4,There were no troubles with scheduling and no additional costs. They completed all of the work I had wanted to have done in a timely manner. Everything was fine.
5,"There were a couple communication issues over what exactly was to be done during the job but I suppose that happens. Overall, Jay and the House Doctors did a great job! They were willing to work with me to get the work done so I didn't have to take more time off work. They made up for communication issues by giving me a price reduction! They did a great job and cleaned up before they left! They were very nice and professional on the phone. They even did a great job of matching the original paint job on the house with the paint they used on on the new fascia boards. I would use them again!"
5,"Power washed dirt and droppings from siding, giving the town house a clean and new look! Will have this done on a regular basis. We live near Lake Erie and house attracts a lot of bugs, birds, and spiders because of location. We could not have done this, ourselves and it saved a lot of work. Price makes this an excellent value. Don't pass this up!"
5,Best job ever. Highly recommend. I have found him to be incredibly conscientious and outstanding in saying that he will do what is necessary and do it excellently. I will definitely keep him in my priority file for a job well done and above and beyond the call of duty. He kept me informed and even texted me pictures of the work done. I couldn't have asked for a better company. A+++ Dr. JLJ
1,"The individual showed up at the wrong home. He wasn't sure if he had a ladder tall enough to do the job. And he wasn't sure he had a hose long enough to go around the whole house. He asked me if he couldn't reach what would I like to skip. My house is a small raised ranch. 1350 square feet. He told me that he should get the front done in an hour and then go to the back. I told him if he had to go over a little I will pay the extra. We had paid for two hours. I didn't stay to watch him during the job. When I came back the next day, it looked like he did the trim beautifully, but the rest of the front of the house didn't look like he touched it at all. I went in the back and nothing was touched. I called to see if he was coming back. I was told he can come back but I would have to pay the standard hourly rate. He did give offer me $10.00 an hour decrease. I ended up not having them come back. If it took them two hours to do the front trim of the house, I would hate to think how long and how much I would have to spend."
2,This didn’t turn out well. They didn’t put any soap in and just used plain water. The deck didn’t get finished as they didn’t wash the railings. The person who came out looked sloppy and gave the appearance of not knowing what he was doing; he was not professional. We needed to have the work redone by a different company. When I spoke with the manager about insurance licensing he was rude.
1,"When purchasing the deal on 8/25/14 it indicated we would be called within 2 business days to at least schedule the service. On 8/26 I received an email saying Mike Vecchio would be calling. On 8/28 I emailed back saying I still had not been contacted. On 8/29 I received an email saying Mike would be reminded to call me. On 9/5 I emailed again confirming we still had not been called and that perhaps we needed to go elsewhere to have the work done. On 9/6 (10 business days later) I was finally called by Mike. He said they were very busy because of this $99 deal which is why it took so long for him to even call me. I explained we needed some repair work done to the dry wall in our basement and that we had been pushing out our carpet installation waiting for the drywall work to be scheduled. I asked for a Saturday appointment but he indicated they don't hang dry wall on Saturdays. Mike instead suggested ""THIS THURSDAY"" which would have been today, 9/11. Since it had taken so long for him to call, he was going to get us in right away. I had him on our car speaker phone and asked my husband if he could clear his schedule to be home that day. Mike confirmed he would be there between 11:30AM - 12:30PM. I gave him my husband's cell phone number and asked him to call when they were on the way. Today is 9/11/14. My husband called twice this morning trying to reach Mike to find out when they were coming. His calls were not returned. I then called Mike at 1:18pm and he answered. Mike indicated that he had us scheduled for next Thursday the 18th. I don't know how this was even possible because when I made the appointment, we never discussed the 18th. I would have never agreed to wait 12 more days from the date of our first phone call. We needed the work done Needless to say, the job is not done. I have now pushed our carpet installation out yet again. MIke did offer to have someone come out tomorrow during the day but with this late notice, neither my husband nor I can take off of work, again. My husband already lost a 1/2 days pay today waiting. I told Mike I would be home after 6pm if someone wanted to come then but he said that was too late. At this point in time, I would like my money refunded.This is our first experience and I am sad to have to report such a low rating. I am very disappointed. I understand business is booming but does that really justify poor service?"
1,I tried to call them and left a voice mail for them on 9/8/14 and 9/9/14 but the never returned my calls.
3,"The person they sent out was nice and did a good job. If I had just rated him, the scores would have been much higher. Unfortunately, the communication with that person from the company left a lot to be desired. The day they came out was actually the rescheduled date. During my original conversation, I mentioned that this would be ceiling work, so I was told that they would send out 2 people to the job (1-1/2 hours instead of 3). I thought that was a good idea. Based on their deal, which was they don't provide the supplies, I called their number in the morning (around 10AM) the day before the appointment to coordinate all of the supplies. I left a message on both of the numbers they listed. After not receiving a call back all day, I called again at about 10PM and left a message that i was cancelling the appointment, since nothing was ready for them to work with . Strangely, I got a call back within 10 minutes. After talking on the phone, they informed me that yes, they don't provide the supplies and there's an assumption that you will buy all of the supplies from them. They wanted to get to my house, survey the job, then go back to their shop to get the supplies. That sounds good, but I own a house by myself, I have a day job and I can't take the whole day off just for this appointment. I also have some experience fixing up different areas of the house, so I had a good idea of what was needed for the job. I also reminded them that this would be all ceiling work. The same answer of sending out 2 people was given. I rescheduled the appointment for about 1-1/2 weeks later. On the day of the appointment, the person arrived as scheduled. I talked with him for a bit about the job and showed him the area to be done. He asked some very good questions and we agreed on what could be done given the timeframe of the work. Only 1 person was sent and he was unaware that this was all ceiling work. The job required 5/8"" drywall to be hung on the ceiling, so I ended up having to be his 2nd guy for the 3 hour appointment and helped him lift the drywall into place and I held it for him while he installed it."
1,I called 3-4 times to have a job done on my home and no one ever picked up the phone and I was sure to call during business hours. Not a good sign.
5,"It went very well. They did a nice job and were prompt at coming out. They were efficient, neat, and reasonably priced."
5,Everything went well. The work was done as requested and completed much to our satisfaction.
5,"There were no troubles with scheduling and no additional costs beyond the price of the deal. However, they did arrive a couple hours late to the appointment. They washed the stone on the front of the house, the back porch, and a portion of the driveway. Everything turned out fine."
5,There were no troubles with scheduling and they were punctual to the appointment. There were no additional costs and the service was good.
5,"Excellent experience. The workman was friendly, professional and efficient. Did exactly what I needed done and in a short amount of time."
2,"I very much liked the person who came out. Courteous, professional etc. He said he would call me (gave a time estimate). But he never called back!!! No work was performed."
1,The service was horrible! The provider does not use any solution to clean and so there is really nothing he is doing other than wasting your water. I actually asked him to stop washing the sidings mid way since I didn't want him to waste more of his time and my water. I asked the gentleman who was cleaning if he can come back with the proper cleaning solutions but he said that his employer does not like using more resources to buy cleaning solutions since it is not his main line of business. Why would one advertise for a service that they don't really specialize in and don't really care about. That is wrong and unethical! Stop lying to customers and stop stealing from us! I tried calling the owner to discuss the issue and either refund my money or redo the job but he refused to return my calls! I think this company is running a scam and people ought to be careful! I don't know where they get good reviews from if this is the kind of work they perform. At least return the customers call and come up with a plan on how to fix the problem not abandon the work and disappear! Stop using Angie's list as a way of getting quick cash from desperate customers!
5,"It went well! Initially, they wanted to use the same holes that were already in the cabinets. However, I eventually convinced them to create new holes and the doors close much better now."
5,Very well done... I would use them again.
3,"I will NOT be using them and would like my $99.00 back from Angie's List. Found another contractor not on A L. On time, made suggestions, had references and pictures of projects completed. Quote was higher but got our quote the NEXT day, not a week later."
3,We had the three hours of work completed as well as two additonal hours of work at the standard rate. The drywall has been applied through our entire basement and we asked to schedule a follow up to have the walls sanded. We were told we would be contacted in a few days to schedule the completion of the work. Its been three weeks and we have left three messages with no return call. Quality work doesnt matter if you cant get anyone to complete it
4,I feel like the charge was too much for the amount of work that was completed.
5,THE HOUSE DOCTORS DID A GREAT JOB AND WERE PROFESSIONAL AND PUNCTUAL BOTH IN RETURNING MY CALLS AND PROVIDING SERVICE.
1,"Called for a quote. Chris came out on Friday 8/8 took information, and said we would be contacted by Monday or Tuesday with a quote. I received no call with the quote information. On Wednesday I called and left a voice mail that I was wondering if a quote was available. As of today I have not received any response. Certainly does not want me to use them. Very odd and not very professional."
3,"I bought the drywall service to have a repair made in the apartment I was living in. The provider contacted me within two days like he was supposed to and asked for my phone number which I provided, but we never spoke. I had to have the repair made prior to my lease expiring and made that clear when the service was purchased. I had to hire someone else to do the repair because I had to turn in the keys for the apartment. I would appreciate it if you would refund me the $99 purchase price."
5,"Mark quickly set out to complete the drywall work as contracted through a special offered through Angie's List. He set to work on time, was professional, pleasant and neat about his work. A kitchen cabinet next to the drywall repair in the kitchen was in dire need of repair. To my relief, Mark accepted my request for this additional work. The task was challenging as the cabinet drooped, the doors needed to be adjusted, and the crown molding needed to be recut and rehung. Mark returned within 2 weeks to finish the drywall and cabinet repair with trim work--overtime on a Saturday morning. We are very satisfied with Mark's work, and we would hire him in the future."
1,"This provider, The House Doctors, makes better cancellations than it does appointments. For more than 2 weeks I've been trying to make an appointment, but either they do not call me back OR the number is the wrong number OR they have to cancel due to an emergency (twice). I'm officially done with this House Doctor. I was never even able to get an estimate for painting and drywall work on my home. Time to try the next provider on the list. I definitely DO NOT recommend this, (and I have a hard time even using this term), provider."
5,"I did have to phone the company myself since it hadn't contacted me after purchasing the deal, but everything turned out very well for the most part. The gentleman was very communicative about any delays or time issues, he and his assistant were courteous and professional, and they did a quality job in all respects. It was actually quite nice that the gentleman had an assistant because this allowed him to complete more work in the allotted timeframe. Furthermore, they cleaned up after themselves and kept the mess to a minimum which I appreciated."
5,the job is a nicely finished job.
1,Terribly. I bought the big deal and they never called even after you folks contacted them on my behalf. This is unfortunate because they appear to be a very good firm and I was looking forward to working with them.
5,"The provider honored the contract, even coming back on two different dates to complete the job. The dry wall had to ""dry"" and the area on which the work was done had to be touched up with matching wall paint. Getting the right color paint took me a couple of trips to Home Depot before I finally contacted the provider to let him know I was ready for the touch up. The job looks very good."
5,"The provider was prompt in contacting me. However, the company was not able to come out and do the work until later the following week. I was able to find another provider to do the work sooner."
3,"We purchased an Angie's List deal with the House Doctors that was $99 for 3 hours worth of plaster repair, which ended up being two workers for an hour and a half. We were contacted in a timely manner, etc. and the work that was done was of good quality. But I was asked to provide drywall of all things and garbage bags and I was still was charged $20 for supplies! I am not sure why they showed up to a plaster repair job without dry wall. I did agree to the extra $65 because everything I wanted done took a little longer but I still feel like I didn't get the 'deal' I signed up for."
2,"Based on Angie's list's recommendations, I called and left a message over the weekend of July 18th. I didn't get a call back, so I called again a few days later. Bob called me on July 22nd and we had a very pleasant conversation in which I described all the work I needed done. He expressed gratitude for calling his company, and I expressed gratitude that he called back. He said his son Michael would be calling me to set up a time to come out for an estimate. That was on 7/22. On 7/28, I followed up and left another message since I did not get a call from Michael or anyone else. It is now 8/1 and I haven't heard a peep. While I do understand this is a very busy time for remodeling/repair/construction, I just find it very unprofessional that I was told I would receive a call but then never actually got it. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and followed up with them, hoping they would redeem themselves, but they didn't. I suppose if you are in the market for repair work, it's best to call during the winter."
5,The most recent time we called them was to get an estimate on replacing a storm door. We chose not to have them do that particular job. However we have used them in the past and plan to use them again in the future.
4,"It took them a really long time to schedule a date. There was contact right after buying the deal and then nothing for months. Then out of nowhere, they contacted me to set a date. This was my only issue with them. They arrived on time, all fees were explained and they did a very professional job. They also cleaned up well before leaving. I would definitely recommend them if you have drywall work and the ability to wait."
2,"I already wrote an extensive review regarding the difficulty of contacting the service provider, but the review wasn't posted. I understand why the difficulty occurred but I'm not going to write another review that probably won't be posted."
2,"It didn’t go too well. I was unable to get ahold of him before I purchased the Deal. We wanted him to replace the wood ladder that goes up to the attic with an aluminum ladder. When he finally came, he told us that he couldn’t perform the service we wanted, so he patched two small holes in the wall. That went well. It took him about an hour and then he left."
5,MARK did a fantastic job. Got so much accomplished in 2 hours! Would highly recommend
2,Nowhere on the coupon did it say they don't give estimates. I can't imagine someone coming to do a job without knowing what they are going to do or what to bring in advance. More than likely the job would not be completed in 3 hrs which mean I will have this eye sore in my living room ceiling until they can arrange to come back and finish.
3,The soonest they can come out is August 8th.
5,"It went well. It looks so much better. They offered to come back to paint the ceiling but I had other work pending. They were friendly. They cleaned up after themselves. They were helpful, they explained what they were doing."
5,"It took a while to get an appointment because of the $99 deal on Angie's List...I guess they were pretty busy. Once I got the appointment though, everything went well. Mark was very professional, listened to me, gave me options, and left the room completely clean even after three hours of drywall repair. He pretty much performed a miracle! He has to come back to complete the job as it was a big job and took more than 3 hours. He did great work and I'm looking forward to having it done!"
5,"It was fine. The electricians were professional, fast, and very congenial. All the repairs were done quickly and done well."
4,Mike did a very good job and completed all the tasks I had for him in a very professional manner. Very pleasant to work with also. I was not sure if I would use this company again because I had such a hard time getting an appointment set up because Mr. Vecchio said that they were very busy. It took about 2 months from the initial contact to finally getting the work done. I would hope in case of an emergency they would come faster. I would probably use them again if I could get Mr. Rasipko to do the work.
5,"The service was quick, fast and easy. Everything is working very well. Thanks!"
1,"I first contacted them for an estimate June21st they cancelled and said they would reschedule but never got back to me, so I saw a Big deal and thought maybe try again, but got no response, I called left message twice and no return calls, this is no way to run a business, I've used them before and had no problem, but I am done with their service."
5,The doors look great and Mike did exactly what I was looking for.
2,"They sent out 1 person and he came out on time, but we were expecting at least a 2 man crew. When I first spoke to Mr. Vecchio, I told him to come out and give me an estimate first, but he said they would be ready to start the work when they got there. The worker who came out showed up empty-handed, without any supplies. My wife had to take off work and was very displeased about that she missed work without them getting the project taken care of, so we have canceled the deal."
5,"The contractor arrived on time, explained how he would do the job, and then completed the work. The plastering work in the family room matched the design of the rest of the ceiling beautifully. I would use this company again."
3,I purchased the deal and emailed House Doctors with several dates in Feb. Did not hear back and ended up using someone else. In April or May I received a phone from Mark Thompson who works for House Doctors. He apologized for the late contact but House Doctors had been booked up. (Probably due to Angie's Big Deal). He was very nice and I probably would use them in the future on a more flexible project.
1,I have used them before and was very pleased with them. They returned my call in a matter of minutes and were here within two {2} hours. This time I called Monday 6/23/14 and got a recording saying the would get back to me soon. I didn't get a return call on Monday 6/23 or Tuesday 6/24. I called them again on Wednesday 6/25 and got the voicemail again. I left my name an phone number. It is now Saturday and still haven't heard from them. I will call someone else on Monday. I will not recommend them to any one. The least they should done is call and told me they unable to do the job!
5,I've used House Doctors in the past and will use them in the future should I need any handy man services. They are responsive and reliable.
5,"The guy who worked on the house did an excellent job. It was not small accomplishment to get off the numerous coats of paint over the years and get the windows to look so excellent. He was polite, kind, conscientious and thorough. We walked through the project at the beginning and near the end. He cleaned up after himself and cleaned up more area than he had to. It was an exceptional job."
3,The service was good. It went as planned but I was a little disappointed as I felt it was incomplete. I felt they were using the Big Deal to try and get me to purchase more services. I ended up completing the job myself. The guys were nice to work with but it was not a complete job.
4,Not like I expected. Miscommunication. Not enough knowledge about lathe and plaster to make proper repairs
5,Pleasant worker and eager to please.
5,"They responded to me in a timely manner. They put one piece of siding on my garage, installed paneling in my basement and installed a pole in my closet to hang clothing on. They also boarded up my garage window that was missing. I paid extra to purchase plaster and paneling for the work, we went to Home Depot together to pick out the materials. The service worked well. I like them because they are able to do lots of different things which makes life easier."
1,"Purchased an Angie's Big Deal on April 19, 2014 and received confirmation email Mr. Bob Vecchio (bobhousedoc@aol.com)and replied with my name and telephone number. I had a voice mail message the next week, which I returned. I had a second voice mail message the next week, which I returned. Not having received another call, I called The House Doctors and left a voice mail with my name, phone number and my I was calling. I never heard back from anyone at The House Doctors."
1,"It was fine until my appointment day. He said he would be arriving between 8-12 today. At 2:30 he has still no shown up, I called and left him a voice mail. He called back and hour later saying I was second on the list, but I fired him. I could have been out getting things done instead of waiting all day on him to show up when he was supposed to."
4,"It turned out okay. There was a delay in getting them to come out on the side of the service provider. When they did come out, it was just one tech. I was not at home at the time."
4,"He was a very hard worker, and reduced my bill due to a mis-communication regarding his start time. In a confirmation call from his boss, he stated that a worker would be there between 9-9:30am. The worker showed up around 11:15. He stated that he never starts that early and apologized for the mix-up. I did contact Angie's List initially when I was trying to set up the appointment. I was having difficulty getting my calls returned."
5,It went well. The worker was on time and was polite and professional. He did a good job. The scheduling was acceptable and they were out within about 3-4 weeks. The cleanup was good.
5,"This was an Angie's List Big Deal. He had to reschedule twice, but once he got here, he did a nice job. He let me know up front how much he thought he could get done within the 3 hours included with the Deal and the rate for additional work. We agreed on the order he would do things and he got to work. The patio looks MUCH better and the siding too. He was careful to move a set of wind chimes I had missed so they didn't get damaged by the spray."
5,Scheduling was good. The fence looked nice when they were finished.
3,I’ve used them for other projects and the work was OK but again the pricing was way too high.
5,"After purchasing the deal, they were busy and we had to wait for open availability. As soon as they had an opening, they were able to come out right away. They completed the work and cleaned up well. They were no additional fees beyond the cost of the deal. My experience with them turned out very good."
5,They were very good. I am trying to get him to do other work for me. They were polite and professional. They had good ideas on things I was looking at. They cleaned up well after themselves.
1,"Gave supplier 3 dates as requested on original order. Supplier a left voice mail to call. I called multiple times but always got an answering machine. Supplier called back twice but never set a date as I requested multiple times. They don't listen to their messages as I told them to stop playing phone tag and give me a date. Very unsophisticated group without an office phone or email. They ignored the 3 dates I gave them and never offered another. Placed order on 5-31, gave up trying on 6-10."
2,I never received a call back to schedule the appointment.
4,"On time, professional, did a good job"
5,"Came immediately to try to find a rat in my house - was to return the next day, but could not due to family issues. Did return and stop up all possible entries for rodent. Clean work. Unfortunately did not find rodent!"
2,"Nobody called. I sent another email WEEKS later and still no reply. Finally I received a call from someone, but I was out of town. I returned the call and there was only voice mail. We played phone tag for a couple of days and then I received a voice mail message that I was being put on their schedule for sometime mid-July (I don't have my calendar with me at the moment) . Of course I will accept this date… it looks like I have no choice. I am worried about the quality of the work that I may get, seeing how poor their customer service is. The Deal was purchased on April 8th. So in essence, it's going to be 3 months before I get the work done. That, I believe, is a record for any deal that I have purchased through Angie's List. Too Long!!"
1,"I reached out a few times to get some more information, and I never heard back from them. I would not recommend this company."
5,"Everything went well, and we were very happy with the service. Scheduling the work was easy, the two-man crew arrived on time, and it did a great job without leaving behind any messes."
5,"We were very pleased with the work. They were very professional and worked very well. Rick was very good about explaining things as they went along. If they were going to be late and they were on two occasions they did try to call and let us know. All the work is beautiful, you can't even tell where repairs were made. Great job."
1,"I had water damage in basement during the cold. Plumbers came out to fix the problem and these guys came to rebuild basement. They insisted on half money up front. They got a permit and things that they were supposed to do. The quote was rather high, but I wanted it done right. I gave them a little more than half when I received my insurance check. My neighbors noticed they were not putting in the moisture barriers in the walls. The inspector also came out and noticed some plumbing issues and called that the work be stopped until the plumbing was fixed properly. The plumbers corrected the problem, but since then, House Doctors have not come back out to complete their portion of the job. I just want my basement done. I also noticed that a shovel was missing and my basement dryer was not working. It turned out they never turned the gas back on. They still have a huge mess and all of their materials in my basement. I have paid them all of this money, but the work is not done. They are ignoring my calls, not picking up their stuff, giving me any of my money back, or completing the work."
5,The job went extremely well. They called promptly after I signed up for my Big Deal. They called to confirm and arrived during the window they said the would. They checked in with me through every step as the job clearly was going to take more and resources than what I paid for in the Deal. They completed the job to my satisfaction and they cleaned up after themselves. I would definitely use them in the future.
5,They do very good work. I wish they would've called before they showed up. The painting job looks great.
5,He was polite and did his work. He completed all areas that were requested. Great Job!
5,"Looked at what needed to be done and told us what they were going to do, which they did. Finished work in timely fashion."
2,"I left a message. He got back to me, and told me he was looking at after June 19. I called him back and left a message with possible dates and he never called me back. I got someone else to do the work."
4,Job went ok. Provider did what I paid for and showed me how to finish the job myself.
3,"I've been calling this contractor off and on for over a month and have never received a return phone call. The number listed goes to a voice mail that only states the telephone number. With such a high rating here on Angie's List, I was expecting more. I'm still hoping to hear from them."
5,Scheduled and showed up right on time. Work performed fine. My concrete and brick are pretty old so I didn't have high expectations. They did the best they could do with what they had to work with. The House Doctors did everything as promised. I'd use them in the future for other projects.
5,He was very professional and personable. We did not have to wait long for an appointment and he showed up on time. He cleaned up after himself and even offered advice on other work items we need done.
5,Very friendly guys and quick service. Helpful and informative. It worked just as it usually does with The House Doctors. I continue to use them because I have such a great experience with them every time.
5,"I purchased a $99 big deal on Feb. 12th, 2014 and a few days later received an email asking for my phone number so they could contact me which I sent. however after several weeks they still had not called to schedule so I called twice and left messages before receiving a reply. by then they were booked out for several weeks so the soonest they could come out was beginning of May. Mark arrived on time and was very polite. they did a good job of cleaning up after themselves, and covering everything during the process to minimize dust. I did need to pay an additional $170.00 to get the job done ""right"" (second coating of dry wall plaster requiring 2 additional hours of labor plus $40 supplies). I was a little taken aback by the additional cost but do feel they did I good job. However at $65 per hour of labor for 2 guys I will definitely do the repainting myself."
1,He never bothered to call back.
3,"Overall, it went ok. They said they couldn’t do two stories, which I wish I would have known. I also had to pay for some additional time to get the job finished, and it seemed like they charged me for an hour to cover a half hour’s work. If I could do it over, I would not purchase this Deal again."
1,"When I tried to get an appointment set up, they told me it would be way far out. The man I spoke with was rude and did not have common people skills and didn't know how to talk with people. He told me to just get a refund."
4,Work was done less than 3 hrs but had to pay additional cost for parts.
1,"I’ve tried contacting them repeatedly, but I haven’t gotten any response."
4,"Generally the work was OK. The problem is that there was a push to agree to more work and, the the time, we didn't want it done. Within days I contacted them again to do follow-up work and do the next phase of what was started, and I never heard back from them."
1,When I call for my appointment they service provide told me he could not do the work until May 6 which was over 4 weeks away. I really wanted the work done so excepted the day because my Big Deal was going to run out but it was not a very convent day to get it done. I took off work and wait for him to show up. They did not even call me to tell me they were running behind. I had to call twice to find that out. Then they strung me along all afternoon telling me they me there in an hour. Finally at 4 pm they called and ask if they could come tomorrow. No you cannot come tomorrow I have work. If they had call me that morning and told me that they could not make it. I could have gone to work but because they did not call and then they strung me along all afternoon I wasted the whole day. I do not think they did not have any plan to do the work that day. I think they forgot about my job completely. Also I think part of the problem is I have the Big Deal and they did not want to honor it.
1,"It did not go. They did not answer me, contact me or anything. Angie's List or they got the $99 for nothing."
5,"Jim called to say he'd be 1/2 hour late but arrived on time and paid close attention when I showed him the work I needed done which included 2 ceiling cracks and several holes in the walls caused by appliance installations, etc. He went right to work and explained that one of the cracks would require a longer time to complete because the ceiling needed to be cut out and replaced with drywall. He had thoroughly inspected the damage and determined that the previous attempt at repair was shoddy and the ceiling had not been attached to the ceiling properly. The other crack in the ceiling did not require replacement and he was able to lightly plaster the crack which would then be painted over so that the crack didn't show. The previous owner of the house had not used the ceiling fan in the shower resulting in a sagging ceiling. Jim worked on the ceiling in the bathroom and got it fixed the patched the various holes then went for matching paint (which I paid him back for ) and when he returned the ceiling was dry. He then painted the ceiling in the bathroom and the results were wonderful. Beyond the original deal of $99 for 3 hours work, I paid an additional $180 (3 hours extra at $60 per hour plus $48 in supplies). For a total cost of $279 plus supplies, I was very pleased with the job and will set up another time to have the hallway ceiling cut out and repaired. I felt the price was right for the amount of time that was taken and Jim's attention to detail was great. He even climbed a ladder into my attic to make sure that the shower fan was vented out of the attic, not just blowing moist air into the attic. The end result was beautiful, more than I could have hoped for."
5,"Took advantage of an Angie's List Big Deal and glad I did. ""Jim"" was the man who did the work and he was very professional, even fixing a couple of things I should have mentioned and didn't. If Jim represents the type of person and quality of work to expect from House Doctors, we will be using them again. Very pleased with everything he did."
5,"The guy who did the work showed up about 30 minutes late but did call to let me know. The owner showed up close the end of the job. I paid an intro discount for 3 hours of drywall work. The work was done very well, however what I thought was a pretty small job (patching an area approx 24""-24"" and skim coating) took 4 1/2 hours so I had to pay an extra $70+. When he initially looked at it he told me he could get it done in 3 hours. I also had to do the finish sanding myself (they offered to return to do it but I didn't want to pay any more). Overall the quality is very good. I can't tell there was ever an issue with the ceiling. Although it took longer and cost more than expected, it was still far less than another quote that I got. I am very glad I hired someone who knows how to do the job right instead of trying to do it myself. He also gave me some quotes for skim coating and painting in other parts of my home and feel the price is too high for the work that needs to be done, although I am sure the work would be good."
5,"The House Doctors, as always, did an excellent job doing various work around the outside of the house. I always have full confidence in their work and they never let me down."
5,It was an Angie's List Big Deal that I purchased. It went really well. They worked well with my schedule. They gave me a couple of openings and one worked really well for me. I basically said there were two days that I could be home and they made it happen. They showed up on time. The guy they sent knew how to do the work. He knew the best way to do it and knew how to do it up to code. They cleaned up. I paid an additional $270 over the deal.
5,"Couldn't be happier with the dry wall repair job that Mark did for us on a $99 Deal. I paid for it in Feb. and asked if they could hold off till warmer weather for the work, because that's when the pops are worse. Mark came on 4/23 as requested, and this is a challenging area to work on in our house. It's been repaired twice before, but Mark tackled it really well, and it looks ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!! It may not last forever, but he did a fine job and is a great representative for his company -- polite, friendly and very talented. You wouldn't be able to tell that any work was done on the ceiling, 'cause it looks so good! This problem was part of a really large project done for us by Jeff Desatnik in January of 2013. Unfortunately, the 2 bad nail pops reappeared in the summer, along with the loose tape in the ceiling joint. I left several messages for Jeff in Aug. and Sept. and actually talked to him a couple of times, too, but he never showed up here. I know he's busy with big jobs (like our original one), but we hoped he would find the time to fix the problems we encountered in the areas he repaired in January. We liked Jeff a lot but are VERY disappointed in his lack of follow through for us."
1,"Purchased ""$99 for up to 3 Hours of Drywall/Plaster Repair"" on 09/03/2013. It has been 7 months and I am still waiting for Bob to be healthy enough to do the work. Angies List is supposed to filter out providers like this. Very poor communication and customer service."
5,"The garbage disposal in my kitchen literally fell off of the bottom of the sink when I turned it on. The clamping mechanism had become loose, and the unit fell down when the vibration of me turning it on made it come totally loose. The House Doctors were called at 3:30 pm, and the plumber arrived 3 hours later as promised, at 6:30 pm. He remounted the garbage disposal unit, and also replaced several of the chrome plated pipes under the sink, because they were corroded and ready to start leaking. The plumber cleaned up after under the sink when the work was done, and the left the kitchen spic and span."
5,"That went well. The deal was for three hours of work but they were here a lot longer and they charged me a lot more. It was expensive. They had to leave it to dry and then come back for more. They did a good job but it was a big job for three hours. The clean up was fine. It just seemed like it took them a long time, which is what I remember but maybe it was required, I don’t know. There was a lot more money and a lot more time involved but we liked them. It all worked well and it looks really good, you can never make out there was ever a hole there."
5,"They promptly responded to my call and set up an appointment to come out and do the work within a few days. They came as promised, installed the hose carrier, no muss, no fuss."
5,"bought a big deal, for 2 hours of handyman service. after a couple emails back and forth the work was scheduled promptly the handy man showed up exactly on time. the work did extend past the 2 hour slot, but he gave me the option to stop if I wanted to. works great! well worth the money to get that finished as I couldn't do it myself."
1,"I bought the deal on Thursday 4/10, indicating I wanted the service any time from Tuesday 4/15 thru Thursday 4/17. I got in contact with The House Doctors/Bob Vechio Saturday, 4/12 giving my phone number. Bob Vechhio never called me though I left two voice mails for him on two separate days during the time period I had wanted the service."
5,"This was a hard project because it involved plumbing and dry wall. After Marc got the dry wall up and painted, a water bubble was noted in the ceiling. All the work work Marc had done had to be removed. It was then discovered that the wax ring under the toilet needed to be replaced. The House Doctors sent Bob the plumber out to fix that problem. Marc came back, redid the dry and painted the ceiling and it looks just beautiful,"
5,"The repairman came about two weeks after I paid his starting fee. He was a nice guy that knew what he was doing. The job took a little longer than I thought it would to complete. Overall, he was a nice worker that did a good job."
5,"They are very busy, so there was somewhat of a wait for a time for them to come out. Other than that, no complaints or issues."
4,"I am updating my review below after the provider provided a response. I understand that the owner was going through dental surgery at the time I contacted him. I do wish someone called me after the fact to explain why no one reached out to me, but understand that things happen. Lousy service. I don't understand how providers in the business of providing ""service"" don't actually provide any. I emailed the provider and Bob Vecchio emailed me back on 4/6 to ask for my address, which I provided right away. I didn't hear anything so I followed up with him on 4/11. Bob e-mailed back and asked for my phone number which I once again provided right away. After that, nothing. No call, no e-mail. Even if he was the best man for the job I would not hire him at this point. I appreciate timeliness, responsiveness and basic professional courtesy - Bob and The House Doctors have none of these. Just a big waste of my time."
3,"They came out and really only did about two hours of work. They hung up some mirrors. I needed them to fix some aluminum siding, and the gentleman never even brought out a ladder. He promised to come back to finish the job, then the company never followed up with me. The work that was done was done well, but they did not do the amount of work I was expecting when I purchased the deals."
4,One guy came and completed the job over a course of a couple of days. We did have to do some rescheduling but everything worked out fine. They did a good job with the work.
1,"I purchased a $99 3 hour drywall coupon which was stupid on my part. You cant do much in 3 hours. They basically slathered mud on everything leaving me with a huge project to do. Months later all the mud has cracked and needs to be redone again anyways. The guy talked to me for about 1/2 of the 3 hours. Total waste of money. I really wish I had thought it through as all it did was cause me to miss work, lose $100, and have to tend to hours of sanding and remudding."
5,"When the scheduled workman called off because of a sick child, they found someone to come over since I had the day off. I watched the guy fix the stuck window that had been stuck open 10 years. He was pleasant and explained both what he was doing and what my have happened to get it stuck. It was once again a great experience. These guys are the best and have the best prices. They are my go-to-guys."
1,Did not return my call for two weeks
5,"Great job, polite and did all that was askied."
5,"Fantastic! Mike began by clearly outlining what improvements should be made and was very familiar with the housing codes of the City of Mayfield Heights. The depth and scope of services was significant.They capitalized on the few good weather days during March to complete masonry repairs on the exterior of the house, installed a custom glass block window to seal a cold storage cellar, and delicately removed an old t.v. antenna from a chimney. They completely transformed the interior of the home by painting trim, cabinets, doors and the like with a lovely oil based enamel. Kitchen cabinets also were updated with new hinges and handles that looked great. Plumbing repairs included caulking, installing a new faucet and filling in grout which was done with precision. In order to solve the problem of an unsightly open space in the rec room, Mike custom designed, built and stained a beautiful bookcase. Insulation was also installed to minimize heat loss. The crew worked hard, were on time and kept everything clean. Mike kept me informed on the progress of the job and finished within the original estimated time frame. I highly recommend them!"
5,My experience was fine. The results are good. Scheduling was great and they were able to do the work when I was not there.
4,My experience was okay. There was one person here doing the work and it took the full three hours. We had to finish the project since he was only here for 3 hours. Scheduling was fine and they were prompt for the appointment.
5,"I sent Bob an email and he as always responded right away. Being a female homeowner and always being fearful of being taken advantage of it is always a comfort to deal with someone who respects you. To hear Bob say ""Don't worry we will take care of you"" was such a comfort. Bob has a way of making you feel like you are calling on a friend instead of just hiring someone. This is the 3rd time I have had plumbing work done by The House Doctor and as usual it was done quickly and efficiently. Robert called me the day before made an appointment time and showed up at that time! He was friendly and professional. When he was done he left the area clean and free of any debris. Thank you for your service."
5,"Smoothly, they were easy to work with and professional!"
5,"The crew showed up on time, with all the proper tools, and aluminum material to be custom fitted to the garage door, people-door, and roof fascia. The fit, finish and color of all pieces matched the original pieces exactly. Very professional crew, they were polite and efficient."
3,"They did what we needed them to do, but I would say that it was top quality. Unfortunately they did not protect the sink which is one of those plastic marble type things. So, we got scratches by stuff they dropped in the sink. The plaster was a little bit bumpy. So, they are not a company I would have back. I know that they did not remove all the wall paper. I had to do that and paint the parts that they have not done. I am even looking at the plaster now and it is even pot-marked. The price was fine."
4,They did a nice job. Scheduling was not an issue.
4,They contacted me after a few days of me purchasing the deal. I needed it done within a few weeks because we were selling the house. He said he wouldn’t be able to come for at least seven weeks which was too long for me to wait.
5,"Good customer service, technician arrived on time and did good work."
3,"The washing of the house was completed and he used the remaining time to wash only 10% of the deck. The scheduling was an issue because I had to wait for over 30 days. So, I would recommend if you need the job done within 2 weeks."
3,"The crown molding looks really good. He made a huge mess though because he cut the wood in my house in the room he was working in instead of my covered back deck. He did a partial clean up using a small light pick up vaccum cleaner I had in the room which was not made for that kind of fine cleanup and when we picked it up it fell out all over the place. If we had know he was going to do the sawing in the room we would have covered the couch because it was covered in fine particles from the sawing he did in the room. Fortunately we were able to, and did, move the rug out of the room. But our PC was in there and who knows what got in it. Even though we had spoken a couple of times over the phone with someone about the dining room table, he said he was not told about it and did not come prepared to do it so the pieces of wood he used to repair it were way bigger than necessary and I am now concerned someone will bump their knee on it. The slider needed to be repaired and he didn't even address that directly. He just did, basically, a patch job so the table doesn't fall when we have to open it. The table is Ethan Allen so it is not a cheap piece of furniture to do a ""whatever"" kind of repair job on it. I might use them again but I would be selective about the type of thing I have them do because of the ""job"" they did on my dining room table."
1,"I bought the Big Deal for $99 for drywall repair. My first 3-4 phone calls to the contractor weren't returned. Then I contacted Angie's List for help. They told me that I had to use their new communication portal to contact the contractor. I tried that too but no luck. I finally got in touch with the contractor who said someone would call me back soon. I never heard back. I called a few more times. Finally, more than a month after my initial phone call, the contractor called me back and we played phone tag for a couple days, until he just stopped calling me back. I'll never use or recommend them for work at my house or my rental properties. As for Angie'ls List, I wasn't very happy with the service from the Big Deal group. When I contacted them a second time to request a refund, they asked me if I would be willing to use another contractor if they would be willing to honor the original Big Deal. I agreed and so they said they would contact me in 1-2 days to let me know. They never contacted me so a week later I asked for a refund which I did receive. I've purchased several Big Deals over the past few years and have never had a problem like this. I'm not sure I will purchase them ever again after this terribly frustrating experience."
5,They did an excellent job on 5 ceilings 3 of which had water damage. It was all completed within a day and a half and not a drop of paint landed anywhere it shouldn't have been. Thank you!
5,They responded quickly and booked the work in a timely manner. Mark performed the work and was very professional. He cleaned up after himself and the work itself appears to be of high quality. I am very pleased and will use the company again.
5,It went great. They were very pleasant people. They were on time and did good work.
1,"I purchased the Big Deal ($99 for 3 hrs drywall repair) on March 1 and a few hours later received an email from them saying they'd be in touch soon to schedule. I waited a week, and then replied to the email to remind them that I still hadn't been contacted. I did get an email reply saying that they would be in touch soon. It's now March 20 and I still haven't been contacted to schedule. Have requested a refund of the deal from Angie's list and have contacted other providers (who have been much more responsive). Can only guess that House Doctors can't manage the volume due to the deal, but the fact that they didn't even call to tell me that or get me on the schedule is unacceptable. Don't waste your time on this deal."
1,"I purchased an Angie's List drywall special from the House Doctors but they never called to schedule the work. I sent contact information and heard nothing so I sent another note only to receive a message back saying the information was received. I've called and left two voice mails and still not been contacted. More than one month later, I've still not been contacted to set up work. Needless to say, I wouldn't want them to do the work now anyway."
1,"Bought drywall coupon 2/7/14, Cannot get in touch wth anyone. Calls and e-mail not returned. Waste of time and money."
1,"The service provider is very hard to get hold of. After several calls without responses, I am tired of waiting."
1,They are very difficult to get a hold of. It is not consumer friendly due to nobody being on the phone. They do not call back in a timely manner. This is very inconvenient.
3,"The provider contacted us quickly, but was unable to schedule the work for nearly two months."
5,"He finished the patch in well under the allotted three hours (including a run to the Home Depot for supplies), so he found a few other cracks on the walls and patched those as well. It took several weeks to schedule the repair, but given the discount, I didn't mind that very much."
1,i WAS UNABLE TO CONTACT HIM. SOMEONE NAMED CARL CALLED ONCE AND DIDN'T LEAVE A MESSAGE. I CALLED BACK IN 5 MINUTES AND THERE WAS NO ANSER. i LEFT SEVERAL MESSAGE. IF HE DIDN' WANT TO HONOR THE COUPON HE SHOULD NOT BE USING THEM.. I WANT A REFUND AND WILL CALL
5,"Scheduling was a little tricky, but once I had an appt, Jim arrived on time and got to work. He worked efficiently and quickly and did a good job. The finishing (counter sinking/puddying the nail holes) could have been better, but overall, I am satisfied with the work."
5,"The House Doctor plumber arrived very quickly to fix the broken handle on my bathroom sink. The broken handle needed to be taken apart, analyzed, and repaired with new parts. The plumber quickly got the correct parts for the repair, he came back very quickly, he repaired the handle, he cleaned up the area and was gone within just a few minutes. All and all this was a very good service experience."
5,My 1/2 bathroom walls were left covered with wallpaper glue and uneven from a previous contractor. House doctors was able to fix everything and then repaint. The walls look new
5,As described above the job went well as the worker was very skilled and professional.
5,The job went very well. The worker arrived at the time promised and did a very through job. When troubleshooting he discovered the job was going to be larger than expected. He informed us of what he discovered and kept us informed at each step of the process. When unexpected problems developed he offered options and came up with solutions that worked. We are very pleased by the professionalism of Michael Rosipko and hope to work with him in the future.
5,"On the coldest (and probably busiest for plumbers) day of the year, I had a hot water pipe burst, spewing water through my kitchen ceiling. While I was able to turn the hot water off, due to the harsh conditions, I expected it to take several days to get repaired, and had no idea how much it would cost. I tried several plumbers, but the House Doctors were the only one to return my call that day. They came out that evening, around my schedule, and had me fixed up in no time. Very professional, answered all my questions while working to solve my problem, and under the conditions, extremely reasonable on price. Highly recommend!"
5,They did a fine job and would hire them again.
1,"It was the worst purchase I ever made and my experience was bad. He called me to book the appointment and he had to schedule a month out. I had a mold problem on my back deck I needed addressed immediately so I had to hire another company to take care of it. 10 days later, a kid shows up to pressure wash the driveway when I thought it was going to take a month for The House Doctors to come out. I was not expecting him to show up and no one gave me a call. He did an adequate job. I wish I could have gotten both jobs done, I would have gotten a better value out of deal."
3,They came out to complete the work I asked them to please call me if it was going to go over the 2 hours. I did not hear from them. They ended up trying to bill me for extra time. I did not pay it and I hired someone else to come out and complete the work.
5,Everything went fine and I was very happy he was able to take care of all my needs in those 2 hours. Scheduling was very easy. He was very pleasant in my home and did everything I had asked him to do.
5,Everything turned out just fine and it was all straight forward. One technician was here doing the work and it only took about 2 hours to complete. Scheduling went well and they called me set up an appointment. The results look great.
5,The House Doctor sent Jim who performed all tasks in a professional manner for a good price. Jim was prompt and responsive to all requests. Job well done! Thanks House Doctor. Roger K.
5,"They came out, and it was all done within a couple of days. They came out right on time, and I liked working with them. Mike was very friendly, very talkative at times, he did quality work, he knew exactly what he was doing, and if you asked him a question, because you didn't understand, he would take the time to explain everything to you, and tell you why he was doing it."
2,starting over from scratch and removing the work that was done. I have no choice but to do that. I expected more and am very disappointed with their effort.
5,"The job went fine. There was a small area in our bedroom ceiling where the textured drywall compound has pulled away from the drywall. It took a couple of calls to get a call-back. The fellow that came out was courteous, was careful about cleanliness and did a nice job patching and texturing the effected area. This was part of an Angie's List Big Deal ($99 for three hours of work). The only odd part was that after the job I was asked for $20 to cover materials. The only material was the compound used for skim coating an area about 3 'x 4'. I paid it, considering it a tip for a job well done."
5,It worked out well. They contacted me and then they came out as soon as I could schedule a time so they were prompt. They did a fine job and they worked with me to do exactly what I asked to have done. They were easy to work with and they were responsive to the requests I had.
1,"They showed up quickly, took my money, and never did the service. I had to pressure them to send my money back."
5,"They did fine. It was a sort of a Spring cleanup kind of thing because I had stains from the winter mold, but they got it done. They came up and did the work. They did the porch because the driveway is so small and they still had time left. They cleaned up everything and was gone."
1,"I called this company the week I purchased the deal in June of 2013, left a message and never heard back. I figured it was spring and they were probably busy so I would try again later in the summer. Later ended up being August and the same thing happened. I called, had to leave a message, and never heard from them. As of today I am out the $84 that I paid for this deal. Obviously, I do not recommend this provider."
3,"It was okay. That was 18 months ago. I was not necessarily very happy with the results of what they did. They just did seem like they completed the whole job. The price was reasonable, they responded quickly, but other than that, I do not know what else."
2,"It took numerous phone calls and rescheduling multiple times before someone showed up. I asked him to repair a rotten window sill after deciding to replace the sash chords myself. The worker who repaired the window sill was proficient. He was neat, on-time, and polite. The run-around with the father and son team was beyond ridiculous."
3,The service turned out fair. They came back once to try and fix the issue but the windows still leaks. They did try to rectify the situation. They came on time and did what they said they would do. If it wasn’t for the leaking I would have no problem with the service.
5,"The work was fine. I was going to have my son hook up the washer and dryer, but after talking with Jay he had said that he didn't come up with the price but it shouldn't be anything crazy for him to hook it up. He said they would call me to let me know the price. Well they ended up just sending me a bill and it had a an extra $158 charge on their that we had not discussed. I had already called a few other places to see what they would charge to hook up the washer and dryer if I had all of the parts. The pricing was around $60-$70. I have tried to contact the company several times to discuss this extra charge. I did talk to Michael on January 6th and they gave me a verbal quote of $220. Since then I have not heard back and I did call him on January 10th before I received the bill. I would just to hear from this company so that we can settle this pricing issue. Some of the things wrong with the service also were that he did not have a level to make sure the units were even. He forget to put anti slip pads that I provided under the washers adjustable front legs. He connected a hose that had holes in it to the dryer and glass box. I did tell him that my son would level it himself and that I would take care of getting the new hose. The cost of the additional plug was only $15 so I just don't understand the extra $158 charge. He also left out my 10% senior discount that is listed on his Angie's List profile page. Update 1/17/14 It is important that you have a firm understanding of what the charges are up front and make sure that you hear whatever the price is quoted. There was confusion on the price but it has since been resolved."
1,Bought the 3 hours but could not come for weeks and I needed a more timely response. The worst part was how much the man did not care about the whole thing.
1,"It didn't, no work performed, no calls returned"
4,"However, I had expressed some additional work that I was interested in getting done, they provided a quote, but when I decided not to get all the work done they quoted, I had a very difficult time getting them to respond on the work I did want completed. Trying to reach them was frustrating and I ended up going with someone else to get that work done,"
5,"We had a handful of spots in our home with broken drywall or areas that needed cleanup. They came in, were efficient and made everything look great (improved some of the stuff I did!)."
5,"Went well. he completed all tasks on my list, pleasant personality."
2,"Firstly, I would like to say Robert, who was the employee that did all the work ,was fantastic. I have no complaints with the work he did or him. He was professional, super fast, and did a great job. Bob, the owner, in the beginning, was responsive and offered a great service at a nice price. Hence the ""D"" rating rather than an ""F"" rating. Our original appointment was rescheduled, then the day of the rescheduled service the time was changed by the house doctors. You know, life happens, we wait for most contractors to be honest, they are kind of unpredictable; no biggie Robert came and efficiently and professionally did a great job. He was here for 1 hour and 45 minutes, he left and we waited for an invoice. We were set up for an hourly rate for our service. When the invoice arrived it stated that he was here for two and a half hours, confused as that was 45 minutes more than he was actually here. My husband called and left a message inquiring about the extra time (after complimenting the job well done and being totally polite). We received a short and dare I say snotty toned message from Bob saying that we were charged for travel time. I called the next day to ask why (in a professional non-confrontational way), as it is clearly noted on their advertisement on Angie's list that they do not charge travel time. He was rude, insulting and almost to the point of yelling at me over my question. I mean, fair is fair, I was charged 30% more for a service than I should have been, and as a responsible consumer, I wanted to know why. It wasn't a lot of extra money (the price was actually good for the nice job that was well done), but I found the upcharge to be underhanded. He explained to me in a very condescending way how we lived so far away that I should be glad I wasn't charged more and they ""bent over backwards"" for us. There are also 5 other jobs listed that were done in our area, so they do come to our area. Also, when the job was accepted my location was known by Bob and if he wanted to charge me travel costs he should have told me up front; especially since they advertise differently. The funny thing is I would have had no problem paying for travel time had I been told about it, and actually I did pay the bill in full. He was so unprofessional with me I felt uncomfortable not paying in full in fear there may be some repercussion for me not paying the full invoice amount, even though he told me not to pay it while he was nearly yelling at me and hung up on me. I worked in customer service for 22 years, I have never treated anyone like this and know I didn't treat him like that, it really bothered me. My advice if you hire this company please plan on having NO questions and No problems, as they may be handled very inappropriately and poorly . I also noticed a very similar review from another customer on this site about how Bob handled their complaint. Seems this isn't an isolated incident."
5,"The staff from the House Doctors are always great. The problem was fixed quickly and efficiently--a small, metal bottle opener had gotten wedge in the garbage disposal. It now runs perfects and the old bottle opener was trashed."
5,See above -- all went very well and I would use them again.
5,Mike did an amazing job. He came on time and did everything he said he would do. I would recommend him to my friends and family.
1,"Played phone tag for weeks, didn't seem interested in actually scheduling a job or wanting my business. It shouldn't be work for me to give my money away!"
2,"We first contacted the House Doctors in early November after seeing an add in the monthly Angie's list magazine for the House Doctors we made the initial phone call. We were contacted the week prior to Thanksgiving and told that ""they were doing gutters following week."" We were quoted $69 per hour. The Angie's list add stated $100 off for members spending at least $200. The week no one came or called. On Dec 9 received a call they would be there on Dec 10. On December 10 a gentlemen arrived. We were surprised to learn he was an independent sub-contractor of the House Doctors. There was never any mention that sub contractors were used. He was very polite and performed well, however, we should have been advised. The problem arose when it came time to pay for the service. We were quoted $69 / hour plus the materials; which consisted of one downspout elbow. At a little under 3 hours plus materials the total should not have been much more than $250. However, when the gentlemen contacted his boss from his truck and said he was told to collect $340. That is $100 more than quoted. There was a lot of back and fort and we were finally able to pay the agreed upon price. We will not be utilizing the services of the House Doctors again."
5,I purchased 3 hours of work for $111. The handyman arrived promptly and worked diligently for the entire 3-hour period. He did a good job and cleaned up the area when he was done. it was a big job for one person and he did a very nice job.
5,"House Doctors is one of the best companies we have ever worked with--every business should model themselves after House Doctors. They came within two days of my call to look at the job and give me an estimate; told me they would be out in two weeks to do the work; came exactly when they said they would, then would only accept payment after I confirmed that I had reviewed the finished work and was satisfied. The work was perfect. Would recommend this company to anyone."
5,Home was immaculately cleaned and passed my wife's scrutiny
5,"I was extremely pleased with their service. They worked me into an already busy schedule to help clean prior to my son's graduation party. Lori and her daughter worked really hard to get to all the areas I had requested they clean. They did an especially thorough job on the bathrooms and on my wood floors. They changed bedding in the guest room, folded the pile of clothes in one of my kids bedrooms and helped me with a few other things not typically expected. At the end of the day they made sure I was happy and that there wasn't anything else I wanted them to do before leaving. I have nothing but compliments for them. They were hard working, quick, careful and most important of all very pleasant and helpful!"
5,"Prompt, professional service, accomplished exactly what I needed as the coupon price which was excellent"
1,"I called and scheduled for them to come and clean my gutters. It has been 3 weeks and they have not shown up to do the work. I have also not heard from them. I just received a call from John stating that he himself was the one here that claims he cleaned my gutters 2 Tuesdays ago 12/17/2013! He stated he was told by his boss to do the best job he could as everything was frozen. I called to have this completed before Thanksgiving! The gutters are still full of leaves! It is not my fault they waited a month to come clean my gutters. They were NOT frozen when I asked them to clean them. They should have called me to reschedule when they were NOT frozen as this is CLEVELAND!!!!! Bob, I have a check made out to your company which I will be more than happy to give to you when the job has been completed properly and to my satisfaction!"
5,"The work was performed in a professional manner, the representative was personable, and very knowledgeable did an outstanding job and worked very efficiently"
1,"It was an Angie's List Big Deal that I purchased. It did not go well. I needed the job completed for an inspection. It was a violation on an inspection and I explained it to a guy named Bob. I told him that I was going to need pictures prior and he said that he would have to take down some of the drywall and replace it. I told him that I needed pictures while he was doing it and I needed it done by a specific certain date, which was the date of the inspection. According to my tenant, he showed up and started the job and then said that he would have to come back and then we never saw him again until a month later when he showed up to finish the job. It was 3 weeks after the inspection so I had to have somebody else finish it. They sent me a bill for over $700. They never called me and I kept sending them text messages to ask them if it was done or when it was going to be done and where the pictures were. They never responded to any of my text messages. I left voicemail messages and they never responded. I have no intentions of paying the bill they sent."
5,We had our plaster ceiling in the kitchen repaired. They repaired the |hole in the ceiling and painted ceiling. I would use this provider again but only if they had another special. The hourly rate of $65.00 per hour is a little dear for me.
4,"Purchased the deal in September. Played phone tag/email tag. Finally was scheduled then worker called in sick. Re-scheduled, quote was higher than expected and I backed out. Missed 2 days of work. They were very understanding in my wanting to cancel. I may do this at a later date, but not now."
5,"Serviceman arrived a few minutes early, was polite, and had materials, supplies, and tools with him. He did have to run to the home improvement store for something, but returned promptly. He worked quietly and efficiently for the three + hours and cleaned the area when finished."
5,They were very nice. Hard to make an appointment because they were very busy. The gentleman who came did a nice job and was very professional.
5,"This was a special - 2 hour $75. They were very responsive setting up the appointment and calling back when I had a question after. The handyman was prompt, clean and friendly. Better yet he was very skilled. He handled all the tasks listed in the two hours and then I had him look at some future projects. I felt I really got my money's worth. The company and the representative were very professional and I would use them again."
5,"Michael Rosipko did a fantastic job under brutal conditions. He was professional, informative and efficient."
5,Rod from The House Doctors came. He is always professional and did a good job cleaning out the dryer vent line. He was efficient and thorough.
2,"There were 4 half-dollar sized holes in my ceiling above my steps. They didn't patch them, they just put tape over them. They did not do the work that was contracted to be done, they were supposed to patch the holes up and prepare them to be painted. With the plumbing, it was a fiasco. I had contracted with them to replace all my pipes, they had to take the ceiling down and didn't replace all the pipes. and again, did not follow through on what they were contracted to do. I feel like they took money for one job and ended up doing something very different. I would not recommend them or not use them again in the future."
5,"The major item that needed taking care of and the report that I received was that the gentleman did a terrific job. I had some ceiling tiles that had been damaged due to water leaking from a toilet upstairs. He came in and replaced the tile that had been damaged and if I had found the same type of tile the job was done so good that you wouldn't know that it had been repaired. He also replaced the caulking around all my windows and patched some holes in the driveway. | |I will use again, I have a few more things that I need to have taken care of. | |"
5,My experience went very well. The staff was very professional and friendly while visiting. They are a great company. The pricing was reasonable and I would highly recommend them to others.
5,The workman had not seen our configuration previously--the gutters were actually glued to the fascia board. It required some maneuvering to fix the dents from the branches that had fallen against them and crinkled them plus damaged the gutter guards. The workman were pleasant and friendly. They did a professional job and made it almost as new. The House Doctors are definitely worth every penny I pay them!
5,"I've called Bob before to help me out with various repairs. This time, I didn't know in which category my repair needs would be. I know Bob and his crew did many things. So I called him, explained my situation, and he sent someone out quickly to fix them. My problems: my pickup truck lost its brakes one day as I pulled into my driveway and hitting the brakes didn't work. I continued into my garage and into the back wall, knocking a few studs off the base far enough that you could see the grass in back from inside the garage. A little while later, I pressed the garage door button too soon before I had pulled out far enough. The door came down and hit the top of the cap on the truck. It left a dent in the bottom of the garage door and knocked the garage door roller off the track. I called Bob in a panic, but he assured me he would get out to fix it quickly and I was not to worry. True to his word, I had someone here within a short time. You can't see where the back was repaired; it was done so expertly that even the siding on the outside doesn't show signs of ever having been damaged. He got the garage door straightened out and the roller back on its track. Except for a small indentation on the bottom of the garage door, it looks and works as good as new. It seems like the House Doctors can do almost everything. They've always been so responsive and professional. And they get the job done well. It reminds me of the Ghostbusters saying ""Who do you call? Ghostbusters"". But I say ""Who do you call? House Doctors!"" It helps that I was allowed to pay for it in 2 installments with no interest or fees, and I got a 10% senior discount."
5,"Overall, they are great to work with. There were at times some issues with some of the work. Given the scope of all the work we were doing, this is not surprising. What is important to me, is that they are responsive to feedback and concerns. Not only were they responsive, but the crew really went out of their way to address any issues that come up. We are continuing to work with them, and I would recommend them without reservation."
5,"could not have been better. I read on line about assemble of the shed. I knew that I could not do this, even with help of a friend. It is perfect. I have used them in the past and will continue to use them in the future. They stay in touch through out the entire process."
5,"See Above, Power washed the house, scraped, caulked, and painted the house and shutters."
4,"It went okay, I had to pay extra money for the second half of the house but they did a good job."
4,"Purchased the deal, try to contact them multiple times. No one answers the phone. Finally got a call and the earliest appointment is one month later. So I had to find someone else to do the work, thus want to cancel this purchase. Thanks."
4,Responded within a week and gave me a fair estimate.
3,"I bought a big deal coupon for the House Doctors. Someone came and did great work. I was happy enough with the service to purchase a second coupon. Unfortunately, after numerous phone calls, the company and I were unable to come to a mutually acceptable date for the second visit. I am averaging my good experience with my less happy experience to get the C grade (really more like a B-)."
2,My experience was dissatisfying. I called late in the season and they came to put the coat. Cracks and damage started to appear and I asked that he come repair the cracks. He said it was too late in the season and would not come back to repair the driveway.
5,"First they checked the roof and thought they had found the problem, so they repaired and painted the garage ceiling and wall, but then it rained and caused a big hole in the ceiling and caused the wall to bubble. They came out and looked at it and contacted a roofing expert, who said that we needed to replace all of the shingles, that it was caving in and would cause more problems if not done."
2,"I spoke with the provider about my job prior to purchasing the big deal and was satisfied with using them. After the purchase of the deal I did not hear from them, I called several times a week to multiple numbers and left messages but did not receive any calls for over a month. The last time I called, I advised that I was very interested in using their services and I was not in a hurry, but just wanted a return call to get an idea of when we could schedule, but I would have to seek a refund if I did not hear back. I bought the deal for 1 job, but I have multiple rental properties and have been seeking a new handyman to work with for future jobs. I was very disappointed overall."
3,"It all went downhill quickly after the initial six hour ""Spring Clean"". Since I was very pleased with the initial cleaning of my home, I scheduled The House Nurses for biweekly cleaning. The first of these visits did not go nearly as well as the initial cleaning of my home. Laurie, the owner, was accompanied by her daughter. Laurie did a good job with the cleaning she performed. However, she was not very organized, and did not seem to know what her daughter was doing. Tasks that I specifically noted as being a priority, such as low dusting of furniture, were not performed. When I asked about it, Laurie's daughter stated that it was done, but got dusty again after vacuuming. I was in the room, and I was sure that it hadn't been done. I can understand something being overlooked. However, I have a problem with lying about it. When they stated that they were finished, I was very surprised. Almost nothing in the living room had been cleaned, most notably the glass topped coffee table. When brought to their attention, they did clean the coffee table before they left. I would rather they had budgeted more time and did a better job of cleaning. I had expressed this to Laurie. Two weeks after this housecleaning, The House Nurses were scheduled to clean again. On the appointed day, they did not show up, and did not call to cancel. Very unprofessional!"
5,"We contacted the House Doctors for a handyman special for our house. After speaking with the owners about the house project, we asked them about a large drywall project at our church. They gave us a bid which was below some others that we had received and a couple of weeks later sent their crew to begin the project. The crew presented themselves in a very professional manner, were very friendly and open to suggestions for some minor changes in the project. They cleaned up after each day's work and were on time each morning to begin the work. The drywall project included installing firing strips, application of drywall, and painting. It involved working between 8 to 15 feet off the floor. The job was beautifully done and received quite a few positive comments from our parishioners."
5,"It was fine. I gave them a tip, but I didn't spend anymore than the cost of the Big Deal. They were very nice, they did their job and then left. I would use them again with an Angie's List discount, but their regular price, if I remember, is a bit hefty; so I don't know if I'd use them without one."
1,I am requesting a refund because they would not answer and return my calls.
2,"We called this provider, but they never returned our call."
3,"Both young ladies were delightful but explained to me that the service was a little unorganized since the owning partners spit and the staff was reduced by half. It was apparent that neither girl enjoyed the work but at least one of them attempted to accomplish the task. The younger girl was not at all experienced in the housekeeping field and needed total supervision from her co-worker. Nice girls but really unenthusiastic about their jobs. It was a little Disappointing, especially since they advertised it as Spring Cleaning. The service was simply light surface cleaning. I do hope the owner can get her business straightened out, she was very responsive to my calls and very accommodating with days and times."
5,"I love them. They are fantastic. I would recommend them in a heart beat. They went over and above and knock themselves out, we will have them back."
5,"Three crews showed up on schedule, and went about doing the interior, exterior, and 2nd floor all at the same time. All work was done very neatly, no flaws, and the crews cleaned up all the areas perfectly. All work done very quickly, and professionally. The manager came by the next day to inspect the work and ensure everything was done correctly."
5,He did a good job of painting. Clean up after the job. Was professional.
5,I am very pleased with the work done by the House Doctors. The workers were always on time. They were polite. They cleaned up everyday when they were done. They kept me informed about what was going on. There was a lot of sanding and scraping to do. I was amazed how well they cleaned up all the dust and paint chips. They did a great job tuck pointing and painting the walls. The epoxy floor looks outstanding. The basement looks 100% better. Brian always returned my calls if he was not avaible. He explained everything that was being done. He worked around a few days when I was not avaible. I will use them again when I have a problem.
3,"There are a lot of reasons this review should be more positive. However, the problem for me was in the communication. When the handyman showed up on the 19th (Mark) he could not have been nicer, more professional, and the job was fantastic. He called ahead to let me know he was running a little late, cleaned up meticulously, worked very fast and carefully, and was flexible in working with me as I got materials for one of the jobs. Also, Bob, the fellow who communicated with me via email was responsive and helpful. However in the interim between one of the fellows (Mike) who was supposed to have taken on my job did not respond to phone calls, left messages to call him and suggested times to do so but then did not pick up the phone, so that was frustrating and I lost time with that. If I had not already bought the big deal I would have moved on, but I had paid for the work and needed someone to do it. We finally talked on the phone, and Mike very kindly fit me in to work with my schedule. I understood we were to meet on Aug 16th sometime between 10 and 11:30 a.m. Mike called me on the 15th and asked me to call. He did not say why, but I wanted to speak with him anyhow because I wanted better information about the time of arrival. I called several times with no response. I left messages that evening explaining that I would be leaving work the 16th and asking Mike to let me know a more exact time so I would not miss as much work. I got no response. The 16th I traveled the 50 miles round trip to be there at 10 and while waiting there called him a few times again to ask what was going on and again received no response. I waited until 12:30 and then left still havign heard nothing. I emailed Bob that weekend just to let him know what had happened and got a response immediately. The problem was fixed on Monday when I traveled the 50 mi round trip again to meet the fellow Mark who did such a great job. Apparently, Mike and I had understood different dates. I can understand such a situation. I cannot understand a refusal to call to tell me we had miscommunicated so that I would not travel out there the 16th for no reason. So I am left in a quandary. The work was outstanding and the workers very pleasant to deal with except for the communication issues. If I had the time to spare and did not have to travel so far I wouldn't hesitate to try them again, but I probably wouldn't risk it since both are an issue for me."
5,"He worked very hard. It was a nasty, dirty job, and I was very pleased with the results."
5,It worked out great. I was very pleased. He was very courteous and punctual.
3,"I bought the coupon and Bob called soon after. At that time I told him I wasn't ready but had several things I wanted done. I emailed him photos and a list of things I needed done. He never responded. I called and left a message with no response from that either. In the meantime I had to have this work finished so hired another handyman from Angie's List. Towards the end of the coupon validity time, he called but the work had already been finished. I gave him a ""C"" because he did call right away, but he should have responded to my email and other phone calls."
1,never responded did not show up for the cleaning no calls nothing
5,"Rod, the electrician came to evaluate job. He was timely, professional and polite. The evaluation took minimal time and I received a quote the next day. Bob Vecchio scheduled work with me when I got quote and repair was completed that week."
5,"It took a bit to finally set an appointment, multiple missed calls, on both ends. Would be nice if they had a ""live"" operator to handle calls. Had an area on kitchen ceiling that had been repaired, plastered a number of years ago due to a leak. No reoccurrence of leak however area started to crack, looked as if a repair had been done, not very smooth, kind of ""drooping""...Purchased a 3hour plaster, drywall repair back in April. Mark arrived on time, had called to inform me what time he would be starting.. I purchased supplies needed for the repair. I was given 2 options of repair work, decided on the least invasive option, after discussing what the best choice would be. Mark did a great job, protected furniture in the area where the work was being done. He finished the job quickly, ceiling looks great! In the end, he didn't need some of the supplies I purchased as he had some of his own available and the job didn't require too much. All questions answered. Would definitely hire again."
1,"Service provider never showed up when scheduled. This was a huge inconvenience to the member, please refund immediately."
5,Everything was done timely and neatly.
1,"I left two messages on each of the phone numbers listed in the last two weeks and still have not had a return phone call. I understand that this company might be busy, but at least an appropriate response would be professional."
5,"They did a very good job. Bathrooms, especially, exceeded my expectations. There were a few areas they missed, but after I pointed them out, the team immediately fixed those areas. I initially had a dificult time getting in contact with the House Nurses, and didn't receive a call back after several messages left. However, they had a wrong number for me and once we realized this, the housecleaning was quickly scheduled."
5,It did take a while to get on their schedule but I'm sure they get busy in the spring/early summer. They arrived on the scheduled date and time and completed all the work in a timely manner. They even came back the next day to haul away the old broken gate.
3,"Generally, I would say they were very courteous, but the cleaning was only ok."
3,"I hired these folks to come wash my driveway. Our snowplowing service left some rusty trails on the driveway during the winter and I wanted the spots cleaned off as well as the driveway powerwashed. After purchasing an Angie's List Big Deal from this company several months ago, they were quick to contact me and set up an appointment. They were willing to come sooner, but I asked them to wait until June, after we mulched, as I knew the mulch pile would leave a big mark on the driveway that I wanted cleaned off. A rep from the company called me the morning of the appointment to make sure they could still come out and perform the work, as it was raining that day. I said it would be fine, as long as they could wash our driveway effectively in the rain. She assured me it would be fine. I appreciated her professionalism. She said they would arrive between 10:30 and 11:00 to do the work. At about 10:15, a young man showed up at my door. I was on an important phonecall and not ready to come outside since he was early. I apologized for being on the phone and asked him to wait a few minutes. He didn't even crack a smile or say anything to me. He just walked back to his truck. About 10 minutes later, I finally made it outside and asked him to start on our driveway and then move to our sidewalk and patio when he finished the driveway. He was unfriendly, slow moving, and unprofessional and barely said two words to me. It just seemed like he wanted to be anywhere but powerwashing driveways. Hey, I didn't blame him, but it did reflect poorly on the company. Last fall, I had another power washing company come out and wash our whole house, all three sidwalks, and our driveway as well as seal the driveway. Two workers performed all the work in about 2 hours. So I thought just having our driveway washed would easily be accomplished in one hour. However, the young man from the House Doctors was extremely slow moving, and the equipment he was using was a small hand sprayer. I peeked out at him from an upstairs window a few times while he was working, and it looked like he could have been working a lot faster. However, I did realize that the equipment was also a hugely limiting factor. It was obvious to me after about an hour that he was not going to even come close to finishing our driveway alone in two hours. My children and I went for a bike ride around 11:30, and returned home a few minutes prior to 12:00. The young man from House Doctors was sitting in his truck with all the equipment packed up, ready to leave. I was annoyed because I had paid for 2 hours of time, and he hadn't started working until around 10:30, so he was shorting me a half hour. But mostly I was annoyed because he had only managed to wash about 1/3 of our driveway and had not even come close to working on the sidewalk or patio. I told him he hadn't started working until around 10:20, and asked if he would get the equipment back out and at least try to go over more of the rust spots on our driveway. He said he didn't realize he hadn't started until 10:30 and he got the equipment back out and worked another 20 minutes. In the end, he managed to mostly remove some motor oil stains and helped fade the rust stains at the top of our driveway. However, the bottom 2/3 of our driveway were not cleaned at all. I was so disappointed that he accomplished so little in two hours. Even though I purchased this service through a Big Deal sale, I felt like I was ripped off. I did not feel like the work he performed was worth the $69 I paid! After the service was performed, I got on Angie's List to read their other reviews and realized the company is not a powerwashing company. They are handymen. I had not realized this when I purchase the Big Deal, as they were advertising 2 hours of powerwashing. Perhaps their customer service, efficiency, and professionalism are better when they are doing other types of work. I would definitely NOT recommend this company for their powerwashing services."
5,They called quickly after I purchased my Big Deal to arrange a time to come out. The young man who did the work was efficient and professional. Knew what he was doing and kept at it until the job was done. we had more work to do than could be done in the time allotted by the big deal and he gave a good estimate of how much more money/time it would be.
5,He did the work and he had extra time and asked what else he could do. I would use them again if I got another big deal.
2,"We have an old house. We purchased the faucets and shower and had replacement tiles. Approximately four or five had to be changed for the new faucets. Robert came out to do it all. He was very polite and a hard worker. However, he seemed uncomfortable with the tile work. He was pounding on the tiles with a hammer. After the first trip he needed to order an extension for the faucet due to the thickness of the wall. My husband noticed that there were eight or nine new tiles which had been cracked and chipped. He told Robert about this and he said that he wasn't finished even though he had already replaced adjoining tiles. He came back two days later with the extension and installed the plumbing and worked on the tiles. When Robert was finished, my husband noticed that some of the tiles were sticking out or in farther than the others. Also the spigot beneath the faucet was not lined up with the faucet about one inch to the right. Robert explained that it was impossible to line up correctly because of the construction of the wall. We didn't think that made sense. We were not to use the shower until the next day. The next evening we tried it out and black water came out from around the faucet and then more water came straight downstairs through the ceiling to the downstairs bathroom. I called Bob Vecchio and said we needed someone immediately. He didn't return our calls, so we called Robert and he came right over. It turned out that he had attached the faucet to an old pipe and didn't try it out. He redid it and it is currently working. In the meantime we had received a bill from Bob Vecchio for $829 for the work done so far, including replacing 12 tiles. I called him to ask about being charged for 12 tiles (not a good job) and the fact that the faucet and spigot didn't line up. He refused to talk about it and said Robert had explained everything to my husband to his satisfaction. Not True. He never bothered to come and look at the job. He also said it would have taken too many hours to get the tiles right, this being such an old house. He said most people with old houses would have all the tiles redone with ""liftoff tiles"" He was very rude. We decided not to have them complete work on the shutoff valve and ceiling repair as we didn't feel confident they would get it right."
4,"Took long time to set up appointment. Patio looked good when completed. Technician polite,"
5,My mom was here when the work was done. She said the worker was very efficient and offered excellent and cheaper options.
5,"Excellent experience. When the workman were late, they called to let me know. They were friendly, cleaned up after themselves and checked with me as the work progressed. This was another excellent experience with The House Doctors!"
5,"Plumber showed up within an hour of my call, and he repaired a toilet flushing device in our bedroom area. Pieces for this particular toilet are hard to find, but the House Doctor plumber did the whole repair within an hour."
5,"The post was on a porch that had been replaced some time back by the House Doctors. It turned out that the roof of the overhang was empty inside. A new ""panel"" had to be added to the overhang to secure the post."
1,Had to call twice before calls were returned. Finally got a call back and they said they would look at my driveway for a quote on re-sealing and leave estimate in my mailbox. No estimate ever given.
5,I was going to have the light replaced so I could have brighter light... but the electrician said we could just use a different wattage. I have used this company for several years. The tech (Rob) was very prompt and the service was great.
5,"They were absolutely fantastic! He arrived on time, went out of his way to protect the rooms from dust, cleaned up after and the work was great. We would definitely use them again!"
5,"We have some moisture in the attic, and a hole in the drywall. Mark comes on time, and did a wonderful job. He's very professional and efficient. He fixed the drywall, and even helped to spray bleach on the attic to prevent mold. We would definitely recommend it. Besides, before the job, we communicate with Bob over Angie's List. He's very helpful. A very respectful company and we highly recommend it."
5,They did a great job! The house smelled great when I got home from work. They wiped down all the surfaces in the kitchen and took care of the dishes. Folded laundry in the bedroom that was left out and organized the dresser tops. The kids rooms were organized and cleaned as well. They took care to use a vinegar solution on the hardwood floors which was greatly appreciated. Definitely planning on using them again.
2,"The first thing I was told, before beginning, was the area I was most concerned about, would probably not come clean. I expressed my disappointment in this, and that area actually did look pretty good. There are several other areas, two that are very obvious to me, in the front of the house, and both of these areas did not come clean. When I asked about these, I was told that was as good as he could do. I showed him, the one area that I could reach easily that I could get it clean, which I proceeded to do. I have cleaned these areas in front of the house before. He proceeded to show me in another area on the side of the house that if he put the hose almost touching the siding, it would take the paint off, and it did. There are other areas that are still dirty, and are difficult for me to reach. I have had my house Powerwashed before, and have been completely satisfied. Not this time!!! I do not feel this was a good deal!"
5,The only reason I would not use them again is that they were too far from where I live. The gentleman did a great job. I thought it was expensive but I really have nothing else to compare it to.
5,It was really good. They did an exceptional job.
5,Very well! Contractor actually beat me home to do the work was about 15-20 minutes ahead of schedule. Was very professional went right to work and completed the worked quickly. He cleaned up and took all trash to garage as requested. I found some other needs that I am going to call again to get their assistance. Thanks for a great job.
5,"They were a little difficult to get hold of and scheduled. Not terrible, but a little difficult (don't bother with their email) but once they were here they were great. I should also say nothing I needed done was an emergency. Jim came on time, cleaned up as he went, and was very professional. His carpentry was very good. We had a problem with the door and called back. They were very responsive and quickly returned to correct the issue. We will definitely use them again."
3,Not a good experience.
1,"I scheduled a time for them to come and do the work, but they didn't show up. I have been calling to confirm the date, but they have not gotten back to me. I scheduled in May and they weren't able to get to me until Aug, but they never showed up or called to tell me they were not going to be able to make it."
5,The fellow (Mike Rosipko) arrived on time and did all the prep work. He then crafted a beautiful wood gate for my yard. It was exactly what I wanted and needed. It was all done quickly and perfectly. He then hung an item for me (that I could NEVER have done properly). I would use this company again. I was so impressed by the efficiency and quality of the work. Mike was super and had really good suggestions.
1,"The House Doctors wanted to charge me additional prices and I felt they should have been able to do the job within the 2 hours that I paid for. I wasn't home when they did it and when I came home I couldn't tell where they stopped. They didn't do the whole job but I couldn't tell where they had done the job. I wasn't able to tell which part was clean and which part was dirty. They told my son they used water instead of any kind of cleaning agent so I'm glad I didn't pay the extra whatever they wanted per hour, 100 and some dollars. Their hourly rate was too high and I just felt it was a scam. I'll give you 2 hours for $69 but it's going to take 2 more hours and it's $169 or whatever they were going to charge per hour. I don't recall having any problem with The House Doctors' punctuality."
3,"First off, let me be clear that the service professional that came to my house was very nice and did the best work he could with what he had. I am pleased with what he did, but I paid for 3 hrs of work and he left after 1.5 hrs. I am however, extremely disappointed with the manager's, communication, responsiveness, and overall way that he does business. I purchased the coupon in early May and was actually interested in receiving a quote from them for additional work, however, after several phone calls over a 2 week period to the house doctors, someone finally returned my call while I was at work and left a slightly nasty voicemail stating something to the effect of ""if you don't call me back today by 1:30, you won't get scheduled for a couple months."" I am a nurse and not permitted to carry my cell phone with me during the day and after more than 2 weeks of in-returned calls, I certainly did not feel it necessary to take time away from my patients to check for messages. I checked on my lunch break at 2:15 and called the manager back. He proceeded to schedule me for July 12th, regardless of the fact that in the meantime, we actually had some damage occur to our living room ceiling that needed repaired in a more timely fashion. He asked what we would want done and I replied, ""well, if it's not until the middle of July, I'll probably just have you do cosmetic work and I will find someone else to do what I really need done."" His attitude was very ""oh okay, sounds good, see you on the 12th"" with no apology for the late call, however he did offer an excuse, stating ""we've been really busy. I've sold over 200 of these coupons."" This truly makes me want to stop using Angie's List, at least not even consider a coupon or deal, knowing that providers do not put a reasonable limit on the number sold to be able to serve the customers that actually purchase them. Final note, I asked the scheduler on the phone if they would come do an estimate and he said that they would do an estimate day of service for any work above the budgeted hours (which is not what I wanted, but I truly didnt want any work from them at that point, let alone any additional work, so I didnt push it). I then asked if there was anything that I needed to have for the serviceman when he came to the house and the reply was ""no, he'll have everything with him."" Upon arrival to my house day of service, again, the gentleman that came was very polite and did his best, however he immediately asked me if I bought drywall mud. I told him ""no, I was told I didn't need anything."" The guy only had joint compound with him and he made it work, however, the corners are no better than they were before and I had to do all of the finishing work because the compound had to dry for 24 hrs before being sanded. If I had known that it was only going to take him 1.5 hrs to do the work, #1, I would've run to Home Depot to get the stuff that he actually needed and #2, I would've found more work for him before he left. I was planning on painting my whole house, he could've prepared all the walls for me in that amount of time. Overall, it was a waste of $99. I could've dine the work that was done easily on my own for a lot less money and possibly even better quality because I would've used the right materials."
2,"On May 28, an electrician arrived from The House Doctors and put in the new line (it was an extension cord), installed the camera (did a very nice job with it) and installed the motion-activated light on my back porch. He said I needed a new kitchen faucet and a new ceiling fan and that he didn?t have time to do the other jobs. (This cost me $470 and I had to take the day off from work.) When he left, I thought the electrical line and the security camera were ready to go. For the next month, I had nothing but trouble with the security camera; it kept going on and off and wouldn?t record anything. The security company was very patient with me as I made many, many calls to them to help me get it going. We, of course, thought that my cell range was the problem so, as advised, I bought a second router for over $100. My brother then discovered that the line put in on May 28 by The House Doctors was dead. After playing telephone tag for a while, they finally made an appointment to send the electrician back to see why the line was dead. He came back on July 9. Since I had to take another day off from work, I took advantage of the time at home and asked him to fix the dead line; install a new porcelain light fixture in the basement; and re-screen the back window while I was there. After a couple hours, he told me he fixed the line and that if I had any more trouble with it, I should call the garage-door-opener company that installed the original box. He also installed the light fixture in the basement and re-screened the window. (This cost me $250 and another day off from work.) The camera continued to go on and off and did not work properly at all. The security company told me to send it back and they sent me a new camera. Meanwhile, my brother discovered that the electrician had run the ?new line? into a line that switched on and off with the garage lights that I controlled from my house. I had to leave the lights on 24/7 until I could have the electrician come back to ?fix it? (again). I contacted The House Doctors about this on July 25 and a new electrician was sent out on August 1 (I had to take two hours off from work). His first comment was about the extension cord used by the first electrician. (The first electrician had told me that adding conduit would be much more time-consuming and costly, so I agreed to the extension cord.) The second electrician worked on it for about half-an-hour and said it was fixed. I tested it (I thought) and it seemed to work but after he left I turned the lights on and off from the house and the camera stopped working. I immediately called him and he came right back. After a minute or so, he said he finally realized what was wrong. (It had something to do with the relay in the box installed by the garage-door-opener company.) Once he ran the line through the relay, the camera worked perfectly. (I hope I worded all this correctly ? I?m electrically challenged.) The owner of the company called that night (August 1) to ask me if I was happy and that he wanted to ?put a smile? on my face. I was smiling until he added, ?You know, I could charge you a little for that work today but I?m not going to.? Seriously? After two months of aggravation for me (and my brother), not to mention the expense and time involved (two more visits by electricians and another ten hours of vacation time; the unnecessary purchase of a second router; numerous phone calls to the security company; uninstalling the first camera and shipping it back; and installing the second camera, I was astounded that the owner would even hint that I should pay for the less-than-one-hour visit by the follow-up electrician. This job should have been done correctly the first time the electrician came out on May 28. After all this, none of which was my fault or the fault of the first or second security camera in any way, the son of the owner accidentally sent me a copy of an e-mail he intended for his father in which he referred to me as ?a pain.?"
2,"After filing a complaint with Angie's List on 7/8/2013 about a repair to brick molding (which was coming apart, developing black mold, and leaking water into my house) around my sliding glass door, I received a call from Bob Vecchio from the House Doctors on 7/12/2013. He indicated that he wanted to ""make it right."" However, he would not be able to do the job himself as he no longer does his company's jobs due to the fact he has had a double knee replacement. However, he would send one of his guys to fix the work, and he would get back to me to schedule an appointment. I would have preferred to hear that he or his son would come out personally and fix the job on a weekend so that I wouldn't have to take more time off work, but that was okay as long as the job would be fixed right and in time for the outside of my house to be painted. During the week of 7/15, Bob and his son, Mike left messages for me. However, due to a family emergency, I was unable to call back until 7/22. On 7/22, I returned Mike Vecchio's call to schedule the appointment to fix the brick molding around my sliding glass door. At this time, he indicated that he would send the same individual who did the initial work. I expressed concern and asked for someone else since this individual didn't repair the job properly the first time. Mike interrupted me and said it would be fine. He said he talked to his guy, and they discussed what should be done. This surprised me since Mike never saw the work (even though I offered to provide pictures in a previous voice-mail). I went ahead and scheduled the appointment with him for the next morning since I needed the work to be finished before my house was painted on 7/24/13. Approximately 30 minutes after my call with Mike Vecchio, I received a call from a 2nd carpenter who was referred by my painting company. During the week of 7/1 when I didn't hear back from the House Doctors, I contacted my painting contractor for a carpenter referral since my house was originally scheduled to be painted the week of 7/8. However, due to rain, the painting did not start until 7/24. The carpenter said he could stop by and look at my job in the next half hour as he was finishing up another project in the area. I agreed to have him look at it. When he and his partner saw the molding around my door, they explained that the job was not done properly and that the molding would have to be replaced. They said they didn't understand why 1/4"" round molding was used at the top of the brick molding to keep water out. Instead, they suggested using flashing. Also, one of the corners of the molding was not secured causing it to come apart. They also indicated that there was way too much caulk used around the trim. It was quite messy. However, despite the excess caulk, water was getting in behind the door and getting into my house and causing black mold to appear on the outside brick molding and the 1/4"" round molding. They explained they would need to replace all of the molding around the door, scrape off all of the caulk, and install flashing under the siding and over the top of the molding. Labor and materials would cost $250.00. Since I had confidence they would do the job correctly and since they could do the job the next day, I agreed to hire them. I immediately called Mike Vecchio back to cancel my appointment. When I got his voice mail, I left a message indicating that I was hiring someone else to complete the job and the reason why. I also mentioned that I'd like to talk to him or Bob and request a refund for the initial labor and materials. However, I did not receive a call back. I only knew that he must have received the message when no one showed up the next day. On 7/26/13, I called Bob Vecchio to follow up and request a refund. Bob returned my call that afternoon. He seemed angry, and he told me that he didn't think I was being fair since I did not give his company the opportunity to fix the job. I tried to explain to him that I was willing to do that. However, when the 2nd carpenter indicated that the job was not fixed properly and since the House Doctors were only willing to send the same individual who did the job improperly the first time, I preferred to have someone else do the work. Unfortunately, Bob interrupted me and talked over me multiple times. When I requested a refund of $167.58, Bob said he would offer me a refund of $125.00 because he felt the materials probably didn't need to be replaced. However, he had never seen the work and wasn't interested in seeing pictures that I offered to provide. He said he would refund me $125.00 if I changed my review on Angie's List. The House Doctors has since refunded me $125.00. the total cost of my repair was $292.58 ($250.00 to the 2nd carpenter and $42.58 paid for some of the materials for the first repair). At this point, I'm grateful that the repair is now properly fixed, looks great, no longer leaks, and that I received some of my money back to defray the cost of the total repair. Since Angie's List does not allow for half grades, I had to rank my experience as a D for the grade above. However, since I received a refund of $125.00, I would say that my overall experience was more like a C-/D."
5,"I did use The House Doctors and that one turned out excellent. They were neat, clean and efficient, I have no problems whatsoever. They even suggested areas that needed to be repaired and fixed those also."
5,"Robert from The House Doctors did an excellent job, was professional and got the job done in a timely manner. I needed the work done by a certain time and it was done well in advance of my deadline."
5,"They did a terrific job locating a part for a very old dishwasher, then modified it to fit. I would definitely use them again!"
5,Did a replacement of a damaged ceiling and painting with trim added and repair of paneling in family room. Replaced drywall in living room and hall. Patched cracks in bedroom. Installed lighting in family room. On time all the way cleaned up as they went along and entire job done within 1 week.
4,It was good. I never saw them do the work. They completed everything while I was gone. It was not as thorough as I would have wanted.
5,"He was ok. He did a good job but, he was a little slow."
5,Went well. I happened to have some extra wall anchors to secure handrail into wall.
5,"Bob is always very responsive when I contact him. The guys he hired were friendly and called the day before to let me know they were working in the morning. They arrived as planned and worked around the cars in the neighbor's drive to remove ivy. They tried to match the tuckpointing color & talked to me about possible future repairs for the steps. They went through thorny berry bushes to get to the old wood fence to take it down. They then put all the debris in the truck. They were friendly, courteous, efficient and thorough. They checked with me on every job. I would hire them again and will hire them again. They are the best!"
5,It went fine- I was not at home when they did the work.
5,"One of the crew was sick, but came anyway since I was having a party in a few days. Did forget their rags, but ran out and got more. Very good attention to detail when cleaning. I was pleased."
1,"Everything went extremely well, in fact, it went so well that I have decided to take my time a write a review. I very much enjoyed the responsiveness of The House Doctors' automated pre-recorded answering service. It literally answers without hearing that phone tone... on all 4 lines listed under contacts. Super cool! Oh yeah, the recorded voice quality is simply stunning. So I left several messages... and left several more two days later. Only about two weeks later since my initial contact I had a privilege to finally play this interesting game called ""phone tag with Bob"". I really don't have a job nor do I have life so I simply sit on my couch and desperately wait for that precious call from Bob to establish a direct line of communication and finally... it paid off. Bob called my cell and I picked up! Hurray! The arrangement was made for some one to stop by and inspect the problem. Unfortunately I wasn't home (I don't work... remember?!) but my wife happened to be home. Now Im quoting my wife: ""some guy of barely legal age to work came out and took photos."" Well, a week and a half later since the ""very young man"" took photos, Bob left a voice mail stating the estimate was sent. You know Bob, I appreciate the effort, but at this point, I kinda started to like my leaking home and the damaged dry wall along with the water damage in my 3 car garage ceiling."
5,"Jim came here for three days. In 90-degree heat, he worked diligently at scraping and painting the garage. When a sudden rainstorm came, Jim just waited it out by sitting in his truck. We asked him to come inside the house for ice tea during the rain, but he preferred to wait in the truck. He was very neat, polite, and pleasant."
5,Good he did a great job and provided pointers
4,"Getting to the first visit took some time so I gave them an average grade for responsiveness. Once the repairman arrived, everything went very well. He did a very good job and cleaned up well. He did the ceiling touch up, too."
2,"I called for a deck repair estimate. I received a call from Bob who said Mike would call and set up a time to provide estimate. Several days later than stated, Mike called back. We made an appointment for the estimate. He was on time and professional. He called back with the numbers and description of work 5-7 days later. When I called and said I wanted to schedule, he said he would email a contract. Didn't hear from them for weeks. Never received contract, just another phone call asking if we received the estimate. By this time I had contacted someone else and sent in their contract."
5,"It went amazing they not only did everything we asked, they also took initiative and cleaned or suggested ideas not even thought of. They really go above and beyond and take their jobs ver seriously. I will call them in the future again and again!"
1,Called twice (approx. one wek between calls). Never did hear back from anyone.
2,"I don't remember the details or when these people were here - a couple of years ago. They came and looked around for our water source. We are on a well and have limited water pressure. they should have asked about our source of water before they came- We would have never ordered the service, knowing they would have to use our water. i thought they brought their own water in a water truck. The job done was most unsatisfactory - I just wanted them to leave before they used up our water. Terrible idea to hire this company."
1,We have found services elsewhere.
2,"Three teen girls arrived who looked as though they had been told at gunpoint that they had to clean this house. I had talked to a mature sounding woman and thought she would be coming. They sped through the two story house in two hours and then told me I owed them for 3 hours because they thought 9 am to 11am was three hours: 9, 10, and 11! I paid them for the 2 hours from 9-11 am. Someone had set a bathroom cleaner bottle that contained bleach, sitting on the hardwood floor in the hall that left bleach marks on the wood. Someone who worked upstairs picked up a throwrug without cleaning it and dumped it on a built in bookcase and left it there, dirt and all. They barely cleaned inside the kitchen cupboards. I had left them there to run a few errands and when I came back, the whole house smelled like they had spilled a gallon of air freshener throughout the first floor. There were one or two ants on the floor due to heavy rains that year, so they told me the house was infested. That's a lot of money to pay for some excessive air freshener and 3 surly teens."
5,"GREAT! When I explained to the owner that the front door issue had a safety factor, he happily expedited my service call. The gentleman that came out was extremely competent and very nice...he handled all my jobs quickly, and was professional throughout. He cleaned up after himself, and did not go overtime (as this was 2 big deal coupons). The front door issue was particularly tricky, and he made it work. Will use again! THANKS!"
4,"The House Doctors - Bob Vecchio - followed up on our calls and rescheduled the pressure wash. He sent two of the nicest young people who spent the time and took the care to do a great job on the house and garage. And this was on one of the hottest days when the temperature in the afternoon was in the 90's and probably felt like over 100. In fact, I would have understood if House Doctors had called to reschedule on a cooler day, just to look out for the safety of their people. At any rate, they did a super job. My husband was especially excited by the job they did pressure washing the back of the garage where some green algae had been creeping up the back wall. It looks like new again. We are very appreciative!"
5,"Did a very good job power washing front walk and stone path around garden area. Courteous and professional. Did not call before coming over to do the job, luckily I was home."
5,They were fine. They were very helpful.
5,"Everything was fantastic! Quick reponse from the first phone call - they promptly returned my phone call and scheduled an appointment time within a week. Robert arrived on time and promptly knocked out my entire to do list in record time. Before finding the The House Doctors on Angie's List, I had a hard time trying to find anyone to simply return a phone call. The House Doctors are now in my speed dial and will be my first call for upcoming house projects. I have already shared their information with my friends!"
1,"I purchased a 2hr. certificate for Handyman work from the House Doctors on April 27, 2013. Called to schedule an appointment the week of June 10th. Reached the House Doctor and was given an appointment for June 17, 2013. On 6/17 I received a call from Bob Vecchio stating that his handyman was on his way but en route the truck broke down and he would have to call a tow truck for service. He stated he would call me that evening (6/17) to re-schedule. However, he never called. I called back again 6/18, 6/20, and 6/24 with no luck of a reply! As of this day (7/8) I have not received a call back to re-schedule an appointment or been offered a refund of $89.00 for the purchase of the service certificate!"
1,"I needed to have the wood trim around my sliding glass door replaced and also there was a section of the facia board that needed to be replaced as well. They came out and did the work, things seemed to be fine. The wood, where it is connected, is coming apart and water pours into my home when it rains. I contacted the company to come out and fix the issue and left a voicemail. I never heard back from them so I called the second number that they have listed and again got no response, I have left messages on both numbers now. I am needing to have the issue fixed before I can have the exterior of my house painted. The wood trim around the door still needs to be stained and painted before the exterior painting can be done."
1,"I have tried twice to reach them and each time have gotten their answering service, but they've never returned my calls or messages. I won't be doing so anymore, I'm getting a refund."
5,Repairs were excellent. Good craftsmanship.
5,"They did a great job! The house that they worked on is around 100 years old with a lot of wear and tear throughout. Because of the age of the home, each time the crew would try to accomplish something, they would find further problems below the surface. They handled each situation with skill. They are very courteous and professional. The price was very reasonable considering the amount of work and age of the home. Lastly, I would like to comment on their ability to get the job done within the time frame stated. We would definitely use them again."
3,"The repair was fine but I was not really happy with the pressure washing. They showed up, and they were fine. The fellow finished it in two hours and my complaint is that I could have done the same with my host. He basically just host down my deck."
5,i knew if I hired Bob he would come to water the flowers and garden while I was away. Of course he did. He did not charge me for a weekend when it rained. I chose Bob because he is reliable. I can count on him.
5,Went well. The couple that came out were very friendly and professional.
5,"I had lost faith in all handymen, until Bob came to the rescue!! I have been readying my house to sell. This meant doing a number of home improvements, most of which were simple enough to tackle myself. However, when it came to replacing some cracked grout in my ceramic kitchen floor, I wanted someone with more expertise (and a greater ability to spend all that time crawling around on the floor!!) I called a number of different handymen services. Some of them didn't bother to return my calls. A couple actually came out to see the job and provided quotes, but then wouldn't return calls to schedule the job. When I called Bob and explained the situation to him, he jumped to action. He was very understanding of my time frames and promised that he would not abandon me like the previous companies I had called. Bob stayed in contact with me, calling me multiple times while he was working to schedule someone to come to my home. Within two days we had an appointment scheduled for the following Sunday. He called again on Saturday morning to confirm the appointment. Later on Saturday, I received a call from the actual handyman that was coming to repair my grout, Robert. Robert asked if it would be possible to stop by that evening to look at the job so he could make sure he had everything he would need the following morning. I agreed. Once he arrived and assessed the job, he provided a quote on the spot. We started to talk about the schedule for the following morning. When I mentioned that I had a family get-together to celebrate the return of my nephew, he offered to do the job that evening so I would be free for this important family event. He left to get his tools and 30 minutes later started working on the grout. He removed all the damaged pieces and regrouted the floor. Two hours later, the floor was done, cleaned up (as clean as you can make a freshly grouted floor) and I couldn't have been happier. The job was done less than a week from initially calling Bob, and for a price that was better than the two quotes I had received. My faith is restored!!"
5,"They called me to schedule a date/time and asked in what order I would like things powerwashed so that they made sure to get what I wanted done in the amount of time the Big Deal allowed for. The employee arrived on time and checked in with me at intervals to again make sure he did what I wanted in the allotted timeframe. Even more was done than I expected, and he did a good job. I am very pleased with the service received for the price paid."
5,It was delayed a couple days but he called me and explained which I appreciated. The work was done in a timely manner and the work was very well done.
5,"The work was done well and professionally. This service was scheduled after several phone calls, a slight delay apparently because it was a busy time of year for this service. The work was done very well, and the technician asked questions about what was wanted as needed. He even said that there was some time left in the hour we were paying for, and was there something else he would like us to do. He then cleaned the concrete area near the front door at no extra charge."
4,"It was an okay experience. The second story above my garage could not be reached. The rest of the work was fine, but I should have been asked beforehand about the second story above the garage."
1,they did not show up they do not call back. they take the money and run
1,"It went terribly. First, they arrived about 1hr and15 minutes late. When I said ""You guys are late! I was expecting you about an hour ago"" their response was ""yeah....."". Then, I asked them to clean. They did a terrible job. I continuously had to point out areas that they missed and had to remind them not to take short cuts. They didn't even move the rugs I have on my kitchen floor to vacuum/mop underneath them!! They kind of work they did was absolutely appalling."
5,The work was efficient and professional. Work was well done.
2,"They ended up showing up a month earlier than scheduled. They ended up sending a guy out who couldn't do the job that was required. He was very courteous and did a good job with the work that he did. However, I hired the company to wash the high points of my house and they never brought the ladders needed to do that. I ended up calling the business to let them know, and I still haven't heard back in week."
5,"Responsive to my requests. Went well. Two workers budgeted their time appropriately. Cleaned a stove top hood which required climbing on a ladder, countertop which I couldn't do. Next time I would specify that i wanted stove top cleaned - which would be time consuming. I didn't specifically request it this time, so it wasn't done. They cleaned my floor meticulously without drenching it in water (wood) and in several areas one of the workers scrubbed the floor on her hands and knees. My knees hurt watching her."
4,A few places not done even though I called them to their attention. some places not swept that should have been
5,They did a great job. The porch and patio look great. They offer great value.
5,"They did an excellent job, they were very punctual and professional. You name it - it's the whole nine yards with this company. I'd highly recommend them and would use them again for future needs."
5,"They were there when they said they would come and they did the work they said they would perform. I didn't have a lot of interaction with them, but it was a fine job and the price was good."
5,"Matt was on time and did the jobs neatly and quickly. Tho I hadn't mentioned the wooden benches there was a little time left and he fixed them. I will use them again for a number of different projects I have planned. He answered questions I had about those future projects, some big and some small."
5,"I purchased an Angie's List Big Deal special offer for this service and they did an excellent job. My advice to others is to call them up and get them in. Pricewise, it was a pretty special deal."
5,"I was very happy overall with the work completed in 2 hours and for the money paid. I wouldn't have believed the difference power washing could make to my deck which was obviously much dirtier than I had anticipated. The north facing siding of my home was heavily stained with algae and looks great too though there are a couple of places where some light staining remains. It may be that power washing alone can not completely remove stubborn algae stains? This is the only reason I gave a B for quality. I have chosen not to rate punctuality due to the circumstances at the time. The work had originally been scheduled for 5/1/2013 but due to a medical emergency within the family the appointment had to be re-scheduled. I was advised that someone would ring to re-arrange within a few days but instead they turned up late afternoon on the 6th and asked if they could do it then. Luckily my husband was at home and he agreed. This was not a problem for us at all and, to be honest, was sooner than I had anticipated."
5,"I rated them A because of the effort they made. The initial contact was fine and a date was set for the pressure washing (with outside window washing by another company scheduled for 3 days later.which had to be rescheduled as well.) But the pressure washers never showed up. Before the scheduled appointment, there were about 4 phone messages left asking what was to be done. I answered all messages, only to get another questioning message a few days later. Annoying. After waiting for them all afternoon, I left them a message that I needed to be rescheduled. The office said I would be contacted. . A very nice lady returned my call, saying they had not come because of an illness and rescheduled the appointment. Before the appointed day, I got another message from the same person who had made the multiple questioning calls that a crew would be out on yet a different day than the one the lady had scheduled. I returned his call and left a message saying his date was wrong and they were expected on the day the woman had set. Needless to say, they did not show up on the appointed afternoon. At about 6:00 p.m. I called the office and left a message saying that if I had not already paid for the service, I would certainly be cancelling them. Since this was the third appointment they had not shown, I was not nice. About 45 minutes later, a very nice 2-man crew arrived to pressure wash the house. They did an excellent job, were courteous,. and appologized for the lateness of their arrival. They said the person who was ill was the scheduler. When that scheduler returns to work, I hope they give her a raise. Apparently she does an excellent job but has no backup. They apparently are lost without her. (The office had called the washing crew at home and sent them to do the house after hours. It is for this effort t hat I gave them an A, since that was certainly above and beyond what I would have expected.)"
4,"I purchased a two-hour handyman coupon on 4/23. I called the company via the phone number on the coupon and left a message on 4/24. I received one phone call back later on 4/24 from Mike with a voice mail asking me to call back. I returned the call to Mike's phone number that same day, made another call to the phone number on the coupon on 4/28, and sent an email on 5/13, but I did not receive a response. I left a voice mail each time I called the company. I requested a refund through Angie's List on 5/17 at which point I provided this review with an initial grade of D. After the review was posted, I received a phone call from Mike on 5/25 and a call from Bob on 5/27. Mike's message indicated that he never received a phone call from me. However, I double checked my phone bill to ensure that I called the correct phone numbers. Bob apologized for the delay and explained there was a medical emergency during the delay. He offered to rectify my situation by offering an extra half hour of work. I returned Bob's call on 5/27 and left a message indicating that I would accept his offer if it was not too late in the refund process. After speaking to Bob, we agreed that it was too late in the refund process to accept Bob's offer. However, he offered to honor the extra half hour if I purchased a new coupon for the service. Following receipt of the refund for the initial coupon, Bob and Mike called to get my work scheduled including the extra half hour The work is now scheduled for 6/14. Jim, the handyman, called an hour before he was scheduled to arrive on 6/14 asking to reschedule for the next day. I agreed to reschedule, and he arrived on time the next day. When Jim arrived, I showed him the rotted kitchen cabinet floor that I wanted replaced. He then went to Home Depot to obtain the supplies using a gift card I had purchased. When he returned, he went right to work. The cabinet now looks great! Additionally, Jim was pleasant and professional, which made for a nice experience. Jim finished within two hours, so I did not end up using the extra half hour Bob offered."
1,"Scheduling: Before I made an initial call, the House Nurses began calling my home and telling my daughter that I had to schedule quickly becasue my offer was going to expire. Once I called and left a message, calls continued to come to my home instead of the cell phone number I left. Since I work during the day, I did not get the messages until after close of business. I got to the point of leaving a message that I would request a refund and find another company if I did not hear back in 2 days.Once I was able to contact the company, scheduling was easy. On the day of scheduled services, I called when no one arrived by 30 minutes after the scheduled time. No call back, so I called again when no one was there an hour after the scheduled time. This time I got a call back from the owner advising that the people coming to clean my home were in a car accident. We rescheduled for the following Monday. This was an inconvenience since I had to then clean on Friday night before weekend guests arrived, but you certainly cannot predict a car accident. On Monday, two workers arrived at 1:15 pm. My daughter was present and kept our dog on a leash in another room with my husband (My husband had a stroke and is not very mobile. We wanted the cleaners to be able to move freely between the rooms they were cleaning, so planned that the master bedroom not be included in the cleaning.) My daughter called me at about 3 pm and asked if there was anything else I wanted cleaned becasue they were just about done. She explained that the ceiling fans would not be cleaned because the cleaners did not bring a ladder. I asked my daughter to go over the list with them and make sure they did not forget anything. The cleaners left at 3:30. Whe I arrived home I was looking forward to see a clean home. Instead I saw smeared cupboards in my kitchen and waste baskets sitting in the middle of the bathroom floor. Light fixtures in the bathroom had not been cleaned or dusted and the doors had not been washedand there were cobwebs in the laundry room and front hall, so the walls and ceilings had not been dusted.. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. I called the House Nurses the next morning and explained my disappointment. Initially, the owner said she had a 24 hour guarantee policy and I could get a refund or she could come back and correct the problem. I asked her to come back becasue I wanted my house cleaned. She called me back a short time later and told me she would not come back unless I paid additional charges. She told me that I was not entitled to six hours of cleaningsince two people came to clean and she did not agree that two people working from 1:15 to 3:30 was less than six hours of work. She told me to write a bad review on Angie's list if I wanted to. This was surprising because I had never had this kind of reaction. I commented on this voicing my surprise that she did not care about negative comments about her business. She told me her business was fine and she never gets complaints and that I should just clean my own house. It was as though I was speaking to a different person. I can understand that someone may not clean to my standards, especially if they are willing to complete the work that was paid for, but this is no way to treat a customer."
4,"The work was fine, he did a good job. He was very quick to respond."
5,The faucet was 13 years old and I just could not turn it off. I called Mr.Vechio and he sent the plumber out the next day (that was the first I was going to be available). All went very well.
3,"On the surface everything looked fine. Upon further inspection, I realized that bathroom rugs were moped around, the shower floor and walls were not clean, the ceiling fans were not dusted, and there is a wall of mirrors that wasn't cleaned at all. I assumed that since cleaning was the job that i didn't have to follow the workers around to make that the job was done properly. Additionally, I was otherwise occupied. I would make it a point to pay closer attention the next time i have house cleaning work performed."
5,"They did a good job. I figure that coming for the very first time, you might want to go above and beyond to wow the customer. They didn’t do this, but did exactly what they said they would, which is fair."
1,I believe the House Doctor is getting too busy and doesn't have the man power to service all the Big deals he is offering. I am hoping that some day he will return my call after four failed attempts
4,Overall it went pretty good. Had to end up paying over the deal I knew it would be over however. I wasn't too happy with the amount of time that it took but they did a decent job. The gentleman Mike Rosipko is a great guy.
5,"We called the House Doctors on Monday, May 13. Bob called back to discuss the problem. That evening his son called to make an appointment. He said they would be near our house the next day, so Jim came in the morning and made the repair. He was very polite and professional."
5,"Although I didn't use them because of timing on my part, they were very attentive to my needs and will use them in the future."
1,"The House Doctors sent their employee on 4/24/13 to pressure wash the front walkway and driveway. The surfaces were washed while it was raining, which made it very difficult to view the quality of thier work. Upon inspecting the job a few days later, I noticed that they blasted away the top finish of my concrete driveway and front walkway leaving the aggregate surface below. I called Mike Vecchio and explained the problem. He was unfazed and insisted that the pressure they used would not penetrate paper or cardboard and that the result was ""normal"". I pressed further and requested that he inspect the job. Mike arrived on May 11th to inspect the job. His attitude was poor and dismissive from the start.....he further insisted that the result was normal and did not admit to any damage despite that fact that I showed him areas that had not been pressure washed which still had the top concrete surface and compared them with the ""after"" effects of their pressure washing job. His arrogant attituted shone thorugh again as he insisted that they were blamess. Mike did not offer a refund or offer to fix my driveway and walkway surface. I've spoken with real concrete experts and they've asured me that pressure washing should never remove the smoothe top concrete layer. The damage done is permanent It will csot me over $500 to have the top surface sealed, as the top surface damage cannot be easily repaired.....will cost at least $2,000 to have a top coat applied. I'm beyond unhappy...........this company is careless and clueless about their pressure washing services. Do not use them.............I may pursure other legal solutions if we cannot reach an agreement!"
5,The House Nurses LLC answered all my concerns prior to the visit. They were punctual. I loved that they brought their own cleaning supplies because they knew which cleaner went with which material. Their vacuum was the high suction model that I have heard good things about. Someone walked in my house UNEXPECTEDLY the next day and first thing she said was Your place looks so clean! I wanted everything cleaned sanitized and disinfected but I also wanted everything sparkly. Her compliment proved my house looked great! Lori is a great listener and I will request their cleaning services again!
5,If you have older siding don't expect miracles.
3,"Overall, not well. I will have to have someone else come and redue the cleaning."
5,This was an overall good experience and we would use House Doctors again for this service.
4,"Purchased deal for 2 hours of pressure washing. Due to volume of business for this deal, vendor informed me that they would not be able to schedule service for 12 weeks. Requested and received refund. Vendor was understanding of this problem."
3,I purchased their spring cleaning deal from Angie's list. They arrived on time and overall did a good job with one big exception. When they cleaned the kitchen I specifically asked that the oven be cleaned only to find that after they left and I went to use the oven they had only whipped down the outside. This has left me a bit disappointed in the service.
5,The work was fine. They did what they were supposed to. They were pleasant to work with!
5,"It was an Angie's List Big Deal that I purchased. I ended up spending an extra $30 because they had to stay a little bit over. They were fine. It was a really hard job and it was tougher than it appeared at first. He had to take extra cuts and measurements on the door hinges in order to get it to work. The only thing I didn't like was that it took longer than I anticipated but that was not their fault. The doors were extremely heavy. The price was in line and probably less than somebody else would have charged. They were right on time. They were very professional. The only drawback is that you need to supply your own materials. I had the materials for this project because I was trying to do it myself but for future jobs, I might not always know what materials to get. I want them to install lattice work with chicken wire but I don't know what to get. They will come and do the work but I have to supply everything. It would be nice if they would come out and let me know what I need ahead of time."
5,The work was adequately done. The work they did was great! We were very pleased with the work.
5,"This experience was great and the response time was immediate. The young guy that did the work was just great. He was very nice and professional. He did exactly what I asked for, and I was very pleased with the work and the level of professionalism. I would use them again and I would recommend them as well."
3,"The person that they sent to my left me in very concern of whether he was a plumber or not. He looked around, I had water leaking through my wall. He knocked out my wall saw all the water, climb down and started to tell me that all of the problem was caused by something in my home. Now they leave and tell me they couldn't do anything until I get in touch with the association of my condo. I did and call them back to get in touch with me just to see if they would come back to fix my wall. I never got a return call."
5,Appointment set up was easy. Showed upon time. Completed work. Did not have to be home.
5,I was well pleased with the work he did. He worked so quickly that I had to find other work to do to make up the 2 hours that I had pruchased.
5,t couldn't have gone better and I certainly do recommend them.
5,Went very well couldn't have asked for mort I wil definitely use them again
5,"Overall, the job went well. I plan to call on them again for other jobs, thankfully I don't need anymore doors hung!"
5,"I love them because they do a great job. If they see something that needs to be done, they let you know. I've been having bird issues and fixing the roof is part of the solution they proposed. Bob (the owner) really listens to his customers."
3,"This coupon was a waste of money. Angie's List did me no services this time around. Unfortunately, I purchased the coupon in March and it is now almost May and I am still waiting for my two hours of powerwashing. First, they took almost a week to just call me back after I contacted them with my coupon code. When they did call, they did not ask me what would be a good time and date; they just told me when they would show up. Unfortunately, they didn't do that either. Understandably, the weather was iffy that day, and some areas had snow. However, my area did not, and it was well above freezing. i might have understood, but they did not call to cancel. I had to contact them and leave a message. Almost two hours after they were to appear, they finally called back. We set a date for the following Saturday. Again, they did not show up. This time, the young man who was to perform the service had family health issues. However, they did not call to cancel and I had to call them and leave a message. Over four hours after they were to appear, I finally heard from them that they were not coming. The owner said that he would call the next evening or following morning. Two days later, I am still waiting. I understand illness, weather and set backs. What I don't understand is the total lack of professionalism with which this company deals with this. Is this the only person who can powerwash in the entire company? Angie's List- I need help here! Work was finally done and done well. I sincerely hope their issues are now resolved and they will be able to get to their customers in a timely manner. Thank you, House Doctors for coming through."
5,"I'm n the process of selling my home and wanted all the little settling cracks fixed. I bought a big deal for $99 for 3 hours of work. The drywall expert sent to my house noticed some cracks that I hadn't even noticed because he knew where to look. After he filled the cracks, he smoothed the drywall so well that the repair wasn't apparent. Then he found the paint that matched each room and touched up the repair for a perfect match."
1,"She took 48 hours to call me back. She then scheduled to come out today, which was great. She told me that she would be out between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. I called her at about 11:48 because they never called me to tell me they were going to be late or anything. She told me that she had a family medical issue going on with her daughter. I thought it was potentially unprofessional of her to schedule to come out to my house when she had this impending medical issue going on in the first place. I decided to get a refund on the deal."
3,"After sale the owner told me that they do not do roofs. So I went for just the siding and patio. After 2 hours of cleaning nothing changed except that the patio looked better,"
5,House Doctors did a very good job. Since it did not take the full time to do the house they also did my detached garage. The house looks much better.
5,"The total experience was amazing! I hope that I will be able to secure a place on The House Nurses schedule for bi-weekly maintenance cleaning. I would also like to mention The House Nurses' superior customer service. First of all, The House Nurses initiated contact the day after I purchased the ""Big Deal"". All communication was extremely polite and professional. My personal preference was considered of utmost importance in selecting the date and time of the appointment. I then received a call to confirm the appointment on the evening before the date of the appointment. On the morning of the appointment, I received a call from Laurie stating that the cleaner scheduled to clean my house was ill. Would it be possible to reschedule for the following day? I explained that, although I am usually flexible, I had already stripped my bed, and my husband and I are both physically unable to lift the mattress in order to remake the bed. Laurie then assured me that my housecleaning would take place that afternoon. At 11:00 A.M., Laurie called to inform me that she was on her way. Laurie and her assistant arrived before 11:30 A.M., just one half hour later than originally scheduled. Superior Cleaning+Superior Customer Service=The House Nurses! A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
1,We called this provider several times! We were given a quote over the phone for $5500.00 to get our two bathrooms remodeled. We asked to have the quote in paper. It has been 2-3 weeks since that phone call with no quote in writing or follow up. We are tired of waiting on this provider and seeking to take our business elsewhere.
5,"We purchased an Angie's List deal for two hours of handyman work and were very pleased. We had two overhead light fixtures in the kitchen that needed to be replaced. The ceiling was very tall and the lights had not been installed correctly from the beginning so it made things a little more complicated. We also wanted them to install a new fan in the bedroom. Nothing was easy with the kitchen lights so when the two hours were up the fan had not been installed. The worker stopped and gave us the option of whether we wanted him to stop or continue and we would be billed for the time it took to finish the job. Because his work thus far had been such a good quality and the price to continue was very fair - we opted to have him finish the job. The handyman, Michael Rosipko was great. The fact that it took longer than we had originally expected was due to the improper way the lights were originally installed. Michael worked very hard and fixed the problems correctly rather than just hurrying to finish the job. He was pleasant and very professional. We could not have been more pleased and will not hesitate to use their services again. It was so nice to have someone that wanted to do the job right. Michael was that guy."
5,"Jim arrived on time and did pretty much everything that I needed done. Although I bought a discount couponf from Angie's list for their services, they didn't make me feel like I was getting less serice. JIm just went from one project to another. Very efficient and I am very happy."
5,"Great job, arrived on time and required no supervision. Work looks great."
5,"The work was done in a professional manner. The workers were punctual, carefully moved and covered the furniture as needed when painting and cleaned up the debris generated by the work."
1,Never returned after two visits to give estimate for siding and door threshold repair.
5,I was pleased that they were able to schedule me as quickly as they did. Mike R. was extremely courteous and went above and beyond to explain the best way to remove the mirror tiles and improve the overall appearance of the wall. He and Mark were able to finish the job quickly and were very careful to ensure there was no mess once they were done. I really appreciate their time and effort on this project.
5,"Handyman Michael Rosipto arrived right on schedule and removed his boots at my front door. I showed him the materials I had bought for the jobs (screen, spine, and weatherseal), and he went right to work. The work was pretty straight-forward, except for the kitchen door leading into the patio room. It had never closed completely right because the deadbolt was misaligned by a fraction of an inch. I just asked Mike to replace the weatherseal, but I heard his electric screwdriver from the other room. I was pleasanty surprised to see he made the deadbolt align properly. The door now closes better than it has for twelve years. He also gave me some ideas for some other little problems that have been bugging me. Overall a good experience."
5,"Overall, I was satisfied with the service provided. The service provider was very punctual. Because I was unable to be there for her service visit, I left a list, per level, of areas I wanted addressed. I appreciated the attention to detail shown to the second and main levels of my home. It appeared as though the lower level went lacking and perhaps this was due to running out of time. I would absolutely use this company again and recommend their service to others."
4,"For spring cleaning, my expectations were rather high. The woman who made my appointment was very courteous and professional. Two very nice women arrived punctually with their own cleaning supplies. They needed no direction and were in my home (less than 2000 sq ft) for 3 hours each (total 6 hours). They did the basics -- dusting, vacuuming, scrubbed floors, cleaned 1-1/2 bathrooms. Although they did this well, I was expecting them to also do small things like dust picture frames, clean a vanity mirror in bath, and a cabinet top in the living room. It was worth $99, but I would not have paid the regular $159 for this service. I would have tipped them if I thought they did more than the bare minimum."
5,the above paragraphs explain the process.
5,Everything was great and we had no complaints.
5,"They did ia very good job, I was very pleased."
1,They couldnt be bothered to even return phone calls
5,"Jim arrived on time and worked efficiently every minute of the 2 hours purchased. His workmanship installing the crown molding in my kitchen is precise and professional, with NO waste of materials. There was a lot of cut work and every angle was cut and nailed with precision. Jim was polite and worked quietly the entire time he was in my home. He cleaned up EVERYTHING prior to leaving. I am palnning to remodel my basement this summer and put in a family room. My hopes are to have Jim return to do the work. Thank you for a pleasant experience. Jim was expected at 10:00 am and called well in advance to let me know of an emergency family situation that would require coming later. He politely asked if it would cause problems for me."
5,The House Doctors responded quickly and came in the evening to accommodate our schedules. It was another excellent experience. The electrician was friendly and professional. The work was completed quickly and he cleaned up after himself. You cannot go wrong with The House Doctors.
5,"I'd had House Doctors work for me before, with a great experience; at that point, they redid my closet, installed a lot of cabinets, and fixed some rotted woodwork in an exterior window. When I bought the Angie's List deal this past week, I got a phone call within 24 hours, letting me know of a cancellation for the next day. When Jim came out that next day, he got right to work, did a great job on all the little jobs I needed to get done. He was very professional and had good ideas on how to get things done. I'd recommend Jim, and House Doctors to anyone."
4,"From the first calling to set up an estimate to the job comlete it was good. They called to let us know they were on he way and were on time as were the phone calls. They stayed on the job, ate on the job and all clean up was good. This work was done on Dad's house approx. 03/23/2010. House has been sold and I don't remember all the specifics. For the work they did for us I would use them again."
5,"It went well overall. Very good service, nice to work with. I would highly recommend Lori and her daughter, Heather."
5,"Cannot sing their praises enough...VERY RESPONSIVE, Arrived right on schedule, extremely professional in every single way! They got the work done fast and not a scrap left in the yard, actually cleaner than when they arrived! What a great team, so friendly and considerate in every single way. Use this provider, I highly recommend!"
2,"I had an appointment for a Saturday afternoon. He was late so I called and was advised that he had forgotten to write the appointment down in his book. He did arrive a short time later. I provided all the materials for him to spray the bathtub. The paint was white, but the tub looks yellow. I'm not sure, but I'm thinking he did not shake the paint can long enough. I could have replaced the tub for what it cost me to have it painted however, I had all the materials to paint it. He did not complete cleaning up the area as well. There was a my bucket left with water and a rag and there was masking tape left on the faucet as well. The invoice was for $25.00 more than he quoted however, I did not pay him the additonal $25.00."
1,I called and emailed multiple times without any response. I decided to get a refund from Angie's List.
5,"She came on time, started immediately and left everything immaculate."
5,"Excellent experience. The guys are very friendly and navigated tough stairs and impossible angles to take out the old water heater and put in a bigger (75 gallon) heater. They were prompt, professional, friendly and cleaned up after themselves. It could not have gone better. I would (and have) used them for an array of household projects. These guys are the best and had to be very patient because I was traveling so much. I appreciate all that they do and they are well worth the money."
5,"He arrived promptly, was courteous and professional, and did a good job.Based on this experience I would hire this company again."
5,"The drywaller from The House Doctors came out to our house for two days at the scheduled time. He was very pleasant, and we were impressed that he's done work for The Historical Society, having been trained by an oldtimer. His work was great -- you'd never know it had been done, which as he pointed out to us, is exactly what you want."
1,"Never got past phone calls. I left a detailed message with my phone number. Did not hear anything for 3 days. I called them and some guy answered the phone with just a hello - never identified the company or himself. I asked if this was the House Doctor and he said yes but seemed confused on the Big Deal offer. At that point I said I didn't have a good feeling and would go elsewhere. I also said he might get a bad report. He said do what you have to do and hung up. Very crude individual, very unprofessional."
1,"I contacted House Doctor after purchasing Big Deal by phone. I left a detailed message with a return number two times. Three days went by with no reply. I called again and some guy answered the phone with just, ""hello."" I asked if this was the House Doctor and he said yes. I asked why he answered with just a hello versus identifying the business. He ignored the question and wanted to know my name. I told him I was calling about the Angie's Big Deal and he seemed not to know what I was referring to at first. At that point I told him if that's the way he runs his business, I'd rather go somewhere else and that he might get a bad review at which point he said, ""Do what you've got to do"" and hung up."
4,"Teh did take a few days to get back to me. I wanted to have some faucets installed and a couple of odd jobs completed. They informed me that they do not do faucet work, so I decided to get a refund."
5,"Began work on Wed., and completed work on Friday. Did a very nice job and cleaned up afterwards."
5,"Had a bit of a slow start with a delay in coming to view the job, but once that was done everything went well. The workman was very polite, neat and I really appreciated that he did not make/receive cell phone calls while he was here. He focused on the job at hand and was finished in about three hours."
4,"Very prompt; met with tenants; completed an estimated and the required work. Tenants were very pleased with work and interactions with the worker. Sent bill upon completion of work, would use again."
5,He arrived on time if not early and was very professional and completed all work that we talked about.
5,"Called for arrangements, came promptly, friendly, tidy. Checked daily on work being done."
5,They did an excellent job and I would recommend them.
5,Work was completed in the estimated time and within budget for materials.
5,"Beautiful job, scheduling was easy. Professional all around. Asked for the same technicians I used before."
5,The technician worked quickly and efficiently. I was very pleased with how quickly I got an appointment. The price was very reasonable. Will definitely recommend them to family and friends!
5,"Steve arrived on time from Pennsylvania, even though the weather was very foggy that day. He analyzed the work to be done and I said the closest store for parts was Home Depot. I explained that Lowes installed the door in 2004. I took a picture and went to them first for repairs but they said they don't repair doors. However, they recommended Angie's List for a handy man and to use treated wood or PVC material for door framing. Steve returned with a door frame kit. He said the material was wood but seemed unsure if it was treated. He repaired the frame which took 4 and 1/4 hours and he allowed me to use a $25 coupon. The caulk had to dry before we could close the door. When dry, I tried to close and lock it with a key using my body weight to push hard but it would not close. I opened the main garage door and was able to pull hard and lock it from the inside. I called and he came back the next day. I was unsure if I was being charged $124 per hour for him to fix it correctly and I was honestly afraid to ask. He didn't say but either way I knew it had to be done. After two hours I told him I had to get back to work. I asked how long would he be? He told me he wanted to make sure it was done right and to my satisfaction. I told him to call me if he needed me and left him to finish. He already had my credit card info if needed and I asked my tenant to try the key in the lock when he was done. I came back on my lunchbreak a couple hours later. The frame was fixed, he cleaned up the area and he was gone. My tenant said the key worked great and there was no other charge."
5,"Rick did an excellent job. He was professional, friendly, and got the job done quickly. I was very satisfied with the work."
5,"Very well done. The technician arrived on time, with all necessary materials. He completed the work quickly, and the work was well done. I first used the services of this company in 2018 when I moved into this area, and have always been very pleased with their work."
5,I had acquired quite a list and really needed help. Butch and Steve were professional in their work and demeanor. They even cleaned up before they left with a vacuum! I am most impressed with their skills and talent but so pleased with their personal attributes. No worries here. They are my go-to guys!
5,"Excellent first experience with Mr. Handyman. Prompt, professional, quality service."
5,"It went great. Ted is truly amazing, he always goes above and beyond. He put the wooden hut up in a very timely manner and made adjustments with the wood to make it user friendly. Then he went on to our roof and walked around to see the shape that our roof was in, all the while giving honest friendly advise. Mr. Handyman of Northern Baltimore County is a great operation from Lynn to Rayne on the phone to the outstanding owner Mark. They are a first rate company. And I am very grateful for them."
5,All work done was excellent and met/exceeded my expectations.
5,"Prompt, professional, if they are going to do a job they are going to do it right. You get the level of service you pay for."
5,Great service and value. Office was responsive and friendly. Technician offered solutions and delivered quality work.
5,"Everything went well. I am very satisfied with the work. The technician Ted came to my home and after brief consultation, got started right away on my job. I appreciated the recommendations he made to save me money and he did a fantastic job. I will plan to utilize this wonderful service for my handyman-y needs."
5,Recently had my bathroom remodeled and Mr. Handyman did a wonderful job updating my powder room!
5,"I had so much difficulty finding a company to repair my siding instead of replacing it. I spent nearly an entire day calling companies, and each of them declined my project until I spoke with Mr. Handyman. They were very responsive to my needs, pleasant to work with, and they didn't care that my project was small. They had it finished within an hour, and I received a one year guarantee on the work completed. They followed up and followed through using email and did it promptly. I had it figured out and schedule for the next week in no time! Overall the entire process was super convenient and I plan on using them again. Highly Recommend Mr. Handyman of North Baltimore County!"
5,It was very good! Just a quality work.
5,"The techs did a beautiful job. I love my flooring. I love this company, easy to schedule,techs are professionals and never disappointed"
5,My technician was awesome. Love my new floors. His craftsmanship was top notch. Completed the project much quicker than I expected and was able to return several boxes of flooring due to very little waste. Will always use Mr. Handyman of Northern Baltimore County.
4,"I thought the price was high but the technician was experience, professional, polite, and efficient, and went above and beyond within the first hour."
4,Job done well but cost too high for type of service
5,"I've always gotten great quality and service from Mr. Handyman. Be it installing an attic fan, installing outside lighting, fixing a plumbing connection, fixing holes in drywall, or even staining a deck, the professionals at this company are always providing great quality of work. I've been using their services for the last two years since moving to Northern Maryland, and I always go back to them for work."
5,"The pantry in the kitchen used to be an exit out of the back of the house. It was half-assed renovated. My beloved Rich, who has done a number of projects for me, came in. Tore out the ceiling finding that above the ceiling was somewhat open to the elements - skeletal remains of birds, mice, lots of leaves all hanging over our pantry food. Rich re-vented the closet, cleaned out the toxic stuff, replaced the ceiling and then built out a new pantry with enough shelf space for everything I needed. Rich always talks to you first to make sure he understands what you want and he offers great suggestions for the best way to do things. During the project he becomes one with it and in this case spent a lot of time talking to the closet as he did the work. It is perfect.. And exactly what I wanted and needed. Office staff is also boffo in scheduling and is very responsive. Please note that Mr. Handyman is a franchaise. This review is for Mr. Handyman of Northern Baltimore County.."
5,Work was performed very competently and efficiently.
5,"It was very easy process, the estimate was quick and easy and done on the phone. The man that came to do the work was pleasant and professional and accommodating. Very happy with the service performed and I will hire them again"
5,"Office staff provided excellent service when I called to get information. They spent a good amount of time answering my questions and explaining the services they provide, as well as the pricing. I received a call when the tech was on his way. Teddy arrived and I went over the work to be done. He told he'd get it taken care of lickty split and he was not kidding. Not only did he perform the work, he performed exceptional work in handling my repairs and went above and beyond to ensure the soffit and siding were secured to prevent them coming off in the future. I look forward to having them perform work again at my residence. So much easier and much cheaper than some of the other estimates I received for the same work."
5,"Spectacular. I can't say enough good things about this service. The people who answer the phones are helpful, prompt, courteous, and very flexible in their appointments. The technicians who do the work are prompt, reliable, and extremely high quality in their workmanship. This is an amazingly high quality service, with a great breadth and depth of abilities. I can recommend them without reservation. Wish I'd found them years ago."
5,"Teddy arrived on time, and was not just a pleasure but a joy to have over, he did an incredible job installing our hut, and worked meticulously to do it well. I am completely satisfied with his work, and that of his company."
5,"Love the work they did for a very reasonable price. Will definitely use them again, very easy to schedule and the work was exceptional."
2,"I did not hire them because the rates are very high. $174 for first hour and $124 for each hour after that and can be billed in 15 minutes increments. They also charge by the hour to shop for your supplies and the is a mark up charge. Also they don't come out to do free estimates, you have to send them pictures. I would recommend."
5,"Rich was terrific. He was going to be slightly delayed, so I received a call from the office with an update (before he was scheduled to be here), which I appreciated. Rich was amiable and knowledgeable, and he made sure to get my input/approval before making any decisions. He was careful but efficient and didn't take longer than necessary. The work actually took less time than the estimate. I would definitely hire again!"
5,"Jay was amazing ..he had to return to finish the job. My building had someone moving out and would not let us use the freight elevator . Granted I did not know that their would be a need for it,so I had to reschedule the work .The building can be very difficult for contractors not on the buildings preferred list. Jay did an amazing job on the doors even with constraints that were out of his control .The job was much better than I expected,very pleased .I will be requesting Jay for the installation of a tub & shower door.I have been using numerous contractors for renovation of our badly outdated Condo .it has been one nightmare after another ..Mr Handyman is so easy to work with .Scheduling is so easy . She is really positive & professional ( I should know her name but it escapes me) I If I had only known what an amazing job they do . I would have used them more for projects I have already contracted.Mr Handyman does a professional job at very competitive pricing ."
5,They did a great job and I have already recommended them to a co-worker for deck repairs.
5,"Everything went great. Rich Weiss was friendly, professional and prompt. I would ask for this technician again."
5,"Mr Handyman and especially Rich again provided prompt, professional, quality service. Highly recommended!"
5,Great!!! Very pleased with the tech. I WILL hire them for additional jobs!!!!
5,My experience was a positive one. The handyman was professional and knowledgeable. The work was done without delay. I requested price quotes for possible future work which was emailed to me the very next day. I would use Mr. Handyman again.
5,"We have used Mr. Handyman of Northern Baltimore County for a number of jobs over the last 9 months. Rich Weiss is my go to guy. What I love about this company is that they will think with me to figure out how to best approach a particular problem. Last job: Environment issues in the house. 70 down stairs and 80 degrees upstairs. Rich closed off some ducts, opened others, repaired broken ones and at this point the temperatures are equalized throughout the house. He also built a set of steps off my dock with a crank to get it up and away from ice. Fixed the downspout, the front door, the security lights, and then talked to me about how to fix the position of the awning on our back porch and options to replace sliding glass door. The latter two project will be done later in the spring. Everything is always done at a high level and I so appreciate the out of the box thinking. I will just keep coming back because the cost is reasonable and I can get a bunch of stuff done at the same time without having to call in different ""specialists."" Hard to find a jack of all trades anymore. The office is also easy to work with and gets back to me quickly to get the work scheduled. Top notch group all the way around."
5,"The technician was very professional, he did wonderful work at a reasonable price. Love my new bathroom, would definitely hire them again!"
5,Would definitely use again. A very customer oriented company. Very responsive when you call. Easy to schedule and liked the flexibility when I had a conflict. The serviceman was on time professional and did a beautiful job!!!!
2,"First of all, i pulled up in my parking lot after going to Lowes to get the caulk & spray paint, He was sitting in his van. So I stayed outside of my condo bldg & checked my mailbox & looked back again & he was still just sittinng in his van, Mind you he was already ten min late, So i went back & started to walk to his van & he got out & said r u Mary? i said yes & he said he had trouble finding my bldg, So when we got inside, i asked him when does the clock start, when he pulls up or when he actually starts the work. He said when he first pulls up. So now, im like 20 min in the hole without him even starting any work. He worked very slowly, Then he said he needed to go out to his truck to get something. He stayed outside for another 15 min or so. I didnt even see him bring anything in with him. Now the price we negotiated at the beginning of the deal, he said he charges $176,.00 for one hour. I did agree to that. He did finally finish the task but the caulking on the sink was sloppy & he left one corner of the mirror untouched. He then asked me if he could have the brand new bottle of caulk & spray paint i had just purchased from the store. I said no, i may need it. But what kind of contractor comes to do a job caulking a sink & doesnt have caulk with him? He didnt think i would have any & then he would have to spend an extraordinary amount of time visiting the hardware store to purchase some & the clock would still be running on my dime, I asked him if he had any caulk in hi truck & he said no. He also assured me he would get the job done within 1 hour so i dont have to spend extra for more time. But, of course, he only did abt 30 min worth of actual work & the rest of the time he was sitting in his van or going out to his van to retrieve something but i didnt see anything he brought back in. So, in the end, i ended up paying $236.00 for 30 min of work to caulk a smsall sink & toilet & spray paint the bottom of a mirror.. Even though they may have been a little high. i did agree to pay the $176.00 for an hour but i feel like i was taken advantage of because i am a woman or maybe its just the way they do business. i should get a refund of extra $60.00 because there was not even enough work to do to take up all that time. He used the time piddling & paddling along just trying to waste time so he could keep the clock running & get paid more. I'd like a refund & wont do business with you again or refer any friends or relatives until this is made right."
5,Installation went well and looks great.
5,"Friendly service man provided excellent service. He definitely knows what he is doing and got the job done right in an expeditious manner. I was also able to quickly and easily make an appointment over the telephone. This company will be first ""go to"" the next time I am in need of a household repair."
5,It went well. The door was fixed as well as the door knob. The door frame was also touched up with paint.
5,"This is the third time I have used Mr. Handyman and again we are very pleased with the service. Their technician, Butch, arrived on time and completed the job in less than an hour. Will definitely use them again."
5,the job went very smooth. the work was done in a timely fashion and very fair price. This is a job that I could not have gotten to due myself and I was glad Mr Handyman of Northern Balto County could assist with this project
5,I highly recommend this company. The technician did an excellent job on my rental property and was very professional. I will definitely call on them again in the future for my rental property.
5,"Technician arrived on time, friendly, completed all work from to do list in a timely manner. They went to Home Depot to get materials which was super convenient and saved me the trip and time, worth every dollar."
5,"Work completed as described, on time and within budget."
5,Everything went smoothly. Everyone was polite and professional.
5,Top notch service will definitely use service again
5,"Service was excellent and very professional. My floor is very uneven from a recent backflow valve installation and he was able to shim the new toilet perfectly. Would definitely hire again, great service and very reasonable price"
5,Loved the Handyman. Easy to schedule. He did a great job and was professional and helpful.
5,"Technician was awesome! Arrived on time, worked diligently while he saw there. Looks great. Great value, will definitely use them again"
1,Stated that they do not do so work only 29 minutes away from their office. Found this very curious response.
5,Very professional. Easy to schedule woth office staff. Great communication by all staff. Punctual. You get a quality job
5,They were very punctual and completed the job within allotted time with no issues.
5,"Light pole base had rusted away and lamp needed to be leveled and secured. Mr. Handyman's Technician, Butch, dug the surrounding area and leveled and secured the lamp with concrete mix. Job took less than 2 hrs and we are pleased with the result."
5,"Received an estimate via email. Office called to tell me Technician was en-route. Tech arrived on time, obtained materials and completed the job in a very professional manner. Finished product looks great. I will hire them again."
5,"It went great. The company is well run, I had specific instructions for when the job should start and they followed through with it. Excellent office staff. We have our hut that we put up each year at the end of the summer. For several years we were using Dick, from this company to put it up. Months before he was going to retire they sent out Don-along with Dick, at no extra charge to show him the ins and outs of putting up the hut. I thought this was going above and beyond. Yesterday Don showed up and did a nice job, he had a shoulder injury so the owner Mark came to help him out. They were both outstanding gentleman. I am very happy to recommend this great company!!"
5,"All the work was done very well and within the estimated time and costs. Both my wife and I are very pleased with the outcome of the work, and certainly would hire this company again for any future work."
5,"Well, will be back to repair fountain"
4,"It went very well. Rich, did a great job. Other than installing the installing the water lines backwards (hot water and cold water is on the wrong side), it went well. Unfortunately, it will cost me in order for them to come out to correct his error. Because it took longer than expected and we went over budget, we can't afford to pay them to correct this issue at this time. We will have to continue at a later date. I have recommended them to neighbors and friends. They are reputable company that will always show up. That's very rare these days."
5,Doug arrived when promised and quickly replaced what amounted to a broken water line. Total cost $164 for time and visit.
5,"I wasn't sure what was causing my baseboard to discolor and disintegrate - worried it was a pipe leak. Mr. Weis arrived on time; was very friendly/professional. diagnosed the issue quickly - ants were eating the molding! I was able to get rid of the ants behind the wall and he replaced the molding and caulking quickly, efficiently and professionally. My experience with Mr. Handyman was extremely pleasant - I highly recommend them."
5,"I had a pocket door that would not slide back into the wall. Rich took time to assess the issue and came up with a minimally invasive solution that maintained the integrity of these 100+ year old doors. The work was complete within 4 hours including removing trim, reapplying the door, putting the trim back, and repainting. Everything was cleaned upon completion. I am extremely pleased and would recommend Rich for special repairs on older homes."
5,"This is the second time I have used this company. My scores tell you pretty much everything. My only complaint is the cost, but they are responsive, prompt, professional, reliable, etc. They do good work. Some advice: I did save money by finding, purchasing and picking up the fan myself, because they would have charged for that."
5,"Very professional and work was of great quality. Definitely helped to clear up a good portion of our ever-growing chore list! The way they structure their rates, it is definitely worthwhile to compile a list of items and have them done all at the same time versus having them come out to complete a single task each time (the first hour of service is more expensive than each subsequent hour)."
5,Me Handyman did a great job fixing a disconnected dryer vent located behind my kitchen cabinet. The work was completed quickly I have not had any issues since. I would use their services again!
5,The technician arrived right on time and worked diligently while he was there. He was very efficient and did a great job! Would definitely use Mr. Handyman again!
5,Doug was a true professional. The quality of the work was excellent.
5,A very Customer service oriented company from scheduling to arriving on time. Technicians are professional and do a great job. I prefer to have licensed workers and guaranteed work.
1,"I purchased a gift certificate for a relative for $150.00. The individual from the company did perform the service. They were prompt. However, the ""minimum charge"" for an hour was $150.00. This was not disclosed upfront to the relative. When I called to express my concern about that the price for one hour of services (given the actual work took less than 20 minutes), the representative told me that this was my relative's ""error"" and actually used the expression ""buyer beware."" Wow. This was after interrupting me and telling me that I was telling them that the company wouldn't get paid because I'd purchased an Angie's List gift certificate. I actually purchased a gift certificate from them directly, so that entire portion of the conversation was irrelevant. Had the representative not interrupted me or had actually been listening, she wouldn't wasted my time going down a rabbit hole. Additionally, the representative mentioned that they decided to honor the certificate even though there was also a problem with the certificate number. The gift certificate came DIRECTLY FROM THEIR COMPANY. I got it from their website. If there were any issues with the number, those issues belong to Mr. Handyman. Up until this point, I had enormous confidence in the companies lately highly on Angie's List. That ended today."
5,"Butch arrived on time, examined the area, then he explained what he needed to do and answered my questions. He went about the job and finished fairly quickly. The area looks great and my husband is quite satisfied and so am I."
5,"I am VERY satisfied. This was worth every penny. Excellent work and professionalism. Thank you, Mr. Handyman (and Rich)!"
4,I believe he reinstalled them better than they were installed initially. They are very secure and have given me no trouble since.
5,very professional; repeat trip to accommodate neighbor
5,"Great! Provider worked in driving rain to make repairs to the corner of our house, and protect it from the elements."
5,"Wonderful! If only our insurance company had been as responsive as the handyman. They also hung our tv on the wall the same day they did the siding!! We will use for all future projects. Price noted included all materials, and he found matching siding for our old house!"
5,It went great. He is fast and polite.
5,"""Great Experience"" The gentlemen was on time--- he explained everything perfectly---very personable and professional. I will be using this company in the near future for other projects."
5,Jay did an excellent job as this was a complicated task. PVC Deck boards had to be pulled up so he could access the bottom of the window. Everything was put back together nicely. Trim was added that made it look better than the original.
5,Better experience than the handy app. No complaints at all!
4,Deck looks good. Only issue was the time needed to complete the job was really underestimated. The company did provide some compensation.
5,They cleaned it out and all is working well.
5,"Better than anticipated. From scheduling with Lynn to having Wade perform the work, we couldn't be more pleased. Well worth the price. Everyone was sincere, professional and easy to work with."
5,"I forget exactly what we had done aside from some drywall repairs for minor water damage, but our handyman was excellent, seams were invisible. He also noticed some worn corners in a few hallways and fixed them up so they're nice and square again. Would not hesitate to call them again."
5,Excellent. From the initial call to set everything up to the technician finishing the job was a great experience. Will definitely be using them again.
5,"I called the company and the young lady was very helpful. She explained the service that could be done, how much it approximately would be, and worked very hard to get a service person out as soon as possible. When there was a cancellation, she called with a possible earlier appointment. Very good customer service. Don arrived early and was ready to work. He was very pleasant and listened to my desires. He was very professional. I was very comfortable with his knowledge and ability to get the job done. He completed one job and went right into the next. I would definitely use this company and its service again."
5,"Mr. Handyman and specifically Jerimiah, couldn't have been more professional or done a better job. We are completely satisfied."
4,"Mr. Handyman (Dick) arrived about 10 minutes late, which wasn't a problem. He was very professional and polite. My issue isn't with the services provided, but the estimate and perhaps the type of work (not the handyman's fault, but the saleswoman). The cost is $154 the first hour and $104 each additional hour (in 15 minute segments). I provided photos of the workspace as well as measurements. I stated there were 6 large sections and two smaller sections, but the handy did not receive the correct work statement before arriving. The salesman estimated the work (based on measurements and photos) to take 3-4 hours. It took over 5 hours and that was with my husband helping and us doing some of the clean-up afterwards. Materials provided cost $140, so the total for labor and materials came out to $710. It was about twice what I expected to pay to have the work done. I thought the work would include a tracked screen system or something, but it was cut and stapled screen and the trim, when replaced, hid the seems and work. That's not the handyman's fault either, and I should have requested something specific if I wanted it. We also have to patch all the nail holes now, and do the touch-up paint job. The end result was a very nice-looking screen, but at an exorbitant price for a less-than-polished final product."
5,"The cost depends on how long it is going to take. They have been good at responsiveness. They have been on time. They are very professional. They came out very quickly after I called, looked it over, and gave me some ideas of what they were going to do. Two people came out and they are very nice, friendly, and know what they are doing."
5,"He was punctual and professional. All work was very well done. He cleaned up all project work. He was personable and expert. The one thing i would have changed would have been to identify ahead of time exactly what items he might have needed, as he had to go out to get some things which i did not have on hand."
5,"Our handyman, Jeremiah I believe, was great. Very knowledgeable, capable, and a nice guy too."
5,"The stuff seems to have gotten done. They're really quick. They had to reschedule sometimes, but I don't think that's the same as being late. One of the things that stood out is that they have the appropriate license for the work that they are doing. Because prior to using them, I had used some people that I had gotten through a different set of recommendations, not through Angie's List, and that particular provider wandered off with a fair chunk of cash not doing the work that they were supposed to have done. That's sort of why Angie's List is so important."
5,"I would use again in a heart beat. The price was reasonable, and work was done much more quickly than I expected. Also, I appreciated that my house was left very clean after substantial dust was created."
5,"It went great. Mark was very professional on the phone. He was able to send one of his workers out a day or two later to look at the jobs and provide an estimate. His price was as good as or a little cheaper than a couple other estimates I got. The shed floor turned out great. Regarding the drywall, they went to the trouble of waiting for the spackle to dry, and came back the next day to sand it. Per my instructions they left it like that for me to paint. When I applied the primer, some of the spackle in one area came off. I explained the problem to Mark. He said he never heard of this type of thing happening. He sent someone over who redid the spackle, and even applied primer to the redone area, all at no extra charge. I was then able to paint with no problem."
5,Very professional and on time. Very good!
5,"The price was pretty good. It was very urgent and I inquired from a bunch of companies who didn't have time. They were able to send out a guy rather quickly and got the work done. The settlement happened on time so they were very good. When you call them up, they give you a time slot rather quickly and the quality of the work was good. The work passed the inspection. I think for the small job that I hired them to do, they were very good."
5,Well pleased he got the job done in good time. Very courteous.
5,"Great Job! Well pleased>Tech Don was courteous,went right to work and cleaned up afterwards.Very efficient!"
5,Well! ...came on time...removed door...took it to shop..fixed
5,Wade was on time and so professional very pleased with all the work he did. Lynn was also very helpful and patient with all my questions!
1,"If you have a smaller project or projects don't waste your time calling. They asked what types of things I needed done. I provided an exhaustive list of small projects as examples but said they didn't all need to be done at once and I was most concerned about getting 3-4 outside things done before it got cold. He asked what the prior people who failed to show up to complete a job charged and when I told him he replied ""You don't want me because we charge way more than that"" I told him my primary concern was getting a professional who could do the job properly and show up when they said they would. He spent the entire time on the phone trying to talk me out of hiring them because of their price and then finally reluctantly offered me a full day for $818 over a month away."
5,"Wade was a true pleasure to have in our house, the exact kind of person you have complete trust in and feel comfortable leaving in your house. He showed up on time and ready to work. The first task was hanging a complicated crystal chandelier with a lot of crystals. My kids were so excited that they monitored everything he did. I really appreciated how professionally and kindly he dealt with them, and when appropriate he even let them help. My wife was equally impressed. Wade did all of the tasks professionally and efficiently. We could not have been more pleased. If you are thinking of hiring a handyman, do yourself a favor and ask for Wade."
5,"Excellent! No other way to describe it. On time, quality work, the controlled mess was cleaned up, and a reasonable price. I had two holes in my ceiling from a leak above me. Jeremiah, I'll call him the artist, cut to the drywall to the odd shape of one of the holes. I was a bit apprehensive about hiring someone on an hourly bases. I was thinking the job would be needlessly prolonged, but it wasn't. I was very, very happy. Jeremiah was friendly and very professional. I will definitely call them again. I'm an ex-Realtor so have worked with many contractors over the years. These guys are one of the best. The job took close to 5hrs."
1,When I contacted them to tell them the delivery date I was told it would be 7 days before they could get someone to come out to install the door. I explained to them I has no where to store the door for 7 day since it's pre-hung with sidelites. The didn't seem to care the least. I wont do business with them again. Not to mention they charged me $146.00 just to do the measuring and that was suppose to be applied to the cost for installing the door.
5,"Painless. Absolutely painless. Prompt, courteous and efficient"
5,"He was running a little late, arrived 45 minutes past the 2 hour window but did call to let me know. Did services very efficiently."
5,Mr. White has done work in my home before. He does a very good job.
5,"I was impressed with the provider from the first phone call. Alan knew right away that they could help, anticipated my questions about insurance and rates before I could even ask, and explained the limitations of service upfront. On the day of service, Dick was on time, friendly, and VERY knowledgeable of what needed to be done. He knew what caulking needed to be totally replaced, and what ones just needed spot fixes- all done appropriately. He worked efficiently, and his work was much better than my husband or I could have done. I will definitely be calling them again for other jobs."
5,"I originally submitted an online inquiry on the provider's website but hadn't heard back after 2 or 3 weeks. Because of the reviews here I decided to give Mr. Handyman another shot and called directly. The person who answered (I'm terrible with names) was very apologetic about the online inquiry issue. I explained what I needed (I only had a rough idea since there were so many little odd jobs like hanging a few pictures, switching out some light bulbs, tightening some fixtures etc...) and I was told exactly what they did and did not provide (turns out almost everything I needed they could do except deal with a minor plumbing issue). The person on the phone was knowledgeable about the services, answered all of my questions and did not simply punt my technical questions to the tech who would be coming. I was able to get an appointment for the next morning and was given a 2 hour time window. I got a 15 minute call ahead and the tech arrived on time as promised. We walked through the house and I explained everything I needed. He got to work right away, was extremely professional and friendly, and was accommodating when I added a few small things in the middle of the job that I had forgotten when we did the walk through. He was also able to answer questions about other services the company provides while he was working (I asked if they do furniture assembly and if he could haul away a few pieces of furniture he was disassembling). One stand out for me was that I was sure I would need to replace a screen door because my dog ran through it and I just needed to know what to order or have Mr. Handyman order and install it, but instead of going to the expense the tech said he could repair it (which he did) at the appointment. The hourly rate and the fee for the hauling I found to be extremely reasonable for the overall professionalism and quality of the work. The tech worked very efficiently. I would definitely use this company again once I have a few things piled up on my list (the flat fee of $146 for the first hour seems a little steep if you only have one small thing that needs to be done)."
5,"Initial Contact made via this site and prompt return call. Scheduling went well and they truly worked with me to fit into my day. Wade was on time, assessed the jobs to be done and went about them efficiently and thoroughly. I will definitely use them in the future."
5,"great. first time I had used them and was starting small. will be making a bigger list now to use again. pleasant, professional - very happy."
5,"Ken called to let me know when to expect Don. He arrived right on time, reviewed everything that needed to be done.(I added some things. originally it was to just hang the TV) Then Don got right to work. Neat, clean, efficient and personable We couldn't be more pleased. Will definitely call again and recommend others!"
5,no drama. all went very well
5,"We were very pleased. I called Monday morning and scheduled the visit for Tuesday. After discussing whether they could paint the wood (the trim was on the second level of our house, Ken moved it back a day to give us time to get the paint. Scheduling was very easy and professional. Handyman did arrive on the date scheduled. I had left the office a message that I would be in a training all day and to call my wife if any issues. They actually listened to the message and called her to give her an update. The repair work looks great. They confirmed when they were done and sent us the receipt by tomorrow morning. We would definitely use them again. The only hiccup we encountered is that we were told we didn't have to be home to have the work done, so neither of us took off of work. However, they didn't tell us that they would need access to electricity until they called that morning when they realized it was a problem. Thankfully our neighbor let them use theirs, but a heads up about that would have been good."
5,"The handyman arrived promptly and tackled the varied task list without any issues. He let me know when we needed a specialist (window repairs) and handled the rest in good time. The rates are a tad pricy, but the service was worth it for the short timeframe in which I needed to have the work done."
5,Came same day. Great communication from dispatch. Worked quickly and did a fine job for reasonable price.
5,"I've had this company do work for me twice in the past year and the people who have come have been very capable, professional, friendly and willing to do even the simplest tasks. They've also been honest in telling me when a task is not one they can do, which I appreciate."
5,"It went very well. I was called a half hour before they came just to give me a heads up. The gentleman was very courteous, quiet, just came in and did the work I asked. He was really efficient. And they man who answers the phone when you call to schwdule(Allen) also called back after the work was done to make sure everything went well and I was okay with all the work the handyman completed. The whole process was wonderful. From scheduling, they were very polite, and accommodating to my scheduling needs."
5,"Can't say enough good about them. Fast, efficient, and extremely high quality. You might find others that will cut corners and come in slightly cheaper, but you'll pay more in the long run because the quality will likely not be as good."
5,"Dick, our handyman, was on point. I told him the issues and he got right to work. He fixed all issues we had. He explained everything he did and gave me advice for maintaining the door. I only wish I had more for him. I'll be creating that list and contacting Mr. Handyman again. They also followed up with a phone call to make sure service went well."
5,"They were prompt, courteous, professional and completed the job as well as expected."
5,Overall they did a good job and were at the home for around an hour.
5,"Don came out and diagnosed the problem as some light mold in spots and blistering paint in multiple other spots ( an 8 X 11 foot area). He went out to purchase some materials to fix my problem. When he returned, he taped plastic to all of the walls, in the area he would be working. Put down drop cloths to cover the furniture and carpet. He sprayed the mold with a mold control product after scraping off the mold and blisters. He examined the ceiling for soft spots and weaknesses that could cause problems later (he found none). He plastered the spots that appeared uneven after he finished scraping. Since the plaster was going to take a while to dry. He asked if I wanted to sand the plaster or have him come back and do it. I chose to have him come back. He cleaned up all the protective gear he used. On his return, he repeated protecting the furniture and carpet with plastic. He sanded down any uneven spots and cleaned up after himself. He told me to get ""Kiltz"" primer to prevent any repeat of the mold showing up again. And to go into the attic and spray any visible signs of mold with a Mold Control product to kill any activity there. Don is personable and a fountain of very useful information that he shared freely. When I asked what else his company did, he gave me a flier stating all there service categories by room. Will I use him again? You bet your A**!!"
5,"I have been very pleased with them and I used them twice. The first time the gentleman was here the whole day. He came in at 8 and left at 5 o’clock and it was almost a $1000. But he addressed all the issues that I originally had him come in for. He fixed the leaky faucets in the bathroom, he fixed loose stair barristers, we needed some grouting in one of the showers, he fixed some light fixtures and lot of little odds and ends. They were very punctual and utilized their time really well. I was afraid of paying somebody on an hourly rate for work but these gentlemen were very good. There was never a down time. You never felt like that he was sitting around talking on his phone and he was really not working. I was at home the whole time and following them around."
5,It went very well. I only wish the rate was better. The service though was very good.
5,They were absolutely terrific. The guy was thorough and did a great job washing the house. They were also timely and pleasant.
3,It went well. There are just extra costs that I am unhappy.
5,He is very expensive but he is a very reliable provider on the list.
5,My husband and I were amazed at how quickly the work was completed and the quality of work. Very professional. We will definitely call Mr. Handyman the next time we need work done around the house.
5,"They did a really good job. They were a little pricey, but I am very happy with the service that I got."
5,"I was impressed by the fact that Jeremiah didn't only replace the drywall tape but explained to me his concerns before thoroughly investigated why it was peeling off. He did such a great job of re-taping the area and spackling it that it doesn't need to be painted. The patch he did where he removed the smoke detector is almost invisible even before it is painted. He also took great care in getting rid of the rusted nails in the mortar without damaging the brick and, after inspecting my storm door, explained why it was hard to open at times. Jeremiah knows his trade, was very pleasant to work with and did a great job cleaning up as he went along."
2,First on their website they quoted a free estimate he got to the job he told me everything that I've told him on the phone about the sump pump then he had to go to Home Depot to get it and I didn't realize that I was being charged for that time. They charge $146 to come out and $96 every 15 minutes which was not told to me until I got ready to pay for it then I'll call their office and the person that answered the phone said said if I wanted a cheapest service I should've called someone else I did tell him that I had called BGE home and they quoted me $90 per hour to come out and I thought that they would be cheaper
5,"Superior service, knowledgable tech, They got the Job done fast and the work was perfect. Will use again"
5,"I called to make an appointment, was treated politely and quoted the hourly rate. Owner assessed my job and accurately stated it should take no more than a 1/2 hour which it did exactly. He stated the cost for the job and then we agreed on a date. I did not have to wait a long time for the appointment date to be made. The old wireless doorbell box was removed requiring screw drivers etc and new one put in it's place. Battery operated so new batteries installed. Chime level and music was set then the box was covered (actually the trickiest part.) Then new doorbell push button installed on outside door frame . Required screwing in screws and then attaching cover. Mr. Handyman was due between 10-12 AM and was at my doorstep exactly at 10. He was very polite and personable, answered all of my questions and offered some information about changing the push button battery. Would definitely use this company again."
5,"The cuts were clean, the doors swing perfectly and no damage of any kind was done. They were very punctual and responsive."
5,"I have used Mr. Handyman of Northern Baltimore County for years on a wide variety of jobs- indoor and outdoor, large and small. They do excellent work for a reasonable charge and respond quickly when called. The owner, Ken Dunn, is accessible and fair. The handymen are very skilled, polite and efficient. I am very satisfied with their work and will use them again in the future for big and small jobs."
5,They showed up on time. They fixed everything in a timely fashion. I'd definitely use this company again.
5,They're great. I spent about $134. Everything that they did I liked. We had a book shelf that didn't have a back to it and he put a back on it and he installed a couple overhead ceiling fans and he also put in a sump pump.
5,The repairman was on time. He quickly assessed the requirements of the the situation and was very efficient. It was my first time using Angie's List to find a repairman. It was an excellent experience!
5,"He arrived on time. After I explained what was required, he went right to work and methodically completed all the tasks and the final outcomes all were excellent. He was very pleasant and great conversationalist as well. I was 100% pleased with the experience and definitely will call Mr. Handyman again when I have repairs or improvements that are needed."
5,Work was performed on time and at the price quoted. Area was cleaned when work was completed and to satisfaction.
5,"My experience with them is good. They were professional, friendly and knowledgeable."
2,"The call center took down all my information including a description of the work I needed, which was drywall repair/replacement and laminate flooring installation. The local rep called me back and said they don't do that work, when in fact, that work is listed on their website of services provided. Guess they just don't want my money."
5,"Very professional. Jeremiah was on time, very competent and both pleasant and polite. Very well done. I would definitely use them again."
5,"Jeremiah arrived 15 mins early. We went over the items on the To Do list and he had helpful suggestions regarding an outside tap and the electrical outlet. He quickly cleaned out the gutters before going to purchase additional materials. This took a little longer than anticipated as he had been unable to find the materials he is accustomed to using and had to make another stop and search a bit for a suitable alternative. He had receipts for everything and gave me the option of using the materials he had selected, or not. As it happened, they were all perfectly suitable; he had given consideration to his selections. He moved through the tasks quickly and efficiently and explained everything as he went along. I left him to finish the work and before I got home he had already finished and called me with an update on his time and the total cost. Everything looked good when I got back."
5,"He was on time and was work was very neat and clean. However after he left I did discover one picture that he forgot to hang in my office. Maybe I should have turned it around and pulled it out so he would've remembered. He caulked my basement bathroom entry, hung mirros, my awards, curtain rods, changed the light bulb on my back porch and he mounted the hose reel to my house. I scheduled him for two hours. He's very professional."
3,"Weather played a major issue in the completion of this job, however the first day I was scheduled for work they cancelled on me an hour before. The overall quality of the work was not the quality I would have expected from what I paid. I ended up having to touch up the paint myself. In part this was due to the fact that I was not there to supervise myself. They never came at the time we had set up, either arriving early or changing at the last minute to not coming due to weather. This made me feel less than comfortable considering I was paying by the hour. There was also much confusion as to what I actually wanted done which is in part due to the fact that even though I took off work on three separate occasions, I was never able to actually meet the person doing the work. While I was offered a small discount for the inconvenience I will not be using this company again."
5,"Mr Handyman went fine. The job went well. They came when they said, then they did a good job."
5,"Late Thursday I needed a rental unit fixed up on Memorial Day weekend. I fortunately had signed up for Angie List and had used them in past with great results. Well, Mr Handyman owner, Alan, could not have been nicer. He had a man at my place Saturday at 9am and the work was completed in 2 hours. Paid via credit card and reciept emailed to me. Thanks."
5,Very pleased. Excellent job from scheduling to clean up!
5,"Scheduling an appointment via telephone was easy, and I received email and telephone confirmations. Jeremiah arrived on time, was very friendly and professional, and performed an excellent job. Would highly recommend and will use their services again."
5,"Scheduling the appointment was easy. Don, the technician came on time and did the work promised and later added, efficiently. Spent a total of 3 hrs 15 mts. He was very professional and advised on a couple other items as well."
5,I called on Thursday 5/15 at noon and I was able to set an appointment the next day at 8:00AM! I was very surprised at how quick I was able to get the job scheduled. Contractor arrived on time in uniform with company truck. I explained the job of removing attic stairs and installing new stairs. I had bought a set of stairs that was too small but he was able to frame it in and make it work. All in all the job took a little under four hours. The stairs he installed worked perfectly. The finishing work (i.e. trim and plaster to cover holes) was good but not exceptional. I would highly recommend this company and I would use them again.
5,"Great service, excellent work, wonderful responsiveness."
4,Several different workers. There was a variance of work quality.
5,Jeremiah arrived on the job early and was ready to work. I walked him through all the projects and then we talked about pricing. He was very skilled and all the work was completed looks great. This company is expensive but I think you get what you pay for.
5,"Excellent job. Looks like they have been there all along. Very professional and courteous. Doug called us in for any style, placement decision. Other than that, he knew just what to do and how to do it. We're delighted. Okay, what I really mean, is my wife is very happy, which makes me happy."
5,"Our technician was Jeremiah who arrived at the scheduled time. He was very personable, efficient and skillful person. Several years ago, we had contacted a handyman and wanted several of the things on the above list done. Much to our chagrin he didn't have the skill needed nor the patience to complete several of the tasks. However, he did complete one of the projects we had contracted for him to do. We were a little leery of getting another handyman, however, we joined Angies list and saw the reviews on Mr. Handyman and decided to go win him. Needles to say, we were not disappointed. We will definitely use this company again and would not hesitate to recommend him to others."
5,"They did not keep me waiting. The person who answered the phone was able to schedule me right away - the same day. The technical arrived within the window they gave me. Also, they called just to let me know they were on the way. Both the person who answered the phone and the technican were very attentitive to my needs and were always very professional and courteous. I have never had to pay for more that the first hours. They are not the kind of company that works slow so they can charge you more. I would happily use them again."
5,Very well --- was very pleased.
5,I was very impressed with the professionalism of Allan and the quick response. They were able to do the job on the same day called. The work was done neatly and everything was cleaned up before he left. He did not leave until I reviewed what he had done.. I would use them again. Great job!
5,"prompt, courteous and professional worker arrived at the time agreed, got to work immediately and wored steadily until it was finished. I have used Mr. Handyman in the past and I particularly appreciate such reliable service. All of the tasks are things I could DIY, but it would have taken me twice as long and I am just tired from moving, unpacking and decorating my new home. Selling the previous home was a whole lot of work, too, and after a while, you just get tired and impatient to be finished. I was able to do other things while he took care of my ""Honey-Do List"" and now my husand won't have to spend his precious weekend on it, either. Mr. Handyman does not disappoint. It is pricey, but I am trained as an accountant, and you just have to pay for this kind of service or they won't be there when you need them again."
5,"He was terrific - he did everything very well, needed no instruction or guidance, just the list, and was highly professional. I've used him twice now, and plan to use him again."
5,"He touched up the painting, fixed the exterior shutters, and fixed exterior caulking. I was very satisfied by his work."
5,"Good job. Clean and neat, that was appreciated."
5,"This is the second time I called Mr. Handyman. J is honest, hardworking and does great work. I was pleased both times I used Mr. Handyman and would use them again for sure. They are a little pricey but the quality of their work is worth the cost."
5,"Their first appointment was interrupted by a major storm, but we rescheduled. Their earlier appointment ran late, so they called to let me know, then confirmed that the technician was buying the materials. He came then the owner came to assist. Then they realized that they needed more materials, so the owner went to get them. The job was much more than we expected because the water damage was more extensive, but they got it done. Remaining work to be done by the homeowner is more plaster, sanding and painting."
5,It was excellent. They came on very short notice when I needed them.
5,"Quality work, timely. Made sure I was satisfied with the result and very professional."
5,I would have liked have liked a price to be set before he came. I thought the price was a little high but he did a good job. This is the second handyman I have had who has not given me the pricing before and I will not be doing that again.
5,I called and explained what I needed. They were very responsive and had someone out that da. They took about the time that they quoted for the service maybe a little less. I was very pleased with work.
5,"From the first call in to Ken to the completion of my list of jobs, I was extremely pleased with the work and the service Mr. Handyman provided. The service technician ( I think his name was Doug) was so professional , pleasant and very, very competent. He did an amazing job hanging a very heavy 3 piece mirror that had to be exact in the measurement. He even was able to give me good advice on where on the wall to hang it. It looks beautiful and I am delighted. I had called another Handyman from the norhtwest Baltimore area who is also on Angie's List and they could not figure out how to hang the mirror and came up with a ridiculous plan for tearing out my drywall to do the task. Needless to say, I sent them away (but had to pay them anyway!). So when I called Mr. Handman I was a bit discouraged. But I cannot say enough about the process and wonderful work Mr. Handyman did in my home. I would not hesitate to call them again for any job."
5,"Jeremiah worked efficiently and effectively completed all the tasks we determined could be completed. Overall, I was very pleased with my experience with Mr. Handyman."
5,"Arrived early (which is fine with me), came and surveyed the job and went to get the exhaust fan. He came back promptly and while working pointed out some issues that should be addressed in the future. He found that the fan he bought was too small so he told me he had to go back to get another one but he would be off the clock. Came back and finished the installation quickly and professionally. It was a little expensive but worth it and would use them again."
5,"He was very timely, professional and friendly."
5,All the work with done quickly and very professionally. There were some tasks on my list that were out of the scope of their services and they recommended that I conatct a specialist in those cases; I really appreciated that advice. Just another sign of their professionalism. I would call them again in the future and highly recommend them.
5,"Jeremiah arrived precisely on time. He was knowledgeable and efficient. He understood exactly what we were looking for, and completed all tasks thoroughly. Everything continues to work well, too - always a good sign! We are very pleased with the level of service and professionalism and will definitely use Mr. Handyman again."
1,"Well, he was super nice and seemed to know what he was doing. But, the toilet still runs and the door knob came off in my hand today. So, the $150 or so that I spent on Mr. Handyman was a waste. The two problems that were to have been fixed persist. I called them today to tell them what happened and they said they could come out again. When I explained that it seemed a bit unfair to pay again for the same job, they told me the clock starts at $0 and I pay for the time. So, I said thank you but no thank you. I would call another company. I am out the $ but I don't want to be out even more $ to have someone fix something that doesn't stay fixed. It wasn't as though the repair person told me the jobs were not fixable, But, he gave me the bill, I paid it, and these two pretty simple jobs remain unfixed. I did give them a chance to rectify the situation (one free hour of work would have been called for, right?). I work and I stayed home for the fix the first time; now I would have to stay home again. It was a waste of time and money. I am going to call someone else."
5,"Excellent service. Called this am & Jeremiah, carpenter, came out w/in 2 hrs of call. He was clean, wore company shirt & drove company truck. He evaluated problem, gave me relevant information to make decision for repair. Removed decaying wood, went to store & purchased required materials, fixed fascia sections. He kept me informed for each step as needed. He carried own tools & c,earned up area afterwards. Am very pleased & requested estimate for two additional jobs. Hourly rate can be more expensive than maybe total cost of a ""job"" but am happy to know I can get handy man service since I don't know how to do any repairs myself & it's always been hard to get someone to come out for small jobs."
5,"I rely on Mr. Handyman to maintain five properties. As a part-time landlord with a regular full-time job, I need a trustworthy and competent agent to handle the problems as they pop up. Mr. Handyman has been able to fix, install, repair and replace any problem that has come up, including replacing doors, window screens, downspouts, caulking, laying floors, faucets, leaks, exhaust fans, painting, cabinets, et cetera. My tenants like the professionalism of the handymen and the trademark red van."
5,"Jeremiah arrived on time (actually a few minutes early), took the time to find out exactly what needed to be done, and verified that I had all the necessary materials ready. He worked very meticulously all day, without taking a break. The quality of his work was excellent, and I am pretty picky about details. This company is not cheap by any means, I had been quoted less expensive fees by others, but Mr. Handyman was able to get me scheduled pretty quickly. After experiencing the quality of the work, I would have no problem hiring them again as my first choice."
5,Outstanding job - my tenant made it a point to call me afterwards and describe how great the repair looked. Certainly using these guys again for future repairs!
4,"He did very well. He was on time, cleaned up after himself. I thought the price was very reasonable from all of the quotes that we had received. And almost after a year, the wall still looks very nice."
4,He was very mechanical minded and had no problems with the chair carrier. He wasn't quite as adapt or expereinced with the curtain rod and had to patch up a few mistakes.
5,"I called the company late in the morning. They said they could send someone by the afternoon, which was great because it was the first cold day and the window was just propped near its opening. The handyman, named Dick, arrived within the hour!!!! And proceeded to quickly fix the window, which is oversized and really heavy, quickly and quietly. Since we had about a half an hour of time left (they have an hourly rate plus materials), he was kind enough to hang two heavy plaster medallions and give two estimates on future projects. I feel very fortunate to have found this company and this wonderful, professional and capable workman. Thank you Angie!!!! I will use them again and again."
4,"Work went well. Handyman arrived on time, was able to replace showerhead without cutting into wall but we had asked to replace the handle/tap that controls the water. That required cutting into the wall and replacing the valve along with the handle. The work was done, clean up was good and he replaced the drywall that he had to cut. Good clean up too. A few weeks later we noticed water marks on the ceiling of the kitchen, below the bathroom. Sure enough, we had a leak at the valve that had been replaced. Handyman was prompt in the response, opening the wall again, fixing the faulty valve, returning a week later to make sure all was okay before closing the wall again. They even took care of the celling in the kitchen.. The leak was not large so there wasn't much to take care of. While I was happy with the service, I am not sure where the fault lies for the leak.... was it faulty equipment or work? I don't know. We will use Handyman again. We like the service, the response and the convenience. Not sure if we will use them for plumbing again."
5,It went splendid. I was so happy with the work the provider. I would recommend them to anyone who wants this type of work done.
5,"Jeremiah was a very polite ,courteous, professional, worker. Would definately recommment company"
5,"Jeremiah was courteous, knowledgeable, efficient, professional, and 10 minutes early. Great worker."
5,"Jeremiah was great. He was tidy, quiet and on time. For the sake of my pocket I wish he had been quicker but his work was superior. I will certainly ask for him again if I find anything else that needs doing!"
5,"It went great. Jeremiah explained all the problems, costs and time it would take up front. He asked if I was o.k. with it and he did a great job on the repair."
5,"It went extremely well. The employee was on time, announced the start and completion of each task, clean up after each task and treated the property with the up most care. I will definitely use them again."
5,They showed up on time and were very professional. They did a great job.
2,"I hired Alan Deitch's Handyman company to better affix the front shutters to my Baltimore rowhome. The shutters were already installed, but I wanted two additional screws and holes drilled to affix the centers of the sides to ensure they would not bow with extreme heat or inclement weather. To drill 10 holes in my formstone and insert 10 plastic screws, it allegedly took nearly 3 hours. I have 3 pairs of shutters. They were already up. It took my contractor less than 2 hours to install them originally. There is absolutely no way it took this handyman 3 hours for this work, or the handyman was incredibly inept. I paid $316 for 10 holes to be drilled into my formstone. Thankfully, they were drilled well. I was taken to the cleaners."
5,"I made an inquiry with the provider. Although, I did not use his services, he returned my call promptly and professionally."
4,Very nice contractors. Are always able to come even on short notice. Very honest and professional. Nice to work with
5,It went well. I had a ton of contractors in the house that day and he even helped the electricians by holding some stuff for them while they were also maneuvering under the kitchen sink. Easy to schedule. Called the week prior for Monday service. Hired them for additional work.
5,"Jerimiah, the service technician, arrived on time. He was very courteous and professional. All work scheduled plus an extra job (dryer duct cleaning) was completed in a timely manner. Jerimaih wore shoe covers whenever he was working in the house and did an excellent job cleaning up when he was finished. I scheduled a power washing for my home for a later date. A company representative called shortly after Jerimiah left to ensure that all work was done to my satisfaction. Overall an excellent experience. I will use Mr. Handyman of N. Baltimore County for any other home repairs/upgrades."
5,Jeremiah did an excellent job of caulking the windows of our home. He also cleaned our skylight and straightened our lamp post.
5,"I called to make the appointment and spoke to someone at the answering service. I then received a confirmation call from the company. They were willing to work around my schedule, which I greatly appreciated. I made the appointment 3 days prior to needing services. Bob was very nice. He was efficient and did a beautiful job with this work. For what he did, and considering that we purchased the materials, I thought the price was high. If we had other things for him to do to fill the time, I think the cost would have been more reasonable, but for this, it was too much."
5,"Jeremiah arrived on time, worked efficiently and was very professional. I am very satisfied with his work. He also did a great job two weeks ago when he replaced rotted wood around windows, replaced the post which holds up the porch and caulked/painted the trim and post. Everything looks great! I have used Mr. Handyman of Northern Baltimore County for various projects in past years and have always found them to be very reliable and professional. Quality of work is very good."
5,He painted over a gold wall for me when I was moving out of my apartment. He did an excellent job and I will use him again.
5,"Everything went well. The technician was not the owner, but was friendly and professional. I would use them again."
5,"Jeremiah was punctual and well prepared. He completed the jobs promptly and was very competent. I appreciated being able to get such quick turn around. Called them last Thursday, they had someone here thee days later."
4,"Great communication, good work, did what he said he would do"
3,"I thought that Mr Handyman of Northern Baltimore County was very expensive and they have workers that join and leave the company. Sometimes I have work done okay, sometimes I have them as tacky so I'm very, very reluctant to use the company. They're very quick to respond and I like that, it's just the level of work that you get is not consistent. The price is very expensive. I will probably not use them again."
5,It went excellent. I just left the garage door open and he started to work on it. I would recommend his services to others.
5,"The work was done very well, very quickly, and Alan was exceptional about communicating schedule, price, and progress. The price was slightly higher than another estimate I got, but Alan's professionalism was worth the difference. Would definitely use them again."
5,"Dick showed up at 8:00 in the dot. I showed him what needed doing, we discussed it a little bit and he got to work. When it came to the damp, crumbly wall behind the tiles in the shower, I was disturbed by what was there and concerned that this would entail way beyond what I was expecting. Dick was able to use some quick setting cement and build a ""wall"" to which he was able to attach the old tile. The wall looks great - all the tiles are back in line and in their proper alignment once again. One of the reasons I will use Handyman of Baltimore County again, aside from the quality of work, is the ability to have someone come out on relatively short notice. I called on Monday, expecting it would be a couple of weeks before someone would be able to come do the work, and Ken told me someone could be there Wednesday morning. From what Ken and Dick both told me, this is the norm for them. I appreciated that the estimate for the amount of time needed to complete the work was right on target, despite the bathroom wall needing more attention and work than originally thought and a minor snag with one of the ceiling fans."
5,"They were always prompt, efficient, knowledgeable, and more than willing to offer a less expensive solution. Had I not moved away from the area, I'd still be calling them regularly."
4,"It went well. The basic work was done very well. The only regret that I had was that I was communicating with service person from work. He was great sending pictures by phone to help me choose what I wanted, but when he asked about finishing off the handrails, I didn't fully understand what he meant., It ended up taking him at least an hour longer (thus, cost me more). If I had seen and realized what he was doing, I would have passed on ""finishing it so it looked real nice"". I think that this was my fault for not being home when the work was being performed. And I do intend to use them again for future projects."
5,"My window had received a lot of damage due to multiple massive storms. There was such a huge gap between the upper facia board above the window and the exterior of the house, that water would continually rush in. Since this was a large area that had water damage, the provider assured me that they would be able to at least start work on the area the day they were scheduled to show up. There was initial confusion about scheduling, but the owner gave me multiple choices that worked with my schedule and we were finally able to come up with a great solution. Once the provider arrived, the service tech looked at the problem, and started work right away. He told me that if anything additional needed to be done, they could get the materials that day, and hopefully finish in a few hours. Originally, the estimated that the entire day would be utilized for the work. He was able to assess additional areas tht I had suspected had succumed to water damage, but he noted that their integrity was ok, and didn't need to be replaced. I had others look at the same area (my wood floor) and told me that they would have to rip it all up, and replace it, even though there was no visable damage. It was reassuring to know that I was getting an honest oponion and that replacing the floor was only cosmetic, and not needed. The service tech was able to complete the work in only a few hours, and used ""quick dry"" materials around my window because we were supposed to get a huge storm, and he wanted to make sure that it dried in time. Additionally, he painted the trim around the areas to top it all off! I was so pleased with the work, that I asked him to check out a few other areas and received some suggestions. I've already called them up to schedule anotehr appointment. I saved so much money and time with them, that I will always have them on call."
5,"Super puntual, pleasant, works with you. I had a misunderstanding from the office. Didn't realize the customer has to specify if windows need cleaning both in & out. Plus customer needs to provide cleaner for inside. No problem for Mr handyman. He sailed out, purchased the necessary cleaners (of course we reimbursed him) and got the job done. The windows sparkle (husband said it's too bright inside house ;>) Dirty awning is lovely again. Doesn't spoil your appetite when eating under it. Green algae is gone from white siding. Looks like new. Super10 rating from this family! We'll certainly call on Mr. Handyman again. Gail Frantz"
4,"on time professional had to assemble and adjust the surround to fit fireplace and uneven walls discovered a gape in the fireplace that went to the outside filled the hole on the inside and went outside and filled all holes found. it was expensive because of the time it took to complete, but I wanted it done right and I am pleased."
5,"I spoke directly to the owner on the phone and he was courteous and friendly and got me scheduled for the handyman to come within 3 days. He also explained the pricing and recommended I buy my own supplies to save myself some money. The handyman that came confirmed that that saved me a lot of money. I got a call the morning the handyman was scheduled to come saying that he would be a few minutes late because of traffic. He showed up perhaps 15 minutes late, not a problem at all, and got right to work. He finished within about 3 1/2 hours, slightly longer than I thought it would take, but the work was very good. This company charges by the hour or fraction thereof, something I especially appreciate since I didn't want to have to pay for a full 4th hour when he only worked a portion of it. Overall, I think this company is slightly pricey, but the work was solid and they are punctual, responsible, and courteous--very important things in my book. I would definitely contact them again."
4,Very well. The young carpenter did all the work. He had to go to Lowes/Home Depot for the replacement wood and stain. (I had purchased the light fixtures.) He charged me for the materials and minimal extra time. I was very satisfied with all the tasks.
5,"Mr. handyman was late about one half hour on the 1st day. Other than that one time, punctuality was good. He promised to call me each day after he finished his work, but I never got a call. Those with only problems. The work done was quality work and I'm quite pleased with the result. I can now enter my home through the front door with my power chair. In my home is more secure new deadbolts, in front and back. My refrigerator is making ice. I like the work so much that I asked Mr. handyman to look at some of the jobs that need to be done around the house and in the yard."
5,I was pleased with the work they did.
5,"Came on time, completed work, cleaned up."
5,"They came the same day that I called. They were on time and it only took them about 15 minutes to do the work. I had purchased a unit for $138 from Home Depot because I thought they would need the piece, however he told he didn’t need it. I was able to take it back and get a refund, so they ended up saving me some money as well."
5,"They charged on an hourly rate and they were expensive. However, they did a great job."
5,"I called Mr. Handyman, Alan, and explained to him it was an unusual job but after some discussion and feedback, I decided to go forward. The young man who came out was professional, on-time and friendly. I explained the service I needed completed and he got to work. When I returned at the end of the day I was very happy with the results. The workmanship was spot on and the detail was excellent. Basically he had to create a custom mount for the hoop and backboard. My father, who is an architect ""oversaw"" the work as I was not able to be there at the time. He was impressed with the detail and design that was put into the project. The only comment I would make is that this was a two person job and my dad had to help a couple of times. He is 70 and is not in the best shape so that made me uncomfortable. However it was a minor detail and overall the work was done to expectations. Based on this one experience I will utilize their services again. Thanks Mr. Handyman."
5,"They called me a little before the original time they had quoted to say he was available after his last appointment ended a little early. It was a good time for me, so he came out, looked over the job, put down a drop cloth, asked where he could access water, and then brought his tools in. He did a great job covering the crack in the ceiling and when he left, it wasn't quite dry, but looked much better. The next day, you wouldn't know there was ever a crack there."
5,They do the work on hourly basis. The man that they sent was flexible in terms of what he was able to do. He was quite pleasant and was willing to work with me. He was professional and friendly. It was the best price.
5,"I sent out quote requests to a few different companies and Mr. Handyman was the most responsive, the owner and I exchanged emails several times. Their price was good compared to the other estimates I got. I was not actually home when the work was completed, I was at work and my housemate was home instead. I would have asked for the mudding to be smoothed out a bit more, but I can't fault them for leaving it as they did as I was not there and it wasn't bad so I could not justify calling them back. I'm also a bit pickier than most people, ah well. I'd definitely hire them again though, so no true complaints only praises."
5,"The young man that was doing the work was very considerate because I was immobile, so he would take pictures of what he was doing and would come downstairs and show me each step of the project, and I thought that was pretty nice of him. They were a nice company to deal with. They were nice, good people. The price was fair. I had to check into some prices on their installation and I thought the price was fair for everything that they did. I might use them again for something else a couple of weeks from now. This was right before Christmas and I was surprised that they came out, when they did, I was very happy with them. They were here right on time, when they said they were going to be here. They said eight ‘O clock and they were here. The young man was very good at his job and what he did was excellent."
5,I think they did a good job and the workman arrived when he was supposed to. He was very courteous and friendly; I think he did a good job. I think the price was a little high for the amount of work that he did but it was something that needed to be done so it was fine. He was only here for a few hours.
5,They were fine and they did exactly what they needed to do.
5,"They really did an excellent job. They were responsive, punctual and professional."
5,"My 1st experience with this company and angie's list was very positive. I discussed that repairs were needed to the siding of the house and the contractor, Jeremiah, was out and fixed it within 2 days. He came out when they said he would. Jeremiah noted that the siding was originally installed incorrectly and that an option would be to replace vs repair it. I decided to just have it repaired for now. I inspected the finished work, and it was great. I was afraid the heavy winds we just experienced after he repaired it would rip it off again!I This company, Mr. Handyman, did a follow up call to see if I was satisfied. They ""get"" the importance of positive word of mouth and recommendations from angies list. This was a small job, only $170. but they did great. I recommend you call them for jobs including ""small"" jobs too!"
1,"Version:1.0 StartHTML:0000000105 EndHTML:0000002843 StartFragment:0000002290 EndFragment:0000002807 First they cound do all the work. They wouldn?t come to my home ti check out things and give an estimate. They wanted to come out and do the work, first hour $200 one person hour $100, how stupid do they think your members are. They should rename their company from ?Mr.Handyman? to ?Sucker Hunters?. This was my first Angie?s List experience. Hope not my last."
5,"After we dipped, stripped, sanded, primed and painted the 50 shutters, they needed to be rehung. The other company canceled out 4 times over a month (not due to the weather) so I fired them. I used Angie's List and called Mr. Handyman. Great response! They came out a few days later, arrived exactly on time, did all the work which took five hours and didn't even stop for lunch. They worked hard and rehung all my shutters. That is a ""fun"" job on a 40 foot ladder! We are totally satisfied with their responsiveness and work. The mechanics were friendly, did the work efficiently and well. They even found a woodpecker hole in a hidden area of the siding and fixed it. They just did it rather than diddle around waiting for an OK to spend 15 minutes on the task. That was appreciated."
5,"Was excellent job..just adding a review now ,because a neighbor needs Caulking done on their bathroom & possible tub door. They asked us who did ours ..I was sure it was Mr Handyman ,but was not sure of location. My cancelled check showed the Owings Mills location..The gentleman who did the work was the best, On time & our location is not always easy to find. Professional ,Friendly. I should have entered this review at time of the work , but just moved in and got busy. I would recommend them highly. I can't believe that others rated them B on pricing .I was thrilled with the price , I absolutely got what I paid for if not more. A+ in my book"
5,He completed all the repairs correctly and quick. He was all business and everything he fixed is working properly. I was satisfied with his work but I do feel he could have completed the work a little bit cleaner which is just a minor detail. On a scale of 1-10 I would give him a 9.
5,"We were impressed from start to finish. We have done a lot of remodeling on our 1920's bungalow ourselves over the years so we appreciate what goes into labor. When I described our project to Ken over the phone he immediately knew what needed to be done and how long it would take so we felt like he ""knew his stuff."" When I called to schedule the appointment they were able to perform the job within a few days. They arrived early making it more convenient for us and they finished the job in less time than we expected. We know that cutting through plaster and lathe is messy job and we were impressed with how clean they kept everything. We were very pleased with their service and would definitely recommend them and plan on using them for future projects."
5,"Could not be happier with the entire job. He not only did excellent work throughout the entire process, but several times gave me suggestions that would save me money on the repairs. He was able to fix a basement water problem that led to water damage that another Handyman service failed to solve."
5,"I contacted Mr. Handyman to get a leak (from rains) in my garage and bathroom repaired. I had got this problem looked at in the past and all previous repairs did not work. The service professional from Mr. Handyman arrived for the appointment on time. He detected the cause of the leak and made another appointment to come out and fix it as the job would have taken a long time to finish.As this was a two person job the owner also came to assist on the day of the job. The job was done very well and with meticulous attention to detail. He explained the problems that he saw and even took photographs of the areas that were causing the leaks and texted them to me later. To my delight, after completing the job the owner followed up with me after the first major rain storm. The leak had been mostly plugged but I could still see a little bit of water coming through. He came out again within the next 2 days, retested for the leak, and again spent 2 to 3 hours fixing the issue."
5,"This was my first experience with Angie's List and also the first tiem hiring a handyman. I was very impressed with Mr. Handyman. They were very responsive, punctual, and professional. I would definitely use this company again."
5,"Mr Handyman is very professional, start to finish. They called to let me know the approximate time the worker was coming, then they followed up to make sure I was happy with the work. The Handyman was very nice, clean and knowledgeable. He installed 3 light fixtures, one which had a slight problem in how the previous fixture was hung and he handled that no problem. I was very happy with their work and their responsiveness to my needs."
1,"Very unprofessional and prejudice. Update 8/27/2012: After I left my review on Angie's List Mr. Deitch called me on Monday morning and harassed and threatened me regarding the review. I found that his professionalism has its limits. He is very responsive, which I appreciated, but I strongly suggest hiring someone else."
5,"A big thanks to Alan and Brian! I needed a very important job done the next day. It turned out to require MUCH more time than anticipated (because i was in a panic and did not state the number of windows). But Alan adjusted the work schedule for the day, took one of the jobs himself and my job was completed that day! Brian worked so hard in the heat and was kind and professional. Thank you so much!"
1,"Mr. Handyman, Ken, cancelled my appointment three times; he said that he had emergencies each time. I rescheduled my appointment each time to get estimates for home repairs. The latest appointment was today and he just didn't show up. I called the office to see if he was indeed coming after he didn't show up at the appointment time. At this point, I told the people in the office to just not even send him. This was my 1st and last experience with Mr. Handyman. If Ken really didn't want the job, he should have never set the appointments. Very disappointed..."
3,"The company is very responsive and I appreciated being able to communicate via email. I asked for and got an estimate. Although I confirmed the appointment for a certain time the contractor had a scheduling problem and had to arrive about 1 hour later. Especially after reading the prices for the work performed for others in their reviews, and realizing the actual work that was performed for me, I believe I paid too much for the work."
5,"Alan returned my initial phone call immediately and although the job was small one, he still accommodated us. At all times he and his partner were very professional and courteous. Thank you very much!"
5,"Mr Handyman is the best! Called Alan and set up an appt. Alan is very accomodating and knows his stuff. Anthony came out on the scheduled day right on time and ready to work. I cannot say enough about Anthony. He is hard-working, professional, very knowledgable, and extremely respectful of your home and family. You can tell he tries very hard to make the ""someone in your house working"" aspect as non-intrusive as possible. But on top of all this is the actual work he does. All I can say is he is a perfectionist. Impeccable! We love our new bathroom, because it really does look like a brand new bathroom. We are already making plans to have him come out again. Thank you Alan and Anthony!"
5,"After trying and failing to replace a leaking water line to my refrigerator myself I scheduled a repair appointment with Sears only to be contacted the day of that they don't do plumbing. I had some electrical work that needed to be done as well, so I looked for someone who could do both. I was a little hesitant to use a handyman company due to a previous experience when the repairman was unable to complete the work I specifically requested, and I ended up looking for things for him to do since I had to pay anyway. The benefit of having one person do it all led me to call Mr Handyman of Baltimore County. I called early in the morning and they were able to fit me in that afternoon. I was reassured that if they were unable to do the work as promised, I would not be charged. The repairman showed up an hour early. He was very efficient in his work and had a clear understanding of what was involved. He was able to perform both the plumbing and electrical work and was kind enough to let me watch so I could understand what I had done wrong with the refrigerator line. I had been told ahead of time to pick up the replacement items I wanted and I did have to run back to the hardware store while the repairman was here to exchange one of the items, but that allowed him to keep working. He finished all the work in a little over 2 hours and left everything very neat. I thought it was expensive, but if I had hired a plumber and an electrician I'm sure it would have cost me more and I would have had to find time in my schedule for 2 appointments. Overall I was very pleased and would hire them again."
4,"Called company via listing number on Angie's List. Was able to make contact with Alan right away who discussed job, asked for digital photos and quoted rates. We initially thought it was a post in the ground but after taking pictures I found out that the post was bolted onto the side of the stairs. I also discovered that the top-knob decoration on the existing post was a separate piece of decorative wood that would be removable. I had paint on hand from a new paint job that was completed in the prior couple of weeks. Alan scheduled a visit for Friday May 4 and estimated that the total work would probably be 4 hours, including time taken to source the 4x4 post, prepare it, mount it and paint it. Given cost of supplies and Mr. Handyman's hourly rates, the estimate was right on the money. Overall work was passable if not totally matching. The major missing parts were small and I discovered them well after providing payment: - The corners of the replacement wood were not sanded/beveled, so they don't quite exactly match the rest of the bannister.- The reused top decoration for the post was not remounted entirely centered. Painting was decent and matched. All other work was done satisfactorily, but the waste was not disposed of (this was part of the original understanding and quote). Overall, a good job, with some minor quality issues that prevent an all A's rating, but a good effort. I got what I paid for."
5,"The ""handyman"" that came was professional, and polite, did the prescribed work and even followed me to the home improvement store to get the replacement door. Cant say enough good things about the final product. The only downside is it was a bit pricey, but for the service provided, excellent!"
5,I contacted Alan on Monday about the work to be done. He had a man at my house on Wednesday morning. We went over the work to be done and I left him alone. In a few hours he was done and my steps were once again safe to walk on.
5,"Don arrived right on time and easily installed a new (replacement) lighting fixture over my dining table. He was very patient with my fretting about the height of the pendant over the table! I also had him do some exterior touch up painting to keep my HOA happy. I had thought I should replace my louvred gable vent with a pvc one, but when he went up to measure it, it wasn't in as bad shape as I'd thought, so he just puttied and repainted it. And he measured it so that when I do need to get it replaced, I'll know the correct size. He was very nice, pleasant, and knowledgable. I have used Mr. Handyman before and will use them in the future."
5,I think it is a franchise. They are fabulous. I have used them on numerous occasions and they do everything. They are not cheap but they work well and they are very efficient. They do the work right and they are fair. I would use their services again in the future.
5,"They were on time, and they got the job done quickly. They were very thorough."
5,"Great company. Honest, punctual and stands by their work"
5,It was a very good experience. The name of the person who came out was Peter and he was very efficient. He seemed to know exactly what he had to do and did it and did it in good time. He cleaned up after himself. I would use them again in the future.
4,Overall work was great. Called back about 3 times to get more things done. A little expensive due to pay scale but worht it.
5,"He was punctual, professional, and productive with his time."
5,"As usual Chris did an excellent job. He arrived on time and got right to work, as their price is calculated at an hourly rate. Upon creating an opening to our attic, we found out that the were nests that birds have built throughout the years. Chris cleaned the mess and nests and enclosed our attic vents with wiry mesh to alleviate the bird problem. Again he stayed over (not included in the price) and answered questions and quoted us on future jobs. I think that they are a little pricey but what you pay for is what you get and it is well worth it. I believe that Chris has become our official handyman! Also, Alan is a pleasure to speak with on the phone!"
5,Professional work performed by Sean. Job site was kept neat and clean during and at the conclusion of the service call. Time was well managed. Could'nt have gone better.
5,"From start to finish I felt comfortable with this company. Reading the reviews about this company, I had high expectations. And they showed up! Alan was very pleasent, patient, friendly and professional when I spoke with him on the phone to make the appointment. Chris came to our house and did the job as promised. He showed and was very professional and pleasent to talk to. He came and got right to work after listening to all of my concerns; he was extremely efficient and didn't waste any time. After he was done he stayed and spoke with me and my husband about concerns and questions we had about other jobs we are planning. He is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I am looking forward to their services again and I absolutely reccommend them for any work that you might have. Well done!"
5,They came out same day for appointment and commenced work following day. Completed day after that. Very responsive and professional.
4,"Great, and our handyman was very pleasant and courteous and thoughtful in his work and remarks."
5,"I was super happy with them! They were responsive, showed up on time, professional, and the work was done as promised. I would highly recommend them."
5,"It looks terrific. He measured thoroughly and always asked us what we wanted before doing anything so it was just how we wanted. He was a little slow which did effect price, but I think it was because he was being so careful, which we really appreciated."
5,Everything was great. Very professional and punctual. Were willing to come out same day. We will definitely hire them again!
5,Excellent from start to finish. Couldn't be happier
4,"They are pretty good. I haven't had any problems with them. It is the second thing I have had done. The price is a little high, but their service is worth it. I had to call back a couple of times to get them so I can't give them highest marks for responsiveness. I will use them again in the future."
5,"I called Mr. Handyman in the morning for an estimate to install a new over the range microwave. They were able to have someone out in the afternoon of the same day to complete the job! The technician was on time, very friendly, very clean and very fast. I highly recommend Mr. Handyman."
5,No surprises all was explained before hand. Doug did an excellent job. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Ken Dunn's operation and especially Doug . We have been using Ken's Mr. Handyman since 2009. We have always been pleased and have recommended him t several people.
5,"The technician was very prompt and arrived at the scheduled time. I explained what I wanted done. He did the work in the order that I wanted done. In the repairs of the window, he also cleaned off putty that has been put on by other parties. He blew off the roof with a small electric blower that was barely up to what was required. He was very good at checking the gutters for cleanliness. The repairs to the two sections of gutter that had been damaged by falling branches were makeshift. He did not explain any alternate solutions such as replacement of the sections. I was impressed by how quickly he worked but would have been happier with a better repair of the gutters."
5,"The experience was very good. They price was reasonable, and he was very responsive."
5,excellent service from start to finish will use again
3,"Overall, the experience was okay. He was able to find & fix the leak, but he ended up cutting a hole in the ceiling of my living room without offering any way of fixing the hole, even if there would have been an initial charge. He stapled some Saran wrap on the ceiling where the hole is. Now I'm in the process of fixing the ceiling hole through another vendor."
5,"The project(s) went very well and were completed in less time than I had expected. The technician was very competent, professional, personable, and well organized. He also provided some valuable tips and advice regarding a couple of other issues."
5,"Chris with Mr Handyman was EXCELLENT!! He completed several handyman tasks on my ~80 year-old home this fall. He was efficient, professional and very pleasant. He completed the work more quickly than anticipated, and made helpful suggestions for cost-saving options. He even cleaned up after himself! I will definitely use him for my future handyman needs."
3,This member has no knowledge of how this review has become associated with this member’s account.
5,"Mr. Handyman came promptly at 800am went over the checklist and got to work, went through the checklist item by item, did not waste anytime, worked hard, took a 15min break for lunch, finished at 430pm. Finally after many many months my long list was done in one-day. Amazing."
5,I called Mr. Handyman in the morning and they sent a technician the same afternoon. He arrived (his name is Mr. White) on time with a smile on his face and a professional attitude. He was eager to help tackle the two pictures. He explained the billing process clearly and began installing the molding. He also offered time saving tips (since I was charged by the half hour) like opening products to be used and arranging them around the room where they needed to be placed. Mr. White was thorough in centering the frames and installed the undercounter lights neatly and quickly. I was well pleased with these services and will call them today for another project!
5,"We were very pleased with our experience. The handyman did a great job, and there were three things that stood out for us: 1. Punctuality and promptness, start to finish. I got a fast callback after I submitted my inquiry on the web and the handyman was right on time. 2. We really felt like he was trying to do his best for us - pointing out things that could be done on our own easily, and mentioning a couple of roofing issues that he discovered while cleaning the gutters (and was able to fix right away). We appreciated the honesty and felt like they were really intending to provide us value for our money. 3. He even gave us some tips on how to do a couple of jobs that we plan to do ourselves better/more easily. We will definitely call them again the next time we have a need for handyman services!"
5,"They come on time, they clean up after themselves, and they do the work with minimal hassle. They have came out twice and I would reccomend them highly."
5,"First of all, I submitted a request for service online, and literally someone called me within a half hour of my request. The person who called me was the owner, and he was extremely nice. The handyman comes in a market van, and he worked very neatly and was very professional. He seemed able to do a lot of things. He did an excellent job on the guest room - - and the repairs needed were pretty extensive. He was unable to repair the ceiling fan because it needed a part; it wasn't the easiest to troubleshoot - - but I felt he understood all the possible issues and worked to isolate the problem. All in all, I just found it so nice that in one phone call you could have multiple projects done - - so simple."
5,"the fix was perfect. Technician was on time, and creative in the fix."
5,"Mr. Handyman was outstanding. The work was finished timely and the estimates were close to the actual bill. It was wonderful to have Mr. Handyman fix the issues that came with my new home, allowing me to come home and relax."
5,Great. They came when they said and did the work quickly and well.
5,"He was great. The whole experience with this company was great, the went way beyond what most companies would do. Since I live out of state they made me feel very confident about my property. I will use them again and recommend the to others in that area."
5,"Mr. Handyman called me back. After I explained what I need to have done, he told me that this particular job really required a licensed plumber. So he gave me a referral to a plumber and I have been very happy with the referral. I really appreciated Mr. Handyman's honesty, professionalism, anmd integrity."
5,"The service is extremely professional and convenient to use. Great for an out of town landlord. They take time to explain work etc. Rates are high given that I've found good handy men for ~$50/hr etc. However, if you need to insure you get a dependable and trustworthy contractor, this is an excellent option."
5,"They were very professional, responsive and easy to work with in all cases. I actually referred them to several of my friends and will use them in the future."
5,"He was punctual and very professional and courteous. He did an excellent job, and even went to the store to get the right shade of paint since the one I had was no longer good. He was neat and did not leave a mess. I was very happy with everything that was done."
5,"The job went well, with good results."
5,"Extremely pleased. The project turned out better than I ever could have imagined. Their professionalism was exceptional. I felt comfortable leaving them my keys and they completed the bulk of the work while I was out of town. The hourly rate of this company is a bit hirer than others, but they are extremely quick, efficient and professional in the execution fo the projects. I believe in the end the total price is lower than their competitors because they finish projects in much less time, and the end results are impeccable."
5,"Task1. was installed in two visits. First visit involved repair of two 24""x30"" holes created by removal of two in-wall air conditioning units by HVAC contractor. Units were in the knee walls of the third floor of our 1935 wood shingle home. Chris arrived promptly, as scheduled, sized up job and worked diligently, most of which was on done on the ladder. He successfully found a lumberyard that had shingles that matched those on our house, primed and painted the installed shingles. Work was done so seamlessly that you can't tell where the repairs were made. Second visit involved removal of an in-wall window size air conditioning unit on the first floor. Repairs were made to the exterior shingled wall as well as drywall repair to the interior wall. Again, Chris was able to find a lumberyard that carried molding that matched the existing interior molding. The first two jobs were so well done, we consulted with Alan and Chris about Task 2, installing hardwood flooring in our third floor master bedroom. Previous owners had converted the attic into a master bedroom suite. Original flooring was pine with wall-to-wall carpeting. Stairs leading to third floor were also pine. Alan estimated material needed and provided suggestions of where to find good quality flooring at reasonable prices. Following selection of flooring and stairs, we called Alan to schedule installation of the flooring while we were on vacation. We returned home to a beautifully installed floor and stairs. We had one minor mishap, during the flooring installation. Sawing of the flooring tripped our smoke alarm. Chris immediately called us to let us know what had happened (seconds after being called by ADT), we were able to arrange for ADT to turn off the alarm. To avoid any chance of a recurrence, Chris performed all additional sawing outside. All work was done extremely professionally and clean up was excellent"
2,"On 1/20, I spoke with Ken and scheduled an appointment for 9:00 AM on 1/26 for an estimate. When no one arrived by 9:20, I called the office. Ken could not locate the painter and did not know why he did not show up. The estimate was recheduled for 1/27 at 8:30. When his painter arrived the next day, there was no apology offered. I showed him the work to be done and he told me Ken would call me the next day. I did not get a phone call on 1/28, so I called Ken on 1/29. His receptionist told me he would call me right back in a few minutes. No phone call. I called back 90 minutes later and was told by the receptionist that an estimate would be mailed that day. On 2/2, there was still no estimate. I called once more and was told it was mailed last week. It is now 8 days later and I still have no estimate, verbal or written, from this company."
5,"This is the best experience I have ever had with a home handyman (in 35 years of hiring them). I was doubtful based on past experience that this could go very well, but was so very pleasantly surprised. Not cheap, but given that he didn't waste my time or his, he had proper equipment, and he was knowledgeable I think it was well worth the cost."
5,"Chris was on time, very polite, and professional. He completed the job in a timely manner. The chair rail looks great. He cut each piece at a 45 degree angle so they fit together seamlessly. Then he caulked all the nail holes and seams. The only problem was that the job took longer than the manager had estimated on the phone, so it was more pricey than we originally thought. Other than that, we were very pleased with the work!"
5,"Alan and Chris are both experienced contracters and they do superb work. They did not waste time, were cooperative and friendly. ."
5,They came and did a whole day's worth of work. The price was a little high but it's hard for a handyman not to charge that much.
5,The person that showed up knew what he was doing. He was easy to direct and worked efficiently.
5,Outstanding job. Very satisfied.
5,Very well.
5,They were very helpful.
5,"They were excellent. They had a 4-hour minimum. They were extremely good. Whatever I asked the tech to do, he did. I would certainly hire him again. He cleaned up and everything was left in fine condition. The price was good because it would have been difficult to coordinate that many different people to do the various jobs."
5,The time to do the requested jobs was pretty much on target. I felt like they were using their time wisely and efficiently. This fellow that they sent out clearly knew what he was doing and was able to tick the items off the list that we needed.
5,"I called the company on Friday evening and got the answering service who told me the company would be in touch with me on Monday morning. They called around 8:30 AM Monday and asked me to describe the work. He told me they charge $138.00 for the first hour or fraction thereof and $88 for each additional hour which is billed in 15 minute increments at $22. When I agreed he said they would be out between 1:00 and 3:00 PM Monday, and would call approximately 1/2 hour before arriving. They called back around 9:45 AM and said they were running ahead of schedule and could come earlier if it was convenient for me, which it was. At about 10:30 AM the technician arrived. I showed him the electric eye and the dryer. He set about his work and was finished in about 45 minutes. I inspected the work and he did an excellent job, I was quite pleased."
5,"Very punctual. Work was of high quality. Although cost of replacing screens was high, I can't say if someone who charges by the job would have been less. The job took longer then originally thought, but removing the old screens was more difficult then expected. This was because of the way siding around the area had been attached by someone else. The quality of the work was excellent so the cost was worth it. Worker was professional and personable. I would use them again, and plan to in the fall for some jobs we discussed. Highly recommended."
4,"The deck job that they did for us went very well. The price was reasonable and the quality of work was great. I had called the company again for another estimate on a different job. I talked to the receptionist in the office and she said she'd take the message. However, I never got a call back from the company. This was the only bad experience that we had with this company."
5,"Mr. Handyman showed up at the time appointed, dressed in a uniform and driving a Van with a Mr. Handyman advertisement on it. This was good because I live in a small condominium and it is reassuring to elderly neighbors. The A/C units had been permanently installed in old casement windows on the 2nd floor, so I was very reluctant to tackle the removal on my own. He had the units out very quickly and used storm windows to create a replacement pane. There was time left so he unclogged some drains, which I was very glad because one turned out to be completely rusted through. I had to get a different plumber to replace that drain, because it is a very old building and we only use one licensed plumber. But I had Mr Handyman come back to fix some tiles. I also had holes in the ceiling from where the electrician had been. Mr. Handyman fixed those holes beautifully! I could tell this guy had extensive experience with drywall. I dealt with Ken on the phone and 2 different guys came out to do the work. Ken is very easy to deal with and they are professional. I am pleased to have the work done (so is my husband! I got rid of the ""honey-do list"")."
5,The experience was great with the office staff and Alan who was efficient and very professional and explained the process as he was doing the projects.
5,"I had a shower installed by a reputable contractor. Unfortunately, his installation of the shower was not up to code and the drain failed, which caused a massive leak in my kitchen ceiling. I called Mr. Handyman, and they sent a technician, who replaced the drywall in the ceiling and feathered the edges so that the patch will look like the remainder of the kitchen ceiling. It was nice to have a contractor, show up on time, be experienced, clean up, and be able to speak and understand English. I would highly recommend this company."
5,"Excellent experience. The process of making the appointment was easy and professional. The representative (Alan) was punctual, professional, knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. He showed concern in maximizing the efficient use of time, readily answered questions, and offered helpful suggestions. Would gladly use this firm again, and am planning to do so in the future."
5,"They gave me an estimate over the phone. They were able to do the work sooner than scheduled. He hustled and did not waste any time. He was helpful, knowledgeable, and eager to do the work. He was honest and did not try to sell me things that I didn't need. They are accommodating."
5,They came when they said they were going to come. They handyman who came out was very thorough and reliable. They did what they said they were gonna do.
5,"We called Mr. Handyman, based on reports in Angie's List, about a week ago, and were able to schedule the work within the week. Before Alan appeared, the company called to confirm the appointment. Alan showed up exactly on time, and worked steadily all day long until the job was completed. His boss, Alan Deitch, even appeared early on to see how things were going, and stayed for quite awhile to help. We were very pleased with the professionalism of the two men who showed up, and the excellent job that was done to reroof our shed. It is now better than it was when it was new."
5,"He arrived on time, dressed in uniform with a truck full of what he needed to make that floor perfect. He replaced one full sheet of plywood, purchasing and hauling a new sheet of plywood up to my third floor (no elevator) co-op, and hauled away and disposed of the old sheet of plywood. He was pleasant, polite, knowledgeable and efficient. The dispatcher was also wonderful, calling to tell me that he might be early. She was efficient and very personable as well. I will definitely use them again!"
5,They have come several times and done some small and large jobs for us. They have remodeled several rooms for us and have done a wonderful job. We have been very satisfied with the services they have done for us. The technician that was assigned to us has been excellent and very detail oriented.
5,"He arrived on time & was very helpful. My only small concern was that he needed to spend part of his time going to the store to buy the threshold piece. Since I'd told the company ahead of time I thought that was needed, it would have been nice if they had sent that along. (In retrospect, he also could have given me a shopping list so I could get it while he was shaving the door). The run to the store added a fair amt of time to the job. Overall, it went well. I'm glad he was there because I also had a plumber doing other work who needed a hand getting an old water heater out of the house, and it was fortunate that Mr Handyman was there to, well, be handy. I'd use them again, but only if I had enough tasks to take at least 2 hr, and if possible I'd try to have supplies available (I could always return unneeded parts)."
1,"Overall this went badly. The work was done poorly, I felt very overcharged and cheated. The worker came on time, started with the Lazy Susan, moved on to the toilet paper holder and then left my home. He returned about 15 minutes later and finished all work after one hour and 10 minutes, not two hours. I was charged for two hours and parts: Spackle, drywall putty, screen, 50 lb. dry wall anchors, which he went to the hardware store to buy. I think a handyman service, especially when they know the job to be done, should be prepared with the appropriate parts. The ceiling was a mess when he left, screen showing, not smoothed off at all. Lazy Susan broke again about two weeks later."
5,"The work was outstanding. I had asked for around five estimates before I hired him and even if he was not the cheapest one, the price was completely fair and reasonable. I called and they gave me an estimate over the phone."
5,He was very thorough. He actually showed me what he was doing and overall he was very professional. I even added a job while he was here and he was able to take care of that for me.
5,"I would definitely call this company again. They were courteous over the phone, and Dave was prompt, friendly, and worked like a dog. The project went into a second day, and the company rescheduled Dave so that he could come back two days after the first one to finish the job."
4,"Overall the job went well. We set up an appointment for three weeks after we called. Mr. Handyman called a few days before the appointment to confirm. On the day of the appointment, we received a call from the contractor letting us know that the employee that was scheduled to come out to the house had called out sick. They did send another employee out that same day to do the work. John, did come later than we scheduled for. He arrived at 4:35 p.m. and got right to work on the dry rot. While the wood filler was drying, he replaced the shutters. John told us that the wood filler was not completely dry so he would have to return the next day. He did return at 5:55 p.m. the next day to paint the wood. It took a little under an hour. When we checked the work everything seemed fine, but the next day we noticed that the wood filler had sunken in. We wrote to Mr. Handyman to let them know and they promptly sent John and another employee out to correct the problem at no charge."
5,"Called on a Tues. & was told Thu. & Fri. were available. On Wed., these times were gone; I couldn't find anyone else, so on Thu., set up appt. for following Thu. They are pricey: $216 for the first 2 hours, thereafter billed in 15 min increments @$88/hr. For that price, you get highly qualified technician. We opted to buy most of the stuff beforehand, but the tech did need to shop for some specialty items. The tech was supposed to show up at 8a, but had car trouble. Mary, the office mgr., called me at 8:05a to let me know this; he showed up at 9a and finished by 2p. Most impressive: fixing the kitchen exhaust fan; it would been quite costly to replace this. He also didn't have to replace the garbage disposal as we thought was necessary: wires just needed to be connected correctly. The tech was pleasant and knowledgeable. Mary was very helpful on the initial call. Would definitely use them again and highly recommend them to others."
5,"Allen, the manager was professional providing an estimate on the phone when I called for a job. The job I described sounded like 2-3 hours job and Rickie came 30min. late due to an accident on the road. One of the problem was a long hole on the main door and Rickie suggested that the door is not secure and I decided to replace it. It ended up costing me a lot, but I think it was a right decision. I could tell he had done it many many times. We went to shopping, he took the old doors and everything out, adjusted the wall from 83inches to 80 inches and put the new doors in. It was great that even though he was supposed to be there for 2-3hours, he asked Allen to move other schedule and stayed a whole day to get it done. He cared details and the job was done well."
