We can't say enough good things about this service!!"
5,"Jared did an outstanding, perfect job as always! Floors looked wonderful as well as everything else. He is very sensitive to the environment and especially used products that did not irritate an ill family member during a long illness. He could not be more helpful, kind and flexible. Everything is done with very high standards of excellence."
2,"While the actual work done by the provider was initially more than satisfactory, there are some details that force me to write a negative review. The man who did the cleaning arrived quite late because he had been given the wrong street name by the company. Apparently this forced him to rush through the cleaning in order to make his next scheduled appointment on time. He did an excellent job of cl...

5,"Pablo and Maria come every 2 weeks, and we love it when they do. The house is so clean after they come. They arrive exactly when they say they will. They bring all their tools and cleaners and special tricks with them. In 2-4 hours, the 2 of them work so hard and clean the house so well, it sparkles when they are done. Pablo and Maria are a great team and they are very pleasant while they are here...

She is very efficient, and our house is always super-clean after she is done. She is also a great communicator and always gets in touch and communicates any schedule or other changes related to the cleaning in advance. We real...

5,They did an excellent job. I was very happy with the team that came out and the work done by all of them. Their pricing is very fair and I plan on using them on a regular basis.
5,"Dominique does a terrific job. Bathrooms and kitchen sparkle and the rest of my place is dust & dirt free. When I request a change, she is always willing to work with me. I couldn't be more pleased. She's usually on time and if she is going to be delayed she always calls and let's me know. She is a jewel."
5,"This is my third time using their service. Ray is great. My house isn't a disaster, but he makes everything sparkle. My faucets are shiny, Stains left by a contractor when installing two sinks were removed by him today. I'm happy. I am happy not to have to clean the hardwood floors anymore. The owners are very responsive and the price is fair."
5,"Arrived on time. brought all needed supplies including a steam mop for tile floors which really was different from any other cleaning service I have hired before. It made the house feel alot cleaner. also, got cobwebs from high places. went above and beyond what one just sees. Monique was excellent."

I was TOTALLY stressing my home going on the market and having a bunch of ""handyman"" things to get done and Krisitna and Jareds Service came to my RESCUE. they sent over Ray who seriously knocked it out of the park.

I don't think I would use them in future until I call them and remind them of some things that they missed. If they resolve that then I w...

There was lots of dog hair, dirt & dust everywhere but that didn't deter them. We went through the priorities at the beginning and within 5 minutes they were at it. I do feel they are a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. Other less costly services I've us...

5,I hired them through Angie’s List for housecleaning. It’s Kristina and Jareds Cleaning and Handyman Service. I’m happy with them. The cost is $100 each time. Only one cleaner comes to clean for about 4 hours.
5,It took them a long time but that was because the job warranted That amount of time and the house was a complete mess! I am so gratefull for them staying and cleaning as much as they did I can't wait for them to come back and finish the rest of my house... I have been able to upkeep what they did and when they finish they will need to keep coming back as my home is just too big a job for me!
5,"So far, we are very pleased with the job done by Jared. Our bathtub and shower are the cleanest we have ever seen them. He brings his own cleaning products, which are all natural, and they leave the house smelling very good. However, he respects our requests to use certain products on our new furniture, in keeping with the manufacturers recommendations. He seems knowledgeable about the best produc...
